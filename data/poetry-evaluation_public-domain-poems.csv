Geoffrey Chaucer,?–1400,The Canterbury Tales: General Prologue,"Here bygynneth the Book of the tales of Caunterbury

Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote, 
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote, 
And bathed every veyne in swich licóur 
Of which vertú engendred is the flour; 
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth 
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth 
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne 
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, 
And smale foweles maken melodye, 
That slepen al the nyght with open ye, 
So priketh hem Natúre in hir corages, 
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, 
And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes, 
To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes; 
And specially, from every shires ende 
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende, 
The hooly blisful martir for to seke, 
That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke. 
 
Bifil that in that seson on a day, 
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay, 
Redy to wenden on my pilgrymage 
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage, 
At nyght were come into that hostelrye 
Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye 
Of sondry folk, by áventure y-falle 
In felaweshipe, and pilgrimes were they alle, 
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde. 
The chambres and the stables weren wyde, 
And wel we weren esed atte beste. 
And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste, 
So hadde I spoken with hem everychon, 
That I was of hir felaweshipe anon, 
And made forward erly for to ryse, 
To take oure wey, ther as I yow devyse. 
 
But nathelees, whil I have tyme and space, 
Er that I ferther in this tale pace, 
Me thynketh it acordaunt to resoun 
To telle yow al the condicioun 
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me, 
And whiche they weren and of what degree, 
And eek in what array that they were inne; 
And at a Knyght than wol I first bigynne. 
 
A Knyght ther was, and that a worthy man, 
That fro the tyme that he first bigan 
To riden out, he loved chivalrie, 
Trouthe and honóur, fredom and curteisie. 
Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre, 
And thereto hadde he riden, no man ferre, 
As wel in cristendom as in hethenesse, 
And evere honóured for his worthynesse. 
At Alisaundre he was whan it was wonne; 
Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne 
Aboven alle nacions in Pruce. 
In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,— 
No cristen man so ofte of his degree. 
In Gernade at the seege eek hadde he be 
Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye. 
At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye, 
Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See 
At many a noble armee hadde he be. 
 
At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene, 
And foughten for oure feith at Tramyssene 
In lyste thries, and ay slayn his foo. 
This ilke worthy knyght hadde been also 
Somtyme with the lord of Palatye 
Agayn another hethen in Turkye; 
And evermoore he hadde a sovereyn prys. 
And though that he were worthy, he was wys, 
And of his port as meeke as is a mayde. 
He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde, 
In al his lyf, unto no maner wight. 
He was a verray, parfit, gentil knyght. 
 
But for to tellen yow of his array, 
His hors weren goode, but he was nat gay; 
Of fustian he wered a gypon 
Al bismótered with his habergeon; 
For he was late y-come from his viage, 
And wente for to doon his pilgrymage. 
 
With hym ther was his sone, a yong Squiér, 
A lovyere and a lusty bacheler, 
With lokkes crulle as they were leyd in presse. 
Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse. 
Of his statúre he was of evene lengthe, 
And wonderly delyvere and of greet strengthe. 
And he hadde been somtyme in chyvachie 
In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Pycardie, 
And born hym weel, as of so litel space, 
In hope to stonden in his lady grace. 
Embrouded was he, as it were a meede 
Al ful of fresshe floures whyte and reede. 
Syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day; 
He was as fressh as is the month of May. 
Short was his gowne, with sleves longe and wyde; 
Wel koude he sitte on hors and faire ryde; 
He koude songes make and wel endite, 
Juste and eek daunce, and weel purtreye and write. 
So hoote he lovede that by nyghtertale 
He sleep namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale. 
Curteis he was, lowely and servysáble, 
And carf biforn his fader at the table. 
 
A Yeman hadde he and servántz namo 
At that tyme, for hym liste ride soo; 
And he was clad in cote and hood of grene. 
A sheef of pecock arwes bright and kene, 
Under his belt he bar ful thriftily— 
Wel koude he dresse his takel yemanly; 
His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe— 
And in his hand he baar a myghty bowe. 
A not-heed hadde he, with a broun viságe. 
Of woodecraft wel koude he al the uságe. 
Upon his arm he baar a gay bracér, 
And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler, 
And on that oother syde a gay daggere, 
Harneised wel and sharp as point of spere; 
A Cristophere on his brest of silver sheene. 
An horn he bar, the bawdryk was of grene. 
A forster was he, soothly as I gesse. 
 
Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse, 
That of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy; 
Hire gretteste ooth was but by seinte Loy, 
And she was cleped madame Eglentyne. 
Ful weel she soong the service dyvyne, 
Entuned in hir nose ful semely; 
And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly, 
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe, 
For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe. 
At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle: 
She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle, 
Ne wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe. 
Wel koude she carie a morsel and wel kepe 
Thát no drope ne fille upon hire brist; 
In curteisie was set ful muchel hir list. 
Hire over-lippe wyped she so clene 
That in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sene 
Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte. 
Ful semely after hir mete she raughte. 
And sikerly she was of greet desport, 
And ful plesáunt and amyable of port, 
And peyned hire to countrefete cheere 
Of court, and been estatlich of manere, 
And to ben holden digne of reverence. 
But for to speken of hire conscience, 
She was so charitable and so pitous 
She wolde wepe if that she saugh a mous 
Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde. 
Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde 
With rosted flessh, or milk and wastel breed; 
But soore wepte she if oon of hem were deed, 
Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte; 
And al was conscience and tendre herte. 
 
Ful semyly hir wympul pynched was; 
Hire nose tretys, her eyen greye as glas, 
Hir mouth ful smal and ther-to softe and reed; 
But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed; 
It was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe; 
For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe. 
Ful fetys was hir cloke, as I was war; 
Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar 
A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene, 
And ther-on heng a brooch of gold ful sheene, 
On which ther was first write a crowned A, 
And after, Amor vincit omnia. 
 
Another Nonne with hire hadde she, 
That was hire chapeleyne, and Preestes thre. 
 
A Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrie, 
An outridere, that lovede venerie; 
A manly man, to been an abbot able. 
Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable; 
And whan he rood, men myghte his brydel heere 
Gýnglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleere, 
And eek as loude, as dooth the chapel belle, 
Ther as this lord was kepere of the celle. 
The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit, 
By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,— 
This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace, 
And heeld after the newe world the space. 
He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen 
That seith that hunters ben nat hooly men, 
Ne that a monk, whan he is recchelees, 
Is likned til a fissh that is waterlees,— 
This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre. 
But thilke text heeld he nat worth an oystre; 
And I seyde his opinioun was good. 
What sholde he studie and make hymselven wood, 
Upon a book in cloystre alwey to poure, 
Or swynken with his handes and labóure, 
As Austyn bit? How shal the world be served? 
Lat Austyn have his swynk to him reserved. 
Therfore he was a prikasour aright: 
Grehoundes he hadde, as swift as fowel in flight; 
Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare 
Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare. 
I seigh his sleves y-púrfiled at the hond 
With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond; 
And for to festne his hood under his chyn 
He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pyn; 
A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was. 
His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas, 
And eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt. 
He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt; 
His eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed, 
That stemed as a forneys of a leed; 
His bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat. 
Now certeinly he was a fair prelaat. 
He was nat pale, as a forpyned goost: 
A fat swan loved he best of any roost. 
His palfrey was as broun as is a berye. 
 
A Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merye, 
A lymytour, a ful solémpne man. 
In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan 
So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage. 
He hadde maad ful many a mariage 
Of yonge wommen at his owene cost. 
Unto his ordre he was a noble post. 
Ful wel biloved and famulier was he 
With frankeleyns over al in his contree, 
And eek with worthy wommen of the toun; 
For he hadde power of confessioun, 
As seyde hym-self, moore than a curát, 
For of his ordre he was licenciat. 
Ful swetely herde he confessioun, 
And plesaunt was his absolucioun. 
He was an esy man to yeve penaunce 
There as he wiste to have a good pitaunce; 
For unto a povre ordre for to yive 
Is signe that a man is wel y-shryve; 
For, if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt 
He wiste that a man was répentaunt; 
For many a man so hard is of his herte 
He may nat wepe al-thogh hym soore smerte. 
Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyéres 
Men moote yeve silver to the povre freres. 
His typet was ay farsed full of knyves 
And pynnes, for to yeven faire wyves. 
And certeinly he hadde a murye note: 
Wel koude he synge and pleyen on a rote; 
Of yeddynges he baar outrely the pris. 
His nekke whit was as the flour-de-lys; 
Ther-to he strong was as a champioun. 
He knew the tavernes wel in every toun, 
And everich hostiler and tappestere 
Bet than a lazar or a beggestere; 
For unto swich a worthy man as he 
Acorded nat, as by his facultee, 
To have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce; 
It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce 
Fór to deelen with no swich poraille, 
But al with riche and selleres of vitaille. 
And over-al, ther as profit sholde arise, 
Curteis he was and lowely of servyse. 
Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous. 
He was the beste beggere in his hous; 
[And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt, 
Noon of his brethren cam ther in his haunt;] 
For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho, 
So plesaunt was his In principio, 
Yet wolde he have a ferthyng er he wente: 
His purchas was wel bettre than his rente. 
And rage he koude, as it were right a whelpe. 
In love-dayes ther koude he muchel helpe, 
For there he was nat lyk a cloysterer 
With a thredbare cope, as is a povre scolér, 
But he was lyk a maister, or a pope; 
Of double worstede was his semycope, 
That rounded as a belle, out of the presse. 
Somwhat he lipsed for his wantownesse, 
To make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge; 
And in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe, 
His eyen twynkled in his heed aryght 
As doon the sterres in the frosty nyght. 
This worthy lymytour was cleped Hubérd. 
 
A Marchant was ther with a forked berd, 
In motteleye, and hye on horse he sat; 
Upon his heed a Flaundryssh bevere hat; 
His bootes clasped faire and fetisly. 
His resons he spak ful solémpnely, 
Sownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng. 
He wolde the see were kept for any thing 
Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle. 
Wel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle. 
This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette; 
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette, 
So estatly was he of his gouvernaunce, 
With his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunce. 
For sothe he was a worthy man with-alle, 
But, sooth to seyn, I noot how men hym calle. 
 
A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also, 
That unto logyk hadde longe y-go. 
As leene was his hors as is a rake, 
And he nas nat right fat, I undertake, 
But looked holwe, and ther-to sobrely. 
Ful thredbare was his overeste courtepy; 
For he hadde geten hym yet no benefice, 
Ne was so worldly for to have office; 
For hym was lévere háve at his beddes heed 
Twénty bookes, clad in blak or reed, 
Of Aristotle and his philosophie, 
Than robes riche, or fíthele, or gay sautrie. 
But al be that he was a philosophre, 
Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre; 
But al that he myghte of his freendes hente 
On bookes and on lernynge he it spente, 
And bisily gan for the soules preye 
Of hem that yaf hym wher-with to scoleye. 
Of studie took he moost cure and moost heede. 
Noght o word spak he moore than was neede; 
And that was seyd in forme and reverence, 
And short and quyk and ful of hy senténce. 
Sownynge in moral vertu was his speche; 
And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche. 
 
A Sergeant of the Lawe, war and wys, 
That often hadde been at the Parvys, 
Ther was also, ful riche of excellence. 
Discreet he was, and of greet reverence— 
He semed swich, his wordes weren so wise. 
Justice he was ful often in assise, 
By patente, and by pleyn commissioun. 
For his science and for his heigh renoun, 
Of fees and robes hadde he many oon. 
So greet a purchasour was nowher noon: 
Al was fee symple to hym in effect; 
His purchasyng myghte nat been infect. 
Nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas, 
And yet he semed bisier than he was. 
In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle 
That from the tyme of kyng William were falle. 
Ther-to he koude endite and make a thyng, 
Ther koude no wight pynche at his writyng; 
And every statut koude he pleyn by rote. 
He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote, 
Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale; 
Of his array telle I no lenger tale. 
 
A Frankeleyn was in his compaignye. 
Whit was his berd as is the dayesye; 
Of his complexioun he was sangwyn. 
Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn; 
To lyven in delit was evere his wone, 
For he was Epicurus owene sone, 
That heeld opinioun that pleyn delit 
Was verraily felicitee parfit. 
An housholdere, and that a greet, was he; 
Seint Julian he was in his contree. 
His breed, his ale, was alweys after oon; 
A bettre envyned man was nowher noon. 
Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous, 
Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentevous, 
It snewed in his hous of mete and drynke, 
Of alle deyntees that men koude thynke, 
After the sondry sesons of the yeer; 
So chaunged he his mete and his soper. 
Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe, 
And many a breem and many a luce in stuwe. 
Wo was his cook but if his sauce were 
Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geere. 
His table dormant in his halle alway 
Stood redy covered al the longe day. 
At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire; 
Ful ofte tyme he was knyght of the shire. 
An anlaas, and a gipser al of silk, 
Heeng at his girdel, whit as morne milk. 
A shirreve hadde he been, and a countour; 
Was nowher such a worthy vavasour. 
 
An Haberdasshere, and a Carpenter, 
A Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapycer,— 
And they were clothed alle in o lyveree 
Of a solémpne and a greet fraternitee. 
Ful fressh and newe hir geere apiked was; 
Hir knyves were chaped noght with bras, 
But al with silver; wroght ful clene and weel 
Hire girdles and hir pouches everydeel. 
Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys 
To sitten in a yeldehalle, on a deys. 
Éverich, for the wisdom that he kan, 
Was shaply for to been an alderman; 
For catel hadde they ynogh and rente, 
And eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente, 
And elles certeyn were they to blame. 
It is ful fair to been y-cleped Madame, 
And goon to vigilies al bifore, 
And have a mantel roialliche y-bore. 
 
A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones, 
To boille the chiknes with the marybones, 
And poudre-marchant tart, and galyngale. 
Wel koude he knowe a draughte of Londoun ale. 
He koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and frye, 
Máken mortreux, and wel bake a pye. 
But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me, 
That on his shyne a mormal hadde he; 
For blankmanger, that made he with the beste. 
 
A Shipman was ther, wonynge fer by weste; 
For aught I woot he was of Dertemouthe. 
He rood upon a rouncy, as he kouthe, 
In a gowne of faldyng to the knee. 
A daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he 
Aboute his nekke, under his arm adoun. 
The hoote somer hadde maad his hewe al broun; 
And certeinly he was a good felawe. 
Ful many a draughte of wyn hadde he y-drawe 
Fro Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep. 
Of nyce conscience took he no keep. 
If that he faught and hadde the hyer hond, 
By water he sente hem hoom to every lond. 
But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes, 
His stremes, and his daungers hym bisides, 
His herberwe and his moone, his lode-menage, 
Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage. 
Hardy he was and wys to undertake; 
With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake. 
He knew alle the havenes, as they were, 
From Gootlond to the Cape of Fynystere, 
And every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne. 
His barge y-cleped was the Maudelayne. 
 
With us ther was a Doctour of Phisik; 
In all this world ne was ther noon hym lik, 
To speke of phisik and of surgerye; 
For he was grounded in astronomye. 
He kepte his pacient a ful greet deel 
In houres, by his magyk natureel. 
Wel koude he fortunen the ascendent 
Of his ymáges for his pacient. 
He knew the cause of everich maladye, 
Were it of hoot, or cold, or moyste, or drye, 
And where they engendred and of what humour. 
He was a verray, parfit praktisour; 
The cause y-knowe, and of his harm the roote, 
Anon he yaf the sike man his boote. 
Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries 
To sende him drogges and his letuaries; 
For ech of hem made oother for to wynne, 
Hir frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne. 
Wel knew he the olde Esculapius, 
And De{""y}scorides, and eek Rufus, 
Old Ypocras, Haly, and Galyen, 
Serapion, Razis, and Avycen, 
Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn, 
Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn. 
Of his diete mesurable was he, 
For it was of no superfluitee, 
But of greet norissyng and digestíble. 
His studie was but litel on the Bible. 
In sangwyn and in pers he clad was al, 
Lyned with taffata and with sendal. 
And yet he was but esy of dispence; 
He kepte that he wan in pestilence. 
For gold in phisik is a cordial; 
Therfore he lovede gold in special. 
 
A Good Wif was ther of biside Bathe, 
But she was som-del deef, and that was scathe. 
Of clooth-makyng she hadde swich an haunt 
She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt. 
In al the parisshe wif ne was ther noon 
That to the offrynge bifore hire sholde goon; 
And if ther dide, certeyn so wrooth was she 
That she was out of alle charitee. 
Hir coverchiefs ful fyne weren of ground; 
I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound 
That on a Sonday weren upon hir heed. 
Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed, 
Ful streite y-teyd, and shoes ful moyste and newe. 
Boold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe. 
She was a worthy womman al hir lyve; 
Housbondes at chirche dore she hadde fyve, 
Withouten oother compaignye in youthe; 
But ther-of nedeth nat to speke as nowthe. 
And thries hadde she been at Jérusalem; 
She hadde passed many a straunge strem; 
At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne, 
In Galice at Seint Jame, and at Coloigne. 
She koude muchel of wandrynge by the weye. 
Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye. 
Upon an amblere esily she sat, 
Y-wympled wel, and on hir heed an hat 
As brood as is a bokeler or a targe; 
A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large, 
And on hire feet a paire of spores sharpe. 
In felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe; 
Of remedies of love she knew per chauncé, 
For she koude of that art the olde daunce. 
 
A good man was ther of religioun, 
And was a povre Person of a Toun; 
But riche he was of hooly thoght and werk. 
He was also a lerned man, a clerk, 
That Cristes Gospel trewely wolde preche; 
His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche. 
Benygne he was, and wonder diligent, 
And in adversitee ful pacient; 
And swich he was y-preved ofte sithes. 
Ful looth were hym to cursen for his tithes, 
But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute, 
Unto his povre parisshens aboute, 
Of his offrýng and eek of his substaunce; 
He koude in litel thyng have suffisaunce. 
Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer asonder, 
But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder, 
In siknesse nor in meschief to visíte 
The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lite, 
Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf. 
This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf, 
That first he wroghte and afterward he taughte. 
Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte; 
And this figure he added eek therto, 
That if gold ruste, what shal iren doo? 
For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste, 
No wonder is a lewed man to ruste; 
And shame it is, if a prest take keep, 
A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep. 
Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive 
By his clennesse how that his sheep sholde lyve. 
He sette nat his benefice to hyre 
And leet his sheep encombred in the myre, 
And ran to Londoun, unto Seinte Poules, 
To seken hym a chaunterie for soules, 
Or with a bretherhed to been withholde; 
But dwelte at hoom and kepte wel his folde, 
So that the wolf ne made it nat myscarie; 
He was a shepherde, and noght a mercenarie. 
And though he hooly were and vertuous, 
He was to synful man nat despitous, 
Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne, 
But in his techyng díscreet and benygne. 
To drawen folk to hevene by fairnesse, 
By good ensample, this was his bisynesse. 
But it were any persone obstinat, 
What so he were, of heigh or lough estat, 
Hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys. 
A bettre preest I trowe that nowher noon ys. 
He waited after no pompe and reverence, 
Ne maked him a spiced conscience; 
But Cristes loore and his apostles twelve 
He taughte, but first he folwed it hymselve. 
 
With hym ther was a Plowman, was his brother, 
That hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother; 
A trewe swynkere and a good was he, 
Lyvynge in pees and parfit charitee. 
God loved he best, with al his hoole herte, 
At alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte. 
And thanne his neighebor right as hymselve. 
He wolde thresshe, and therto dyke and delve, 
For Cristes sake, for every povre wight, 
Withouten hire, if it lay in his myght. 
His tithes payede he ful faire and wel, 
Bothe of his propre swynk and his catel. 
In a tabard he rood upon a mere. 
 
Ther was also a Reve and a Millere, 
A Somnour and a Pardoner also, 
A Maunciple, and myself,—ther were namo. 
 
The Millere was a stout carl for the nones; 
Ful byg he was of brawn and eek of bones. 
That proved wel, for over-al, ther he cam, 
At wrastlynge he wolde have alwey the ram. 
He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre; 
Ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre, 
Or breke it at a rennyng with his heed. 
His berd as any sowe or fox was reed, 
And therto brood, as though it were a spade. 
Upon the cop right of his nose he hade 
A werte, and thereon stood a toft of herys, 
Reed as the brustles of a sowes erys; 
His nosethirles blake were and wyde. 
A swerd and a bokeler bar he by his syde. 
His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys; 
He was a janglere and a goliardeys, 
And that was moost of synne and harlotries. 
Wel koude he stelen corn and tollen thries; 
And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee. 
A whit cote and a blew hood wered he. 
A baggepipe wel koude he blowe and sowne, 
And therwithal he broghte us out of towne. 
 
A gentil Maunciple was ther of a temple, 
Of which achátours myghte take exemple 
For to be wise in byynge of vitaille; 
For, wheither that he payde or took by taille, 
Algate he wayted so in his achaat 
That he was ay biforn and in good staat. 
Now is nat that of God a ful fair grace, 
That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace 
The wisdom of an heep of lerned men? 
Of maistres hadde he mo than thries ten, 
That weren of lawe expert and curious, 
Of whiche ther weren a duszeyne in that hous 
Worthy to been stywardes of rente and lond 
Of any lord that is in Engelond, 
To maken hym lyve by his propre good, 
In honour dettelees, but if he were wood, 
Or lyve as scarsly as hym list desire; 
And able for to helpen al a shire 
In any caas that myghte falle or happe; 
And yet this Manciple sette hir aller cappe 
 
The Reve was a sclendre colerik man. 
His berd was shave as ny as ever he kan; 
His heer was by his erys round y-shorn; 
His top was dokked lyk a preest biforn. 
Ful longe were his legges and ful lene, 
Y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene. 
Wel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne; 
Ther was noon auditour koude on him wynne. 
Wel wiste he, by the droghte and by the reyn, 
The yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn. 
His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye, 
His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye, 
Was hoolly in this reves governyng; 
And by his covenant yaf the rekenyng 
Syn that his lord was twenty yeer of age; 
There koude no man brynge hym in arrerage. 
There nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyne, 
That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne; 
They were adrad of hym as of the deeth. 
His wonyng was ful fair upon an heeth; 
With grene trees shadwed was his place. 
He koude bettre than his lord purchace; 
Ful riche he was a-stored pryvely. 
His lord wel koude he plesen subtilly, 
To yeve and lene hym of his owene good, 
And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood. 
In youthe he hadde lerned a good myster; 
He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter. 
This Reve sat upon a ful good stot, 
That was al pomely grey, and highte Scot. 
A long surcote of pers upon he hade, 
And by his syde he baar a rusty blade. 
Of Northfolk was this Reve of which I telle, 
Biside a toun men clepen Baldeswelle. 
Tukked he was as is a frere, aboute. 
And evere he rood the hyndreste of oure route. 
 
A Somonour was ther with us in that place, 
That hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face, 
For sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe. 
As hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe, 
With scaled browes blake and piled berd,— 
Of his visage children were aferd. 
Ther nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon, 
Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon, 
Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte, 
That hym myghte helpen of his whelkes white, 
Nor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes. 
Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes, 
And for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood. 
Thanne wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood. 
And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn, 
Than wolde he speke no word but Latyn. 
A fewe termes hadde he, two or thre, 
That he had lerned out of som decree,— 
No wonder is, he herde it al the day; 
And eek ye knowen wel how that a jay 
Kan clepen ""Watte"" as wel as kan the pope. 
But whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope, 
Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie; 
Ay ""Questio quid juris"" wolde he crie. 
He was a gentil harlot and a kynde; 
A bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde. 
He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn 
A good felawe to have his concubyn 
A twelf month, and excuse hym atte fulle; 
And prively a fynch eek koude he pulle. 
And if he foond owher a good felawe, 
He wolde techen him to have noon awe, 
In swich caas, of the erchedekenes curs, 
But if a mannes soule were in his purs; 
For in his purs he sholde y-punysshed be: 
""Purs is the erchedekenes helle,"" seyde he. 
But wel I woot he lyed right in dede. 
Of cursyng oghte ech gilty man him drede, 
For curs wol slee, right as assoillyng savith; 
And also war him of a Significavit. 
In daunger hadde he at his owene gise 
The yonge girles of the diocise, 
And knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed. 
A gerland hadde he set upon his heed, 
As greet as it were for an ale-stake; 
A bokeleer hadde he maad him of a cake. 
 
With hym ther rood a gentil Pardoner 
Of Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer, 
That streight was comen fro the court of Rome. 
Ful loude he soong, ""Com hider, love, to me!"" 
This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun; 
Was nevere trompe of half so greet a soun. 
This Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex, 
But smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex; 
By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde, 
And therwith he his shuldres overspradde. 
But thynne it lay, by colpons, oon and oon; 
But hood, for jolitee, wered he noon, 
For it was trussed up in his walét. 
Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet; 
Dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bare. 
Swiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare. 
A vernycle hadde he sowed upon his cappe. 
His walet lay biforn hym in his lappe, 
Bret-ful of pardoun, comen from Rome al hoot. 
A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot. 
No berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have, 
As smothe it was as it were late y-shave; 
I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare. 
But of his craft, fro Berwyk into Ware, 
Ne was ther swich another pardoner; 
For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer, 
Which that, he seyde, was Oure Lady veyl; 
He seyde he hadde a gobet of the seyl 
That Seinte Peter hadde, whan that he wente 
Upon the see, til Jesu Crist hym hente. 
He hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones, 
And in a glas he hadde pigges bones. 
But with thise relikes, whan that he fond 
A povre person dwellynge upon lond, 
Upon a day he gat hym moore moneye 
Than that the person gat in monthes tweye; 
And thus with feyned flaterye and japes 
He made the person and the peple his apes. 
But trewely to tellen atte laste, 
He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste; 
Wel koude he rede a lessoun or a storie, 
But alderbest he song an offertorie; 
For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe, 
He moste preche, and wel affile his tonge 
To wynne silver, as he ful wel koude; 
Therefore he song the murierly and loude. 
 
Now have I toold you shortly, in a clause, 
Thestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause 
Why that assembled was this compaignye 
In Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye 
That highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle. 
But now is tyme to yow for to telle 
How that we baren us that ilke nyght, 
Whan we were in that hostelrie alyght; 
And after wol I telle of our viage 
And al the remenaunt of oure pilgrimage. 
 
But first, I pray yow, of youre curteisye, 
That ye narette it nat my vileynye, 
Thogh that I pleynly speke in this mateere, 
To telle yow hir wordes and hir cheere, 
Ne thogh I speke hir wordes proprely. 
For this ye knowen al-so wel as I, 
Whoso shal telle a tale after a man, 
He moot reherce, as ny as evere he kan, 
Everich a word, if it be in his charge, 
Al speke he never so rudeliche and large; 
Or ellis he moot telle his tale untrewe, 
Or feyne thyng, or fynde wordes newe. 
He may nat spare, althogh he were his brother; 
He moot as wel seye o word as another. 
Crist spak hymself ful brode in hooly writ, 
And wel ye woot no vileynye is it. 
Eek Plato seith, whoso kan hym rede, 
""The wordes moote be cosyn to the dede."" 
 
Also I prey yow to foryeve it me, 
Al have I nat set folk in hir degree 
Heere in this tale, as that they sholde stonde; 
My wit is short, ye may wel understonde. 
 
Greet chiere made oure Hoost us everichon, 
And to the soper sette he us anon, 
And served us with vitaille at the beste: 
Strong was the wyn and wel to drynke us leste. 
 
A semely man Oure Hooste was with-alle 
For to been a marchal in an halle. 
A large man he was with eyen stepe, 
A fairer burgeys was ther noon in Chepe; 
Boold of his speche, and wys, and well y-taught, 
And of manhod hym lakkede right naught. 
Eek thereto he was right a myrie man, 
And after soper pleyen he bigan, 
And spak of myrthe amonges othere thynges, 
Whan that we hadde maad our rekenynges; 
And seyde thus: ""Now, lordynges, trewely, 
Ye been to me right welcome, hertely; 
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye, 
I saugh nat this yeer so myrie a compaignye 
At ones in this herberwe as is now. 
Fayn wolde I doon yow myrthe, wiste I how; 
And of a myrthe I am right now bythoght, 
To doon yow ese, and it shal coste noght. 
 
""Ye goon to Canterbury—God yow speede, 
The blisful martir quite yow youre meede! 
And wel I woot, as ye goon by the weye, 
Ye shapen yow to talen and to pleye; 
For trewely confort ne myrthe is noon 
To ride by the weye doumb as a stoon; 
And therfore wol I maken yow disport, 
As I seyde erst, and doon yow som confort. 
And if you liketh alle, by oon assent, 
For to stonden at my juggement, 
And for to werken as I shal yow seye, 
To-morwe, whan ye riden by the weye, 
Now, by my fader soule, that is deed, 
But ye be myrie, I wol yeve yow myn heed! 
Hoold up youre hond, withouten moore speche."" 
 
Oure conseil was nat longe for to seche; 
Us thoughte it was noght worth to make it wys, 
And graunted hym withouten moore avys, 
And bad him seye his verdit, as hym leste. 
 
""Lordynges,"" quod he, ""now herkneth for the beste; 
But taak it nought, I prey yow, in desdeyn; 
This is the poynt, to speken short and pleyn, 
That ech of yow, to shorte with oure weye 
In this viage, shal telle tales tweye, 
To Caunterbury-ward, I mene it so, 
And homward he shal tellen othere two, 
Of aventúres that whilom han bifalle. 
And which of yow that bereth hym beste of alle, 
That is to seyn, that telleth in this caas 
Tales of best sentence and moost solaas, 
Shal have a soper at oure aller cost, 
Heere in this place, sittynge by this post, 
Whan that we come agayn fro Caunterbury. 
And, for to make yow the moore mury, 
I wol myselven gladly with yow ryde, 
Right at myn owene cost, and be youre gyde; 
And whoso wole my juggement withseye 
Shal paye al that we spenden by the weye. 
And if ye vouche-sauf that it be so, 
Tel me anon, withouten wordes mo, 
And I wol erly shape me therfore."" 
 
This thyng was graunted, and oure othes swore 
With ful glad herte, and preyden hym also 
That he wolde vouche-sauf for to do so, 
And that he wolde been oure governour, 
And of our tales juge and réportour, 
And sette a soper at a certeyn pris; 
And we wol reuled been at his devys 
In heigh and lough; and thus, by oon assent, 
We been acorded to his juggement. 
And therupon the wyn was fet anon; 
We dronken, and to reste wente echon, 
Withouten any lenger taryynge. 
 
Amorwe, whan that day gan for to sprynge, 
Up roos oure Hoost and was oure aller cok, 
And gadrede us togidre alle in a flok; 
And forth we riden, a litel moore than paas, 
Unto the wateryng of Seint Thomas; 
And there oure Hoost bigan his hors areste, 
And seyde, ""Lordynges, herkneth, if yow leste: 
Ye woot youre foreward and I it yow recorde. 
If even-song and morwe-song accorde, 
Lat se now who shal telle the firste tale. 
As ever mote I drynke wyn or ale, 
Whoso be rebel to my juggement 
Shal paye for all that by the wey is spent. 
Now draweth cut, er that we ferrer twynne; 
He which that hath the shorteste shal bigynne. 
Sire Knyght,"" quod he, ""my mayster and my lord 
Now draweth cut, for that is myn accord. 
Cometh neer,"" quod he, ""my lady Prioresse. 
And ye, sire Clerk, lat be your shamefastnesse, 
Ne studieth noght. Ley hond to, every man."" 
 
Anon to drawen every wight bigan, 
And, shortly for to tellen as it was, 
Were it by áventúre, or sort, or cas, 
The sothe is this, the cut fil to the Knyght, 
Of which ful blithe and glad was every wyght; 
And telle he moste his tale, as was resoun, 
By foreward and by composicioun, 
As ye han herd; what nedeth wordes mo? 
And whan this goode man saugh that it was so, 
As he that wys was and obedient 
To kepe his foreward by his free assent, 
He seyde, ""Syn I shal bigynne the game, 
What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name! 
Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye."" 
And with that word we ryden forth oure weye; 
And he bigan with right a myrie cheere 
His tale anon, and seyde in this manére.",couplet,stanza forms,"['The Body', 'The Mind', 'Love', 'Activities', 'Eating & Drinking', 'Jobs & Working', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Spring', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Reading & Books', 'Sciences', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Money & Economics', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43926/the-canterbury-tales-general-prologue,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/geoffrey-chaucer,,,1400.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Jalal al-Din Rumi,1207–1273,“Where did the handsome beloved go?”,"Where did the handsome beloved go?
I wonder, where did that tall, shapely cypress tree go?

He spread his light among us like a candle.
Where did he go? So strange, where did he go without me?

All day long my heart trembles like a leaf.
All alone at midnight, where did that beloved go?

Go to the road, and ask any passing traveler — 
That soul-stirring companion, where did he go?

Go to the garden, and ask the gardener — 
That tall, shapely rose stem, where did he go?

Go to the rooftop, and ask the watchman — 
That unique sultan, where did he go?

Like a madman, I search in the meadows!
That deer in the meadows, where did he go?

My tearful eyes overflow like a river — 
That pearl in the vast sea, where did he go?

All night long, I implore both moon and Venus — 
That lovely face, like a moon, where did he go?

If he is mine, why is he with others?
Since he’s not here, to what “there” did he go?

If his heart and soul are joined with God,
And he left this realm of earth and water, where did he go?

Tell me clearly, Shams of Tabriz,
Of whom it is said, “The sun never dies” — where did he go?

Petrarch,1304 – 1374,Sonnet 131 [I’d sing of Love in such a novel fashion],"I’d sing of Love in such a novel fashion
that from her cruel side I would draw by force
a thousand sighs a day, kindling again
in her cold mind a thousand high desires;

I’d see her lovely face transform quite often
her eyes grow wet and more compassionate,
like one who feels regret, when it’s too late,
for causing someone’s suffering by mistake;

And I’d see scarlet roses in the snows,
tossed by the breeze, discover ivory
that turns to marble those who see it near them;

All this I’d do because I do not mind 
my discontentment in this one short life,
but glory rather in my later fame.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Fathers', 'Translation']","From The Poetry of Petrarch by Petrarch, translated by David Young. Translation copyright © 2004 by David Young. Reprinted by permission of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. All rights reserved.

John Skelton,1460–1529,The Book of Phillip Sparrow,"Pla ce bo, 
Who is there, who? 
Di le xi, 
Dame Margery; 
Fa, re, my, my, 
Wherfore and why, why? 
For the sowle of Philip Sparowe, 
That was late slayn at Carowe, 
Among the Nones Blake, 
For that swete soules sake, 
And for all sparowes soules, 
Set in our bederolles, 
Pater noster qui, 
With an Ave Mari,  
And with the corner of a Crede, 
The more shalbe your mede. 
 
Whan I remembre agayn 
How mi Philyp was slayn, 
Never halfe the payne 
Was betwene you twayne, 
Pyramus and Thesbe, 
As than befell to me: 
I wept and I wayled, 
The tearys downe hayled; 
But nothinge it avayled 
To call Phylyp agayne, 
Whom Gyb our cat hath slayne. 
 
Gib, I saye, our cat, 
Worrowyd her on that 
Which I loved best: 
It can not be exprest 
My sorowfull hevynesse, 
But all without redresse; 
For within that stounde, 
Halfe slumbrynge, in a swounde 
I fell downe to the grounde. 
 
Unneth I kest myne eyes 
Towarde the cloudy skyes: 
But whan I dyd beholde 
My sparow dead and colde, 
No creatuer but that wolde 
Have rewed upon me, 
To behold and se 
What hevynesse dyd me pange; 
Wherewith my handes I wrange, 
That my senaws cracked, 
As though I had ben racked, 
So payned and so strayned, 
That no lyfe wellnye remayned. 
 
I syghed and I sobbed, 
For that I was robbed 
Of my sparowes lyfe. 
O mayden, wydow, and wyfe, 
Of what estate ye be, 
Of hye or lowe degre, 
Great sorowe than ye myght se, 
And lerne to wepe at me! 
Such paynes dyd me frete, 
That myne hert dyd bete, 
My vysage pale and dead, 
Wanne, and blewe as lead; 
The panges of hatefull death 
Wellnye had stopped my breath. 
Heu, heu, me, 
That I am wo for the! 
Ad Dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi:  
Of God nothynge els crave I 
But Phyllypes soule to kepe 
From the marees deepe 
Of Acherontes well, 
That is a flode of hell; 
And from the great Pluto, 
The prynce of endles wo; 
And from foule Alecto, 
With vysage blacke and blo; 
And from Medusa, that mare, 
That lyke a fende doth stare; 
And from Megeras edders, 
For rufflynge of Phillips fethers, 
And from her fyry sparklynges, 
For burnynge of his wynges; 
And from the smokes sowre 
Of Proserpinas bowre; 
And from the dennes darke, 
Wher Cerberus doth barke, 
Whom Theseus dyd afraye, 
Whom Hercules dyd outraye, 
As famous poetes say; 
From that hell-hounde, 
That lyeth in cheynes bounde, 
With gastly hedes thre, 
To Jupyter pray we 
That Phyllyp preserved may be! 
Amen, say ye with me! 
 
Do mi nus,  
Helpe nowe, swete Jesus! 
Levavi oculos meos in montes:  
Wolde God I had Zenophontes, 
Or Socrates the wyse 
To shew me their devyse, 
Moderatly to take 
This sorrow that I make 
For Phylyp Sparowes sake! 
So fervently I shake, 
I fele my body quake; 
So urgently I am brought 
Into carefull thought. 
Like Andromach, Hectors wyfe, 
Was wery of her lyfe, 
Whan she had lost her joye, 
Noble Hector of Troye; 
In lyke maner also 
Encreaseth my dedly wo, 
For my sparowe is go. 
 
It was so prety a fole, 
It wold syt on a stole, 
And lerned after my scole 
For to kepe his cut, 
With, ""Phyllyp, kepe your cut!"" 
 
It had a velvet cap, 
And wold syt upon my lap, 
And seke after small wormes, 
And somtyme white bred crommes; 
And many tymes and ofte 
Betwene my brestes softe

John Skelton,1460–1529,The Tunning of Elenor Rumming,"Tell you I chyll,
If that ye wyll
A whyle be styll,
Of a comely gyll
That dwelt on a hyll:
But she is not gryll,
For she is somwhat sage
And well worne in age;
For her vysage
It would aswage
A mannes courage.

Her lothely lere
Is nothynge clere,
But ugly of chere,
Droupy and drowsy,
Scurvy and lowsy;
Her face all bowsy,
Comely crynkled,
Woundersly wrynkled,
Lyke a rost pygges eare,
Brystled wyth here.

Her lewde lyppes twayne,
They slaver, men sayne,
Lyke a ropy rayne,
A gummy glayre:
She is ugly fayre;
Her nose somdele hoked,
And camously croked,
Never stoppynge,
But ever droppynge;
Her skynne lose and slacke,
Grained lyke a sacke;
With a croked backe.

Her eyen gowndy
Are full unsowndy,
For they are blered;
And she gray hered;
Jawed lyke a jetty;
A man would have pytty
To se how she is gumbed,
Fyngered and thumbed,
Gently joynted,
Gresed and annoynted
Up to the knockles;
The bones of her huckels
Lyke as they were with buckels
Togyther made fast:
Her youth is farre past:
Foted lyke a plane,
Legged lyke a crane;
And yet she wyll jet,
Lyke a jollyvet,
In her furred flocket,
And gray russet rocket,
With symper the cocket.
Her huke of Lyncole grene,
It had ben hers, I wene,
More then fourty yere;
And so doth it apere,
For the grene bare thredes
Loke lyke sere wedes,
Wyddered lyke hay,
The woll worne away;
And yet I dare saye
She thynketh herselfe gaye
Upon the holy daye,
Whan she doth her aray,
And gyrdeth in her gytes
Stytched and pranked with pletes;
Her kyrtel Brystow red,
With clothes upon her hed
That wey a sowe of led,
Wrythen in wonder wyse,
After the Sarasyns gyse
With a whym wham,
Knyt with a trym tram,
Upon her brayne pan,
Lyke an Egyptian,
Capped about:
When she goeth out
Herselfe for to shewe,
She dryveth downe the dewe
Wyth a payre of heles
As brode as two wheles;
She hobles as a gose
With her blanket hose
Over the falowe;
Her shone smered wyth talowe,
Gresed upon dyrt
That baudeth her skyrt.

And this comely dame,
I understande, her name
Is Elynour Rummynge,
At home in her wonnynge;
And as men say
She dwelt in Sothray,
In a certayne stede
Bysyde Lederhede.
She is a tonnysh gyb;
The devyll and she be syb.

But to make up my tale,
She breweth noppy ale,
And maketh therof port sale
To travellars, to tynkers,
To sweters, to swynkers,
And all good ale drynkers,
That wyll nothynge spare,
But drynke tyll they stare
And brynge themselfe bare,
With, ""Now away the mare,
And let us sley care,
As wyse as an hare!""

Come who so wyll
To Elynour on the hyll,
Wyth, ""Fyll the cup, fyll,""
And syt there by styll,
Erly and late:
Thyther cometh Kate,
Cysly, and Sare,
With theyr legges bare,
And also theyr fete,
Hardely, full unswete;
Wyth theyr heles dagged,
Theyr kyrtelles all to-jagged,
Theyr smockes all to-ragged,
Wyth titters and tatters,
Brynge dysshes and platters,
Wyth all theyr myght runnynge
To Elynour Rummynge,
To have of her tunnynge:
She leneth them on the same.
And thus begynneth the game.

Instede of coyne and monny,
Some brynge her a conny,
And some a pot with honny,
Some a salt, and some a spone,
Some theyr hose, some theyr shone;
Some ran a good trot
With a skellet or a pot;
Some fyll theyr pot full
Of good Lemster woll:
An huswyfe of trust,
Whan she is athrust,
Suche a webbe can spyn,
Her thryft is full thyn.

Some go streyght thyder,
Be it slaty or slyder;
They holde the hye waye,
They care not what men say,
Be that as be maye;
Some, lothe to be espyde,
Start in at the backe syde,
Over the hedge and pale,
And all for the good ale.

Some renne tyll they swete,
Brynge wyth them malte or whete,
And dame Elynour entrete
To byrle them of the best.

Than cometh an other gest;
She swered by the rode of rest,
Her lyppes are so drye,
Without drynke she must dye;
Therefore fyll it by and by,
And have here a pecke of ry.

Anone cometh another,
As drye as the other,
And wyth her doth brynge
Mele, salte, or other thynge,
Her harvest gyrdle, her weddyng rynge,
To pay for her scot
As cometh to her lot.
Som bryngeth her husbandes hood,
Because the ale is good;
Another brought her his cap
To offer to the ale-tap,
Wyth flaxe and wyth towe;
And some brought sowre dowe;
Wyth, ""Hey, and wyth, Howe,
Syt we downe a-rowe,
And drynke tyll we blowe,
And pype tyrly tyrlowe!""

Some layde to pledge
Theyr hatchet and theyr wedge,
Theyr hekell and theyr rele,
Theyr rocke, theyr spynnyng whele;
And some went so narrowe,
They layde to pledge theyr wharrowe,
Theyr rybskyn and theyr spyndell,
Theyr nedell and theyr thymbell:
Here was scant thryft
Whan they made suche shyft

Theyr thrust was so great,
They asked never for mete,
But drynke, styll drynke,
""And let the cat wynke,
Let us washe our gommes
From the drye crommes!""

But some than sat ryght sad
That nothynge had
There of theyre awne,
Neyther gelt nor pawne;
Suche were there menny
That had not a penny,
But, whan they should walke,
Were fayne wyth a chalke
To score on the balke,
Or score on the tayle:
God gyve it yll hayle!
For my fyngers ytche;
I have wrytten to mytche
Of this mad mummynge
Of Elynour Rummynge:
Thus endeth the gest
Of this worthy fest!

What can it avail
To drive forth a snail,
Or to make a sail
Of an herring’s tail;
To rhyme or to rail,
To write or to indict,
Either for delight
Or else for despight;
Or books to compile
Of divers manner of style,
Vice to revile
And sin to exile;
To teach or to preach,

He wotteth never what
Nor whereof he speaketh;
He crieth and he creaketh,
He prieth and he peeketh,
He chides and he chatters,
He prates and he patters,   
He clitters and he clatters,
He meddles and he smatters,
He gloses and he flatters;
Or if he speak plain,
Then he lacketh brain,
He is but a fool;
Let him go to school,
On a three footed stool
That he may down sit,
For he lacketh wit;
And if that he hit
The nail on the head,
It standeth in no stead;
The devil, they say, is dead,
The devil is dead.
    It may well so be,
Or else they would see
Otherwise, and flee
From worldly vanity,
And foul covetousness,
And other wretchedness,
Fickle falseness,
Variableness,
With unstableness.

Who brought this rhyme about,
My name is Colin Clout.

For the sowle of Philip Sparowe, 
That was late slayn at Carowe, 
Among the Nones Blake, 
For that swete soules sake, 
And for all sparowes soules, 
Set in our bederolles, 
Pater noster qui, 
With an Ave Mari,  
And with the corner of a Crede, 
The more shalbe your mede. 
 
Whan I remembre agayn 
How mi Philyp was slayn, 
Never halfe the payne 
Was betwene you twayne, 
Pyramus and Thesbe, 
As than befell to me: 
I wept and I wayled, 
The tearys downe hayled; 
But nothinge it avayled 
To call Phylyp agayne, 
Whom Gyb our cat hath slayne. 
 
Gib, I saye, our cat, 
Worrowyd her on that 
Which I loved best: 
It can not be exprest 
My sorowfull hevynesse, 
But all without redresse; 
For within that stounde, 
Halfe slumbrynge, in a swounde 
I fell downe to the grounde. 
 
Unneth I kest myne eyes 
Towarde the cloudy skyes: 
But whan I dyd beholde 
My sparow dead and colde, 
No creatuer but that wolde 
Have rewed upon me, 
To behold and se 
What hevynesse dyd me pange; 
Wherewith my handes I wrange, 
That my senaws cracked, 
As though I had ben racked, 
So payned and so strayned, 
That no lyfe wellnye remayned. 
 
I syghed and I sobbed, 
For that I was robbed 
Of my sparowes lyfe. 
O mayden, wydow, and wyfe, 
Of what estate ye be, 
Of hye or lowe degre, 
Great sorowe than ye myght se, 
And lerne to wepe at me! 
Such paynes dyd me frete, 
That myne hert dyd bete,

Wanne, and blewe as lead; 
The panges of hatefull death 
Wellnye had stopped my breath. 
Heu, heu, me,

Ad Dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi:  
Of God nothynge els crave I 
But Phyllypes soule to kepe 
From the marees deepe 
Of Acherontes well, 
That is a flode of hell; 
And from the great Pluto, 
The prynce of endles wo; 
And from foule Alecto, 
With vysage blacke and blo; 
And from Medusa, that mare, 
That lyke a fende doth stare; 
And from Megeras edders, 
For rufflynge of Phillips fethers, 
And from her fyry sparklynges, 
For burnynge of his wynges; 
And from the smokes sowre 
Of Proserpinas bowre; 
And from the dennes darke, 
Wher Cerberus doth barke, 
Whom Theseus dyd afraye, 
Whom Hercules dyd outraye, 
As famous poetes say; 
From that hell-hounde, 
That lyeth in cheynes bounde, 
With gastly hedes thre, 
To Jupyter pray we 
That Phyllyp preserved may be! 
Amen, say ye with me! 
 
Do mi nus,  
Helpe nowe, swete Jesus! 
Levavi oculos meos in montes:  
Wolde God I had Zenophontes, 
Or Socrates the wyse 
To shew me their devyse, 
Moderatly to take 
This sorrow that I make 
For Phylyp Sparowes sake! 
So fervently I shake, 
I fele my body quake; 
So urgently I am brought 
Into carefull thought.

Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
As on a stith, where some work of fame
Was daily wrought, to turn to Britain’s gain.

A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,
To live upright and smile at fortune’s choice.

A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)
Some may approach, but never none shall hit.

A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.

An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;
Whose piercing look did represent a mind
With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.

A heart where dread yet never so impressed
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;
In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.

A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,
Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,
Lived, and ran the race that nature set;
Of manhood’s shape, where she the mold did lose.

But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,
Which left with such, as covet Christ to know

Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

Then spake fair Venus’ son, that proud victorious boy,
Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

George Gascoigne,1535–1578,The Steel Glass,"(excerpt)

O knights, O squires, O gentle bloods yborn,
You were not born all only for yourselves:
Your country claims some part of all your pains.
There should you live, and therein should you toil
To hold up right and banish cruel wrong,
To help the poor, to bridle back the rich,
To punish vice, and virtue to advance,
To see God serv’d and Belzebub suppres’d.
You should not trust lieutenants in your room,
And let them sway the sceptre of your charge,
Whiles you, meanwhile, know scarcely what is done,
Nor yet can yield accompt if you were call’d.
The stately lord, which wonted was to keep
A court at home, is now come up to court,
And leaves the country for a common prey
To pilling, polling, bribing, and deceit
(All which his presence might have pacified,
Or else have made offenders smell the smoke).
And now the youth which might have served him
In comely wise, with country clothes yclad,
And yet thereby been able to prefer
Unto the prince, and there to seek advance,
Is fain to sell his lands for courtly clouts,
Or else sits still, and liveth like a lout
(Yet of these two the last fault is the less).
And so those imps which might in time have sprung
Aloft, good lord, and serv’d to shield the state,
Are either nipp’d with such untimely frosts,
Or else grow crook’d, because they be not proynd.

    ...

EPILOGUS

Alas, my lord, my haste was all too hot,
I shut my glass before you gaz’d your fill,
And, at a glimpse, my silly self have spied
A stranger troop than any yet were seen.
Behold, my lord, what monsters muster here,
With angel’s face, and harmful hellish hearts,
With smiling looks, and deep deceitful thoughts,
With tender skins, and stony cruel minds,
With stealing steps, yet forward feet to fraud.
Behold, behold, they never stand content,
With God, with kind, with any help of art,
But curl their locks with bodkins and with braids,
But dye their hair with sundry subtle sleights,
But paint and slick till fairest face be foul,
But bumbast, bolster, frizzle, and perfume.
They mar with musk the balm which nature made
And dig for death in delicatest dishes.
The younger sort come piping on apace,
In whistles made of fine enticing wood,
Till they have caught the birds for whom they birded.
The elder sort go stately stalking on,
And on their backs they bear both land and fee,
Castles and towers, revenues and receipts,
Lordships and manors, fines, yea, farms and all.
What should these be? Speak you, my lovely lord.
They be not men: for why? they have no beards.
They be no boys, which wear such side long gowns.
They be no gods, for all their gallant gloss.
They be no devils, I trow, which seem so saintish.
What be they? women? masking in men’s weeds?
With Dutchkin doublets, and with jerkins jagg’d?
With Spanish spangs, and ruffs fet out of France,
With high-copp’d hats, and feathers flaunt-a-flaunt?
They be so sure, even wo to men indeed.
Nay then, my lord, let shut the glass apace,
High time it were for my poor muse to wink,
Since all the hands, all paper, pen, and ink,
Which ever yet this wretched world possess’d
Cannot describe this sex in colours due!
No, no, my lord, we gazed have enough;
And I too much, God pardon me therefore.
Better look off, than look an ace too far;
And better mum, than meddle overmuch.
But if my glass do like my lovely lord,
We will espy, some sunny summer’s day,
To look again, and see some seemly sights.
Meanwhile, my Muse right humbly doth beseech,
That my good lord accept this vent’rous verse,
Until my brains may better stuff devise.",blank verse,meters,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44283/the-steel-glass,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/george-gascoigne,,1535.0,1578.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised;

Base thing I can no more endure to view;

Edmund Spenser,1552–1599,Prosopopoia: or Mother Hubbard's Tale,"By that he ended had his ghostly sermon, 
The fox was well induc'd to be a parson, 
And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire, 
How to a benefice he might aspire. 
""Marry, there"" (said the priest) ""is art indeed: 
Much good deep learning one thereout may read; 
For that the ground-work is, and end of all, 
How to obtain a beneficial. 
First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise 
Yourself attired, as you can devise, 
Then to some nobleman yourself apply, 
Or other great one in the worldes eye, 
That hath a zealous disposition 
To God, and so to his religion. 
There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal, 
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal; 
For each thing feigned ought more wary be. 
There thou must walk in sober gravity, 
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund: 
Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground, 
And unto every one do courtesy meek: 
These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek, 
But be thou sure one not to lack or long. 
And if thee list unto the court to throng, 
And there to hunt after the hoped prey, 
Then must thou thee dispose another way: 
For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie, 
To face, to forge, to scoff, to company, 
To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock 
Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock. 
So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice, 
Unless thou canst one conjure by device, 
Or cast a figure for a bishopric; 
And if one could, it were but a school trick. 
These be the ways by which without reward 
Livings in court be gotten, though full hard; 
For nothing there is done without a fee: 
The courtier needs must recompensed be 
With a benevolence, or have in gage 
The primitias of your parsonage: 
Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by, 
But that it must be gelt in privity. 
Do not thou therefore seek a living there, 
But of more private persons seek elsewhere, 
Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny, 
Ne let thy learning question'd be of any. 
For some good gentleman, that hath the right 
Unto his church for to present a wight, 
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise; 
That if the living yearly do arise 
To forty pound, that then his youngest son 
Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won: 
Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift, 
And he will care for all the rest to shift, 
Both that the bishop may admit of thee, 
And that therein thou may'st maintained be. 
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd 
Living to get, and not to be discern'd. 
But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways, 
For learning sake to living them to raise; 
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven 
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven. 
How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst 
Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)? 
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving. 
Needs any more to learn to get a living?"" 
 
""Now sure, and by my halidom,"" (quoth he) 
""Ye a great master are in your degree: 
Great thanks I yield you for your discipline, 
And do not doubt but duly to incline 
My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear."" 
The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare: 
So parted they, as either's way them led. 
But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped, 
Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught, 
And through their own fair handling wisely wrought, 
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained; 
And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained, 
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be. 
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee; 
But, ere long time had passed, they so ill 
Did order their affairs, that th' evil will 
Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd; 
Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd, 
How foully they their offices abus'd, 
And them of crimes and heresies accus'd, 
That pursuivants he often for them sent; 
But they neglected his commandement. 
So long persisted obstinate and bold, 
Till at the length he published to hold 
A visitation, and them cited thether: 
Then was high time their wits about to geather. 
What did they then, but made a composition 
With their next neighbour priest, for light condition, 
To whom their living they resigned quite

Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete? 
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne? 
 
Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare, 
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne? 
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares 
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.

He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare. 
 
Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare, 
Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment, 
He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare 
His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.

What is he for a Ladde, you so lament? 
Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove? 
And hath he skill to make so excellent, 
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?

Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye: 
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte. 
Whilome on him was all my care and joye, 
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart. 
 
But now from me hys madding mynd is starte, 
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne: 
So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart, 
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.

The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight, 
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone. 
 
HOBBINOLL 
Contented I: then will I singe his laye 
Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all: 
Which once he made, as by a spring he laye, 
And tuned it unto the Waters fall. 
 
Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke 
         doe bathe your brest, 
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke, 
         at my request: 
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell, 
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well, 
         Helpe me to blaze

         In princely plight. 
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte, 
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot: 
         So sprong her grace 
         Of heavenly race, 
No mortall blemishe may her blotte. 
 
See, where she sits upon the grassie greene, 
         (O seemely sight) 
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene, 
         And Ermines white. 
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet, 
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set: 
         Bayleaves betweene, 
         And Primroses greene 
Embellish the sweete Violet. 
 
Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face, 
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre? 
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace 
         can you well compare? 
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere, 
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere. 
         Her modest eye, 
         Her Majestie, 
Where have you seene the like, but there? 
 
I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde, 
         upon her to gaze: 
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde, 
         it did him amaze. 
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe, 
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe: 
         Let him, if he dare, 
         His brightnesse compare 
With hers, to have the overthrowe. 
 
Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes, 
         and be not abasht: 
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes, 
         O how art thou dasht? 
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede, 
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede. 
         Now she is a stone, 
         And makes dayly mone, 
Warning all other to take heede. 
 
Pan may be proud, that ever he begot 
         such a Bellibone, 
And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot 
         to beare such an one. 
Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam, 
To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb: 
         Shee is my goddesse plaine, 
         And I her shepherds swayne, 
Albee forswonck and forswatt I am. 
 
I see Calliope speede her to the place, 
         where my Goddesse shines: 
And after her the other Muses trace, 
         with their Violines. 
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare, 
All for Elisa in her hand to weare? 
         So sweetely they play, 
         And sing all the way, 
That it a heaven is to heare. 
 
Lo how finely the graces can it foote 
         to the Instrument: 
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote, 
         in their meriment. 
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even? 
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven: 
         She shalbe a grace, 
         To fyll the fourth place,

         With Gelliflowres: 
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine, 
         worne of Paramoures. 
Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies, 
And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies: 
         The pretie Pawnce,

Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song. 
         And if you come hether,

Edmund Spenser,1552–1599,from The Shepheardes Calender: October,"PIERCE       &         CUDDIE 
Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head, 
And let us cast with what delight to chace, 
And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race. 
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade, 
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base: 
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead. 
 
CUDDY 
Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne, 
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore: 
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store, 
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne, 
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore, 
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine. 
 
The dapper ditties, that I wont devise, 
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry, 
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy? 
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise. 
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye: 
What good thereof to Cuddie can arise? 
 
PIERS 
Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price, 
The glory eke much greater then the gayne: 
O what an honor is it, to restraine 
The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice: 
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine, 
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice. 
 
Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame, 
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave: 
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave, 
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame 
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave: 
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame. 
 
CUDDIE 
So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine, 
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye: 
But who rewards him ere the more for thy? 
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine? 
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye, 
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne. 
 
PIERS 
Abandon then the base and viler clowne, 
Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust: 
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts. 
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne, 
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts, 
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne. 
 
There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing, 
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West: 
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest, 
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing, 
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best, 
That first the white beare to the stake did bring. 
 
And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds, 
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string: 
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing, 
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde, 
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring. 
So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde. 
 
CUDDYE 
Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare, 
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede, 
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede, 
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare, 
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede, 
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here. 
 
But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye, 
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead: 
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade, 
That matter made for Poets on to play: 
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade, 
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye. 
 
But after vertue gan for age to stoupe, 
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease: 
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease, 
To put in preace emong the learned troupe. 
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease, 
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe. 
 
And if that any buddes of Poesie, 
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne: 
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne, 
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye: 
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne: 
Tom Piper makes us better melodie. 
 
PIERS 
O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place? 
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt: 
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt) 
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace. 
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit, 
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace. 
 
CUDDIE 
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne, 
So high to sore, and make so large a flight: 
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight, 
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne: 
He, were he not with love so ill bedight, 
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne. 
 
PIERS 
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie, 
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre: 
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire, 
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie. 
And cause a caytive corage to aspire, 
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye. 
 
CUDDIE 
All otherwise the state of Poet stands, 
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell: 
That where he rules, all power he doth expell. 
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes, 
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell. 
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand. 
 
Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise, 
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate: 
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate, 
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise. 
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate, 
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse. 
 
Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage. 
O if my temples were distaind with wine, 
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine, 
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage, 
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine, 
With queint Bellona in her equipage. 
 
But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme, 
For thy, content us in thys humble shade: 
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde, 
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme. 
 
PIERS 
And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd: 
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.

The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake.
His coward lips did from their color fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
“Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius”
As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Dramatic Monologue', 'Enemies', 'Jealousy', 'Politics', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/julius-caesar-act-i-scene-ii-i-know-virtue-be-you-brutus,https://poets.org/poet/william-shakespeare,2017,1564.0,1616.0,['Dramatic Monologue'],"['Enemies', 'Jealousy', 'Politics', 'Public Domain']",[],Academy of American Poets

William Shakespeare,1564 – 1616,The little love-god lying once asleep (Sonnet 154),"The little love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vow’d chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm’d;
And so the general of hot desire
What sleeping by a virgin hand disarm’d.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress’ thrall,
    Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
    Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Public Domain']","This poem is in the public domain.

Christopher Marlowe,1564–1593,Hero and Leander,"The First Sestiad 
 
(excerpt)

On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood, 
In view and opposite two cities stood, 
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might; 
The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight. 
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair, 
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair, 
And offer'd as a dower his burning throne, 
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon. 
The outside of her garments were of lawn, 
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn; 
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove, 
Where Venus in her naked glory strove 
To please the careless and disdainful eyes 
Of proud Adonis, that before her lies; 
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain, 
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain. 
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath, 
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath; 
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves, 
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives; 
Many would praise the sweet smell as she past, 
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast; 
And there for honey bees have sought in vain, 
And beat from thence, have lighted there again. 
About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone, 
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone. 
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind 
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind, 
Or warm or cool them, for they took delight 
To play upon those hands, they were so white. 
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she, 
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee; 
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold, 
Such as the world would wonder to behold: 
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills, 
Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills. 
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd, 
And looking in her face, was strooken blind. 
But this is true; so like was one the other, 
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother; 
And oftentimes into her bosom flew, 
About her naked neck his bare arms threw, 
And laid his childish head upon her breast, 
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest. 
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun, 
As Nature wept, thinking she was undone, 
Because she took more from her than she left, 
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft: 
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack, 
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black. 
 
         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young 
(Whose tragedy divine Musæus sung), 
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none 
For whom succeeding times make greater moan. 
His dangling tresses, that were never shorn, 
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne, 
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece 
To hazard more than for the golden fleece. 
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere; 
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there. 
His body was as straight as Circe's wand; 
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand. 
Even as delicious meat is to the taste, 
So was his neck in touching, and surpast 
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye, 
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly; 
And whose immortal fingers did imprint 
That heavenly path with many a curious dint 
That runs along his back; but my rude pen 
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men, 
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice 
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes; 
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his 
That leapt into the water for a kiss 
Of his own shadow, and, despising many, 
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any. 
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen, 
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been. 
His presence made the rudest peasant melt, 
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt; 
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought, 
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought. 
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire, 
For in his looks were all that men desire,— 
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye, 
A brow for love to banquet royally; 
And such as knew he was a man, would say, 
""Leander, thou art made for amorous play; 
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all? 
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall."" 
 
         The men of wealthy Sestos every year, 
For his sake whom their goddess held so dear, 
Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast. 
Thither resorted many a wandering guest 
To meet their loves; such as had none at all 
Came lovers home from this great festival; 
For every street, like to a firmament, 
Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went, 
Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd 
Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd 
As if another Pha{""e}ton had got 
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot. 
But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd, 
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind; 
For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony, 
So was her beauty to the standers-by; 
Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star 
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car 
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky, 
Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty, 
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood 
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood. 
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase, 
Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race, 
Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain 
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain, 
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her, 
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her. 
And as in fury of a dreadful fight, 
Their fellows being slain or put to flight, 
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken, 
So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken, 
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes; 
He whom she favours lives; the other dies. 
There might you see one sigh, another rage, 
And some, their violent passions to assuage, 
Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late, 
For faithful love will never turn to hate. 
And many, seeing great princes were denied, 
Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died. 
On this feast-day—O cursed day and hour!— 
Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower 
To Venus' temple, where unhappily, 
As after chanc'd, they did each other spy. 
So fair a church as this had Venus none: 
The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone, 
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head 
A lively vine of green sea-agate spread, 
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung, 
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung. 
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was; 
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass: 
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes, 
Committing heady riots, incest, rapes: 
For know, that underneath this radiant flower 
Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower, 
Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed, 
To dally with Idalian Ganimed, 
And for his love Europa bellowing loud, 
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud; 
Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net, 
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set; 
Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy, 
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy 
That now is turn'd into a cypress tree, 
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be. 
And in the midst a silver altar stood: 
There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood, 
Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close; 
And modestly they opened as she rose. 
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head; 
And thus Leander was enamoured. 
Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed, 
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed 
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook: 
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look. 
 
         It lies not in our power to love or hate, 
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate. 
When two are stript, long ere the course begin, 
We wish that one should lose, the other win; 
And one especially do we affect 
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect: 
The reason no man knows, let it suffice, 
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes. 
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:

Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
’Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.

Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,

Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.

Still she was first; still she my songs did end;

The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.

Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.

When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann’d,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care’s rash sudden storms being o’erspread,
My body’a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder’s blue stains scatter’d on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to’have lov’d a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
“Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus’d tastes seems tough.”",elegy,types/modes,"['Elegy', 'Memories', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain. ,https://poets.org/poem/elegy-v-his-picture,https://poets.org/poet/john-donne,2017,1572.0,1631.0,['Elegy'],"['Memories', 'Public Domain']",[],Academy of American Poets

John Donne,1572–1631,An Anatomy of the World,"(excerpt) 
 
AN ANATOMY OF THE WORLD 
Wherein, 
by occasion of the untimely death of Mistress 
Elizabeth Drury, the frailty and the decay 
of this whole world is represented 
THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY

When that rich soul which to her heaven is gone, 
Whom all do celebrate, who know they have one 
(For who is sure he hath a soul, unless 
It see, and judge, and follow worthiness, 
And by deeds praise it? He who doth not this, 
May lodge an inmate soul, but 'tis not his) 
When that queen ended here her progress time, 
And, as t'her standing house, to heaven did climb, 
Where loath to make the saints attend her long, 
She's now a part both of the choir, and song; 
This world, in that great earthquake languished; 
For in a common bath of tears it bled, 
Which drew the strongest vital spirits out; 
But succour'd then with a perplexed doubt, 
Whether the world did lose, or gain in this, 
(Because since now no other way there is, 
But goodness, to see her, whom all would see, 
All must endeavour to be good as she) 
This great consumption to a fever turn'd, 
And so the world had fits; it joy'd, it mourn'd; 
And, as men think, that agues physic are, 
And th' ague being spent, give over care, 
So thou, sick world, mistak'st thy self to be 
Well, when alas, thou'rt in a lethargy. 
Her death did wound and tame thee then, and then 
Thou might'st have better spar'd the sun, or man. 
That wound was deep, but 'tis more misery 
That thou hast lost thy sense and memory. 
'Twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan, 
But this is worse, that thou art speechless grown. 
Thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst; thou wast 
Nothing but she, and her thou hast o'erpast. 
For, as a child kept from the font until 
A prince, expected long, come to fulfill 
The ceremonies, thou unnam'd had'st laid, 
Had not her coming, thee her palace made; 
Her name defin'd thee, gave thee form, and frame, 
And thou forget'st to celebrate thy name. 
Some months she hath been dead (but being dead, 
Measures of times are all determined) 
But long she'ath been away, long, long, yet none 
Offers to tell us who it is that's gone. 
But as in states doubtful of future heirs, 
When sickness without remedy impairs 
The present prince, they're loath it should be said, 
""The prince doth languish,"" or ""The prince is dead;"" 
So mankind feeling now a general thaw, 
A strong example gone, equal to law, 
The cement which did faithfully compact 
And glue all virtues, now resolv'd, and slack'd, 
Thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead, 
Or that our weakness was discovered 
In that confession; therefore spoke no more 
Than tongues, the soul being gone, the loss deplore. 
But though it be too late to succour thee, 
Sick world, yea dead, yea putrified, since she 
Thy' intrinsic balm, and thy preservative, 
Can never be renew'd, thou never live, 
I (since no man can make thee live) will try, 
What we may gain by thy anatomy. 
Her death hath taught us dearly that thou art 
Corrupt and mortal in thy purest part. 
Let no man say, the world itself being dead, 
'Tis labour lost to have discovered 
The world's infirmities, since there is none 
Alive to study this dissection; 
For there's a kind of world remaining still, 
Though she which did inanimate and fill 
The world, be gone, yet in this last long night, 
Her ghost doth walk; that is a glimmering light, 
A faint weak love of virtue, and of good, 
Reflects from her on them which understood 
Her worth; and though she have shut in all day, 
The twilight of her memory doth stay, 
Which, from the carcass of the old world free, 
Creates a new world, and new creatures be 
Produc'd. The matter and the stuff of this, 
Her virtue, and the form our practice is. 
And though to be thus elemented, arm 
These creatures from home-born intrinsic harm, 
(For all assum'd unto this dignity 
So many weedless paradises be, 
Which of themselves produce no venomous sin, 
Except some foreign serpent bring it in) 
Yet, because outward storms the strongest break, 
And strength itself by confidence grows weak, 
This new world may be safer, being told 
The dangers and diseases of the old; 
For with due temper men do then forgo, 
Or covet things, when they their true worth know. 
There is no health; physicians say that we 
At best enjoy but a neutrality. 
And can there be worse sickness than to know 
That we are never well, nor can be so? 
We are born ruinous: poor mothers cry 
That children come not right, nor orderly; 
Except they headlong come and fall upon 
An ominous precipitation. 
How witty's ruin! how importunate 
Upon mankind! It labour'd to frustrate 
Even God's purpose; and made woman, sent 
For man's relief, cause of his languishment. 
They were to good ends, and they are so still, 
But accessory, and principal in ill, 
For that first marriage was our funeral; 
One woman at one blow, then kill'd us all, 
And singly, one by one, they kill us now. 
We do delightfully our selves allow 
To that consumption; and profusely blind, 
We kill our selves to propagate our kind. 
And yet we do not that; we are not men; 
There is not now that mankind, which was then, 
When as the sun and man did seem to strive, 
(Joint tenants of the world) who should survive; 
When stag, and raven, and the long-liv'd tree, 
Compar'd with man, died in minority; 
When, if a slow-pac'd star had stol'n away 
From the observer's marking, he might stay 
Two or three hundred years to see't again, 
And then make up his observation plain; 
When, as the age was long, the size was great 
(Man's growth confess'd, and recompens'd the meat), 
So spacious and large, that every soul 
Did a fair kingdom, and large realm control; 
And when the very stature, thus erect, 
Did that soul a good way towards heaven direct. 
Where is this mankind now? Who lives to age, 
Fit to be made Methusalem his page? 
Alas, we scarce live long enough to try 
Whether a true-made clock run right, or lie. 
Old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow, 
And for our children we reserve tomorrow. 
So short is life, that every peasant strives, 
In a torn house, or field, to have three lives. 
And as in lasting, so in length is man 
Contracted to an inch, who was a span; 
For had a man at first in forests stray'd, 
Or shipwrack'd in the sea, one would have laid 
A wager, that an elephant, or whale, 
That met him, would not hastily assail 
A thing so equall to him; now alas, 
The fairies, and the pigmies well may pass 
As credible; mankind decays so soon, 
We'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon, 
Only death adds t'our length: nor are we grown 
In stature to be men, till we are none. 
But this were light, did our less volume hold 
All the old text; or had we chang'd to gold 
Their silver; or dispos'd into less glass 
Spirits of virtue, which then scatter'd was. 
But 'tis not so; w'are not retir'd, but damp'd; 
And as our bodies, so our minds are cramp'd; 
'Tis shrinking, not close weaving, that hath thus 
In mind and body both bedwarfed us. 
We seem ambitious, God's whole work t'undo; 
Of nothing he made us, and we strive too, 
To bring our selves to nothing back; and we 
Do what we can, to do't so soon as he. 
With new diseases on our selves we war, 
And with new physic, a worse engine far. 
Thus man, this world's vice-emperor, in whom 
All faculties, all graces are at home 
(And if in other creatures they appear, 
They're but man's ministers and legates there 
To work on their rebellions, and reduce 
Them to civility, and to man's use); 
This man, whom God did woo, and loath t'attend 
Till man came up, did down to man descend, 
This man, so great, that all that is, is his, 
O what a trifle, and poor thing he is! 
If man were anything, he's nothing now; 
Help, or at least some time to waste, allow 
T'his other wants, yet when he did depart 
With her whom we lament, he lost his heart. 
She, of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy, 
When they call'd virtues by the name of she; 
She in whom virtue was so much refin'd, 
That for alloy unto so pure a mind 
She took the weaker sex; she that could drive 
The poisonous tincture, and the stain of Eve, 
Out of her thoughts, and deeds, and purify 
All, by a true religious alchemy, 
She, she is dead; she's dead: when thou knowest this, 
Thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is, 
And learn'st thus much by our anatomy, 
The heart being perish'd, no part can be free, 
And that except thou feed (not banquet) on 
The supernatural food, religion, 
Thy better growth grows withered, and scant; 
Be more than man, or thou'rt less than an ant. 
Then, as mankind, so is the world's whole frame 
Quite out of joint, almost created lame, 
For, before God had made up all the rest, 
Corruption ent'red, and deprav'd the best; 
It seiz'd the angels, and then first of all 
The world did in her cradle take a fall, 
And turn'd her brains, and took a general maim, 
Wronging each joint of th'universal frame. 
The noblest part, man, felt it first; and then 
Both beasts and plants, curs'd in the curse of man. 
So did the world from the first hour decay, 
That evening was beginning of the day, 
And now the springs and summers which we see, 
Like sons of women after fifty be. 
And new philosophy calls all in doubt, 
The element of fire is quite put out, 
The sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit 
Can well direct him where to look for it. 
And freely men confess that this world's spent, 
When in the planets and the firmament 
They seek so many new; they see that this 
Is crumbled out again to his atomies. 
'Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone, 
All just supply, and all relation; 
Prince, subject, father, son, are things forgot, 
For every man alone thinks he hath got 
To be a phoenix, and that then can be 
None of that kind, of which he is, but he. 
This is the world's condition now, and now 
She that should all parts to reunion bow, 
She that had all magnetic force alone, 
To draw, and fasten sund'red parts in one; 
She whom wise nature had invented then 
When she observ'd that every sort of men 
Did in their voyage in this world's sea stray, 
And needed a new compass for their way; 
She that was best and first original 
Of all fair copies, and the general 
Steward to fate; she whose rich eyes and breast 
Gilt the West Indies, and perfum'd the East; 
Whose having breath'd in this world, did bestow 
Spice on those Isles, and bade them still smell so, 
And that rich India which doth gold inter, 
Is but as single money, coin'd from her; 
She to whom this world must it self refer, 
As suburbs or the microcosm of her, 
She, she is dead; she's dead: when thou know'st this, 
Thou know'st how lame a cripple this world is",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Allusion']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44092/an-anatomy-of-the-world,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Donne,1572–1631,Of the Progress of the Soul: The Second Anniversary,"(excerpt) 
 
OF THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUL 
Wherein, 
by occasion of the religious death of Mistress 
Elizabeth Drury, the incommodities of the soul in this her life, and her 
exaltation in the next, are contemplated 
THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY

Forget this rotten world, and unto thee 
Let thine own times as an old story be. 
Be not concern'd; study not why, nor when; 
Do not so much as not believe a man. 
For though to err, be worst, to try truths forth 
Is far more business than this world is worth. 
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed 
By it, but as a worm, that carcass bred; 
And why shouldst thou, poor worm, consider more, 
When this world will grow better than before, 
Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon 
That carcass's last resurrection? 
Forget this world, and scarce think of it so, 
As of old clothes, cast off a year ago. 
To be thus stupid is alacrity; 
Men thus lethargic have best memory. 
Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state 
We now lament not, but congratulate. 
She, to whom all this world was but a stage, 
Where all sat heark'ning how her youthful age 
Should be employ'd, because in all she did 
Some figure of the golden times was hid. 
Who could not lack, what'er this world could give, 
Because she was the form, that made it live; 
Nor could complain that this world was unfit 
To be stay'd in, then when she was in it; 
She, that first tried indifferent desires 
By virtue, and virtue by religious fires; 
She, to whose person paradise adher'd, 
As courts to princes; she, whose eyes enspher'd 
Star-light enough t' have made the South control, 
(Had she been there) the star-full Northern Pole; 
She, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this, 
What fragmentary rubbish this world is 
Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought; 
He honours it too much that thinks it nought. 
Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom, 
Which brings a taper to the outward room, 
Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light, 
And after brings it nearer to thy sight; 
For such approaches doth heaven make in death. 
Think thyself labouring now with broken breath, 
And think those broken and soft notes to be 
Division, and thy happiest harmony. 
Think thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slack, 
And think that but unbinding of a pack, 
To take one precious thing, thy soul, from thence. 
Think thyself parch'd with fever's violence; 
Anger thine ague more, by calling it 
Thy physic; chide the slackness of the fit. 
Think that thou hear'st thy knell, and think no more, 
But that, as bells call'd thee to church before, 
So this to the Triumphant Church calls thee. 
Think Satan's sergeants round about thee be, 
And think that but for legacies they thrust; 
Give one thy pride, to'another give thy lust; 
Give them those sins which they gave thee before, 
And trust th' immaculate blood to wash thy score. 
Think thy friends weeping round, and think that they 
Weep but because they go not yet thy way. 
Think that they close thine eyes, and think in this, 
That they confess much in the world amiss, 
Who dare not trust a dead man's eye with that 
Which they from God and angels cover not. 
Think that they shroud thee up, and think from thence 
They reinvest thee in white innocence. 
Think that thy body rots, and (if so low, 
Thy soul exalted so, thy thoughts can go) 
Think thee a prince, who of themselves create 
Worms, which insensibly devour their state. 
Think that they bury thee, and think that rite 
Lays thee to sleep but a Saint Lucy's night.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Growing Old', 'Health & Illness', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'The Body', 'Time & Brevity', 'Nature', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Allusion', 'Metaphor', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44123/of-the-progress-of-the-soul-the-second-anniversary,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

And we will some new pleasures prove 
Of golden sands, and crystal brooks, 
With silken lines, and silver hooks. 
 
There will the river whispering run 
Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun; 
And there the 'enamour'd fish will stay, 
Begging themselves they may betray. 
 
When thou wilt swim in that live bath, 
Each fish, which every channel hath, 
Will amorously to thee swim, 
Gladder to catch thee, than thou him. 
 
If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth, 
By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both, 
And if myself have leave to see, 
I need not their light having thee. 
 
Let others freeze with angling reeds, 
And cut their legs with shells and weeds, 
Or treacherously poor fish beset, 
With strangling snare, or windowy net. 
 
Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest 
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest; 
Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies, 
Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes. 
 
For thee, thou need'st no such deceit, 
For thou thyself art thine own bait: 
That fish, that is not catch'd thereby, 
Alas, is wiser far than I.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'Classic Love', 'Desire', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet', 'Alliteration', 'Metaphor', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44094/the-bait-56d2230bf176d,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Donne,1572–1631,The Calm,"Our storm is past, and that storm's tyrannous rage, 
A stupid calm, but nothing it, doth 'suage. 
The fable is inverted, and far more 
A block afflicts, now, than a stork before. 
Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or us; 
In calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus. 
As steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were, 
Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there, 
The sea is now; and, as the isles which we 
Seek, when we can move, our ships rooted be. 
As water did in storms, now pitch runs out; 
As lead, when a fir'd church becomes one spout. 
And all our beauty, and our trim, decays, 
Like courts removing, or like ended plays. 
The fighting-place now seamen's rags supply; 
And all the tackling is a frippery. 
No use of lanthorns; and in one place lay 
Feathers and dust, to-day and yesterday. 
Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are, 
Have no more wind than the upper vault of air. 
We can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover, 
But meteor-like, save that we move not, hover. 
Only the calenture together draws 
Dear friends, which meet dead in great fishes' jaws; 
And on the hatches, as on altars, lies 
Each one, his own priest, and own sacrifice. 
Who live, that miracle do multiply, 
Where walkers in hot ovens do not die. 
If in despite of these we swim, that hath 
No more refreshing than our brimstone bath; 
But from the sea into the ship we turn, 
Like parboil'd wretches, on the coals to burn. 
Like Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' scoff, 
Or like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair off, 
Languish our ships. Now as a myriad 
Of ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake invade, 
The crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny chips, 
Might brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid ships. 
Whether a rotten state, and hope of gain, 
Or to disuse me from the queasy pain 
Of being belov'd and loving, or the thirst 
Of honour, or fair death, out-push'd me first, 
I lose my end; for here, as well as I, 
A desperate may live, and a coward die. 
Stag, dog, and all which from or towards flies, 
Is paid with life or prey, or doing dies. 
Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay 
A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray. 
He that at sea prays for more wind, as well 
Under the poles may beg cold, heat in hell. 
What are we then? How little more, alas, 
Is man now, than before he was? He was 
Nothing; for us, we are for nothing fit; 
Chance, or ourselves, still disproportion it. 
We have no power, no will, no sense; I lie, 
I should not then thus feel this misery.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Couplet', 'Allusion', 'Metaphor', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44096/the-calm,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Donne,1572–1631,The Canonization,"For God’s sake hold your tongue, and let me love,
         Or chide my palsy, or my gout,
My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,
         With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve,
                Take you a course, get you a place,
                Observe his honor, or his grace,
Or the king's real, or his stampèd face
         Contemplate; what you will, approve,
         So you will let me love.

Alas, alas, who’s injured by my love?
         What merchant’s ships have my sighs drowned?
Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?
         When did my colds a forward spring remove?
                When did the heats which my veins fill
                Add one more to the plaguy bill?
Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still
         Litigious men, which quarrels move,
         Though she and I do love.

Call us what you will, we are made such by love;
         Call her one, me another fly,
We're tapers too, and at our own cost die,
         And we in us find the eagle and the dove.
                The phoenix riddle hath more wit
                By us; we two being one, are it.
So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.
         We die and rise the same, and prove
         Mysterious by this love.

We can die by it, if not live by love,
         And if unfit for tombs and hearse
Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;
         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,
                We’ll build in sonnets pretty rooms;
                As well a well-wrought urn becomes
The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,
         And by these hymns, all shall approve
         Us canonized for Love.

And thus invoke us: “You, whom reverend love
         Made one another’s hermitage;
You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;
         Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove
                Into the glasses of your eyes
                (So made such mirrors, and such spies,
That they did all to you epitomize)
         Countries, towns, courts: beg from above
         A pattern of your love!”",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Love', 'Classic Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Couplet', 'Metaphor', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44097/the-canonization,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell. 
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more 
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before. 
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand 
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,

Was but the milk which in love's childish state 
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough 
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.""",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'The Body', 'Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44100/elegy-v-his-picture,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Donne,1572–1631,Elegy IX: The Autumnal,"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace 
         As I have seen in one autumnal face. 
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape, 
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape. 
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame; 
         Affection here takes reverence's name. 
Were her first years the golden age? That's true, 
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new. 
That was her torrid and inflaming time, 
         This is her tolerable tropic clime. 
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence, 
         He in a fever wishes pestilence. 
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were, 
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where. 
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit 
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit; 
And here till hers, which must be his death, come, 
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb. 
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere 
         In progress, yet his standing house is here: 
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night, 
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight. 
In all her words, unto all hearers fit, 
         You may at revels, you at council, sit. 
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood; 
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood, 
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste 
         And appetite to other things is past. 
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree, 
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she, 
Or else because, being young, nature did bless 
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness. 
If we love things long sought, age is a thing 
         Which we are fifty years in compassing; 
If transitory things, which soon decay, 
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day. 
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack, 
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack; 
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade; 
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made; 
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone, 
         To vex their souls at resurrection: 
Name not these living death's-heads unto me, 
         For these, not ancient, but antique be. 
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay 
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day. 
Since such love's natural lation is, may still 
         My love descend, and journey down the hill, 
Not panting after growing beauties. So, 
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Growing Old', 'The Body', 'Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Nature', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44101/elegy-ix-the-autumnal,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

The intelligence that moves, devotion is, 
And as the other Spheares, by being growne 
Subject to forraigne motion, lose their owne, 
And being by others hurried every day, 
Scarce in a yeare their naturall forme obey: 
Pleasure or businesse, so, our Soules admit 
For their first mover, and are whirld by it. 
Hence is't, that I am carryed towards the West 
This day, when my Soules forme bends toward the East. 
There I should see a Sunne, by rising set, 
And by that setting endlesse day beget; 
But that Christ on this Crosse, did rise and fall, 
Sinne had eternally benighted all. 
Yet dare I'almost be glad, I do not see 
That spectacle of too much weight for mee. 
Who sees Gods face, that is selfe life, must dye; 
What a death were it then to see God dye? 
It made his owne Lieutenant Nature shrinke, 
It made his footstoole crack, and the Sunne winke. 
Could I behold those hands which span the Poles, 
And tune all spheares at once peirc'd with those holes? 
Could I behold that endlesse height which is 
Zenith to us, and our Antipodes, 
Humbled below us? or that blood which is 
The seat of all our Soules, if not of his, 
Made durt of dust, or that flesh which was worne 
By God, for his apparell, rag'd, and torne? 
If on these things I durst not looke, durst I 
Upon his miserable mother cast mine eye, 
Who was Gods partner here, and furnish'd thus 
Halfe of that Sacrifice, which ransom'd us? 
Though these things, as I ride, be from mine eye, 
They'are present yet unto my memory, 
For that looks towards them; and thou look'st towards mee, 
O Saviour, as thou hang'st upon the tree; 
I turne my backe to thee, but to receive 
Corrections, till thy mercies bid thee leave. 
O thinke mee worth thine anger, punish mee,

Can be as happy'as I can, if he can 
Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?

       Some second guest to entertain, 
       (For graves have learn'd that woman head, 
       To be to more than one a bed) 
                And he that digs it, spies 
A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,

All women shall adore us, and some men; 
And since at such time miracles are sought, 
I would have that age by this paper taught 
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought. 
 
         First, we lov'd well and faithfully, 
         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why; 
         Difference of sex no more we knew

                Coming and going, we 
Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals; 
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals

John Donne,1572–1631,Satire III,"Kind pity chokes my spleen; brave scorn forbids 
Those tears to issue which swell my eyelids; 
I must not laugh, nor weep sins and be wise; 
Can railing, then, cure these worn maladies? 
Is not our mistress, fair Religion, 
As worthy of all our souls' devotion 
As virtue was in the first blinded age? 
Are not heaven's joys as valiant to assuage 
Lusts, as earth's honour was to them? Alas, 
As we do them in means, shall they surpass 
Us in the end? and shall thy father's spirit 
Meet blind philosophers in heaven, whose merit 
Of strict life may be imputed faith, and hear 
Thee, whom he taught so easy ways and near 
To follow, damn'd? Oh, if thou dar'st, fear this; 
This fear great courage and high valour is. 
Dar'st thou aid mutinous Dutch, and dar'st thou lay 
Thee in ships' wooden sepulchres, a prey 
To leaders' rage, to storms, to shot, to dearth? 
Dar'st thou dive seas, and dungeons of the earth? 
Hast thou courageous fire to thaw the ice 
Of frozen North discoveries? and thrice 
Colder than salamanders, like divine 
Children in th' oven, fires of Spain and the Line, 
Whose countries limbecs to our bodies be, 
Canst thou for gain bear? and must every he 
Which cries not, ""Goddess,"" to thy mistress, draw 
Or eat thy poisonous words? Courage of straw! 
O desperate coward, wilt thou seem bold, and 
To thy foes and his, who made thee to stand 
Sentinel in his world's garrison, thus yield, 
And for forbidden wars leave th' appointed field? 
Know thy foes: the foul devil, whom thou 
Strivest to please, for hate, not love, would allow 
Thee fain his whole realm to be quit; and as 
The world's all parts wither away and pass, 
So the world's self, thy other lov'd foe, is 
In her decrepit wane, and thou loving this, 
Dost love a wither'd and worn strumpet; last, 
Flesh (itself's death) and joys which flesh can taste, 
Thou lovest, and thy fair goodly soul, which doth 
Give this flesh power to taste joy, thou dost loathe. 
Seek true religion. O where? Mirreus, 
Thinking her unhous'd here, and fled from us, 
Seeks her at Rome; there, because he doth know 
That she was there a thousand years ago, 
He loves her rags so, as we here obey 
The statecloth where the prince sate yesterday. 
Crantz to such brave loves will not be enthrall'd, 
But loves her only, who at Geneva is call'd 
Religion, plain, simple, sullen, young, 
Contemptuous, yet unhandsome; as among 
Lecherous humours, there is one that judges 
No wenches wholesome, but coarse country drudges. 
Graius stays still at home here, and because 
Some preachers, vile ambitious bawds, and laws, 
Still new like fashions, bid him think that she 
Which dwells with us is only perfect, he 
Embraceth her whom his godfathers will 
Tender to him, being tender, as wards still 
Take such wives as their guardians offer, or 
Pay values. Careless Phrygius doth abhor 
All, because all cannot be good, as one 
Knowing some women whores, dares marry none. 
Graccus loves all as one, and thinks that so 
As women do in divers countries go 
In divers habits, yet are still one kind, 
So doth, so is Religion; and this blind- 
ness too much light breeds; but unmoved, thou 
Of force must one, and forc'd, but one allow, 
And the right; ask thy father which is she, 
Let him ask his; though truth and falsehood be 
Near twins, yet truth a little elder is; 
Be busy to seek her; believe me this, 
He's not of none, nor worst, that seeks the best. 
To adore, or scorn an image, or protest, 
May all be bad; doubt wisely; in strange way 
To stand inquiring right, is not to stray; 
To sleep, or run wrong, is. On a huge hill, 
Cragged and steep, Truth stands, and he that will 
Reach her, about must and about must go, 
And what the hill's suddenness resists, win so. 
Yet strive so that before age, death's twilight, 
Thy soul rest, for none can work in that night. 
To will implies delay, therefore now do; 
Hard deeds, the body's pains; hard knowledge too 
The mind's endeavours reach, and mysteries 
Are like the sun, dazzling, yet plain to all eyes. 
Keep the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand 
In so ill case, that God hath with his hand 
Sign'd kings' blank charters to kill whom they hate; 
Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to fate. 
Fool and wretch, wilt thou let thy soul be tied 
To man's laws, by which she shall not be tried 
At the last day? Oh, will it then boot thee 
To say a Philip, or a Gregory, 
A Harry, or a Martin, taught thee this? 
Is not this excuse for mere contraries 
Equally strong? Cannot both sides say so? 
That thou mayest rightly obey power, her bounds know; 
Those past, her nature and name is chang'd; to be 
Then humble to her is idolatry. 
As streams are, power is; those blest flowers that dwell 
At the rough stream's calm head, thrive and do well, 
But having left their roots, and themselves given 
To the stream's tyrannous rage, alas, are driven 
Through mills, and rocks, and woods, and at last, almost 
Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost. 
So perish souls, which more choose men's unjust 
Power from God claim'd, than God himself to trust.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44125/satire-iii,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

A lecture, love, in love's philosophy. 
         These three hours that we have spent, 
         Walking here, two shadows went 
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd. 
But, now the sun is just above our head, 
         We do those shadows tread, 
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd. 
So whilst our infant loves did grow, 
Disguises did, and shadows, flow 
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so. 
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree, 
Which is still diligent lest others see. 
 
Except our loves at this noon stay, 
We shall new shadows make the other way. 
         As the first were made to blind 
         Others, these which come behind 
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes. 
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline, 
         To me thou, falsely, thine, 
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise. 
The morning shadows wear away, 
But these grow longer all the day; 
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.

John Donne,1572–1631,An Anatomy of the World,"(excerpt) 
 
AN ANATOMY OF THE WORLD 
Wherein, 
by occasion of the untimely death of Mistress 
Elizabeth Drury, the frailty and the decay 
of this whole world is represented 
THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY

When that rich soul which to her heaven is gone, 
Whom all do celebrate, who know they have one 
(For who is sure he hath a soul, unless 
It see, and judge, and follow worthiness, 
And by deeds praise it? He who doth not this, 
May lodge an inmate soul, but 'tis not his) 
When that queen ended here her progress time, 
And, as t'her standing house, to heaven did climb, 
Where loath to make the saints attend her long, 
She's now a part both of the choir, and song; 
This world, in that great earthquake languished; 
For in a common bath of tears it bled, 
Which drew the strongest vital spirits out; 
But succour'd then with a perplexed doubt, 
Whether the world did lose, or gain in this, 
(Because since now no other way there is, 
But goodness, to see her, whom all would see, 
All must endeavour to be good as she) 
This great consumption to a fever turn'd, 
And so the world had fits; it joy'd, it mourn'd; 
And, as men think, that agues physic are, 
And th' ague being spent, give over care, 
So thou, sick world, mistak'st thy self to be 
Well, when alas, thou'rt in a lethargy. 
Her death did wound and tame thee then, and then 
Thou might'st have better spar'd the sun, or man. 
That wound was deep, but 'tis more misery 
That thou hast lost thy sense and memory. 
'Twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan, 
But this is worse, that thou art speechless grown. 
Thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst; thou wast 
Nothing but she, and her thou hast o'erpast. 
For, as a child kept from the font until 
A prince, expected long, come to fulfill 
The ceremonies, thou unnam'd had'st laid, 
Had not her coming, thee her palace made; 
Her name defin'd thee, gave thee form, and frame, 
And thou forget'st to celebrate thy name. 
Some months she hath been dead (but being dead, 
Measures of times are all determined) 
But long she'ath been away, long, long, yet none 
Offers to tell us who it is that's gone. 
But as in states doubtful of future heirs, 
When sickness without remedy impairs 
The present prince, they're loath it should be said, 
""The prince doth languish,"" or ""The prince is dead;"" 
So mankind feeling now a general thaw, 
A strong example gone, equal to law, 
The cement which did faithfully compact 
And glue all virtues, now resolv'd, and slack'd, 
Thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead, 
Or that our weakness was discovered 
In that confession; therefore spoke no more 
Than tongues, the soul being gone, the loss deplore. 
But though it be too late to succour thee, 
Sick world, yea dead, yea putrified, since she 
Thy' intrinsic balm, and thy preservative, 
Can never be renew'd, thou never live, 
I (since no man can make thee live) will try, 
What we may gain by thy anatomy. 
Her death hath taught us dearly that thou art 
Corrupt and mortal in thy purest part. 
Let no man say, the world itself being dead, 
'Tis labour lost to have discovered 
The world's infirmities, since there is none 
Alive to study this dissection; 
For there's a kind of world remaining still, 
Though she which did inanimate and fill 
The world, be gone, yet in this last long night, 
Her ghost doth walk; that is a glimmering light, 
A faint weak love of virtue, and of good, 
Reflects from her on them which understood 
Her worth; and though she have shut in all day, 
The twilight of her memory doth stay, 
Which, from the carcass of the old world free, 
Creates a new world, and new creatures be 
Produc'd. The matter and the stuff of this, 
Her virtue, and the form our practice is. 
And though to be thus elemented, arm 
These creatures from home-born intrinsic harm, 
(For all assum'd unto this dignity 
So many weedless paradises be, 
Which of themselves produce no venomous sin, 
Except some foreign serpent bring it in) 
Yet, because outward storms the strongest break, 
And strength itself by confidence grows weak, 
This new world may be safer, being told 
The dangers and diseases of the old; 
For with due temper men do then forgo, 
Or covet things, when they their true worth know. 
There is no health; physicians say that we 
At best enjoy but a neutrality. 
And can there be worse sickness than to know 
That we are never well, nor can be so? 
We are born ruinous: poor mothers cry 
That children come not right, nor orderly; 
Except they headlong come and fall upon 
An ominous precipitation. 
How witty's ruin! how importunate 
Upon mankind! It labour'd to frustrate 
Even God's purpose; and made woman, sent 
For man's relief, cause of his languishment. 
They were to good ends, and they are so still, 
But accessory, and principal in ill, 
For that first marriage was our funeral; 
One woman at one blow, then kill'd us all, 
And singly, one by one, they kill us now. 
We do delightfully our selves allow 
To that consumption; and profusely blind, 
We kill our selves to propagate our kind. 
And yet we do not that; we are not men; 
There is not now that mankind, which was then, 
When as the sun and man did seem to strive, 
(Joint tenants of the world) who should survive; 
When stag, and raven, and the long-liv'd tree, 
Compar'd with man, died in minority; 
When, if a slow-pac'd star had stol'n away 
From the observer's marking, he might stay 
Two or three hundred years to see't again, 
And then make up his observation plain; 
When, as the age was long, the size was great 
(Man's growth confess'd, and recompens'd the meat), 
So spacious and large, that every soul 
Did a fair kingdom, and large realm control; 
And when the very stature, thus erect, 
Did that soul a good way towards heaven direct. 
Where is this mankind now? Who lives to age, 
Fit to be made Methusalem his page? 
Alas, we scarce live long enough to try 
Whether a true-made clock run right, or lie. 
Old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow, 
And for our children we reserve tomorrow. 
So short is life, that every peasant strives, 
In a torn house, or field, to have three lives. 
And as in lasting, so in length is man 
Contracted to an inch, who was a span; 
For had a man at first in forests stray'd, 
Or shipwrack'd in the sea, one would have laid 
A wager, that an elephant, or whale, 
That met him, would not hastily assail 
A thing so equall to him; now alas, 
The fairies, and the pigmies well may pass 
As credible; mankind decays so soon, 
We'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon, 
Only death adds t'our length: nor are we grown 
In stature to be men, till we are none. 
But this were light, did our less volume hold 
All the old text; or had we chang'd to gold 
Their silver; or dispos'd into less glass 
Spirits of virtue, which then scatter'd was. 
But 'tis not so; w'are not retir'd, but damp'd; 
And as our bodies, so our minds are cramp'd; 
'Tis shrinking, not close weaving, that hath thus 
In mind and body both bedwarfed us. 
We seem ambitious, God's whole work t'undo; 
Of nothing he made us, and we strive too, 
To bring our selves to nothing back; and we 
Do what we can, to do't so soon as he. 
With new diseases on our selves we war, 
And with new physic, a worse engine far. 
Thus man, this world's vice-emperor, in whom 
All faculties, all graces are at home 
(And if in other creatures they appear, 
They're but man's ministers and legates there 
To work on their rebellions, and reduce 
Them to civility, and to man's use); 
This man, whom God did woo, and loath t'attend 
Till man came up, did down to man descend, 
This man, so great, that all that is, is his, 
O what a trifle, and poor thing he is! 
If man were anything, he's nothing now; 
Help, or at least some time to waste, allow 
T'his other wants, yet when he did depart 
With her whom we lament, he lost his heart. 
She, of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy, 
When they call'd virtues by the name of she; 
She in whom virtue was so much refin'd, 
That for alloy unto so pure a mind 
She took the weaker sex; she that could drive 
The poisonous tincture, and the stain of Eve, 
Out of her thoughts, and deeds, and purify 
All, by a true religious alchemy, 
She, she is dead; she's dead: when thou knowest this, 
Thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is, 
And learn'st thus much by our anatomy, 
The heart being perish'd, no part can be free, 
And that except thou feed (not banquet) on 
The supernatural food, religion, 
Thy better growth grows withered, and scant; 
Be more than man, or thou'rt less than an ant. 
Then, as mankind, so is the world's whole frame 
Quite out of joint, almost created lame, 
For, before God had made up all the rest, 
Corruption ent'red, and deprav'd the best; 
It seiz'd the angels, and then first of all 
The world did in her cradle take a fall, 
And turn'd her brains, and took a general maim, 
Wronging each joint of th'universal frame. 
The noblest part, man, felt it first; and then 
Both beasts and plants, curs'd in the curse of man. 
So did the world from the first hour decay, 
That evening was beginning of the day, 
And now the springs and summers which we see, 
Like sons of women after fifty be. 
And new philosophy calls all in doubt, 
The element of fire is quite put out, 
The sun is lost, and th'earth, and no man's wit 
Can well direct him where to look for it. 
And freely men confess that this world's spent, 
When in the planets and the firmament 
They seek so many new; they see that this 
Is crumbled out again to his atomies. 
'Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone, 
All just supply, and all relation; 
Prince, subject, father, son, are things forgot, 
For every man alone thinks he hath got 
To be a phoenix, and that then can be 
None of that kind, of which he is, but he. 
This is the world's condition now, and now 
She that should all parts to reunion bow, 
She that had all magnetic force alone, 
To draw, and fasten sund'red parts in one; 
She whom wise nature had invented then 
When she observ'd that every sort of men 
Did in their voyage in this world's sea stray, 
And needed a new compass for their way; 
She that was best and first original 
Of all fair copies, and the general 
Steward to fate; she whose rich eyes and breast 
Gilt the West Indies, and perfum'd the East; 
Whose having breath'd in this world, did bestow 
Spice on those Isles, and bade them still smell so, 
And that rich India which doth gold inter, 
Is but as single money, coin'd from her; 
She to whom this world must it self refer, 
As suburbs or the microcosm of her, 
She, she is dead; she's dead: when thou know'st this, 
Thou know'st how lame a cripple this world is",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Allusion']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44092/an-anatomy-of-the-world,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Donne,1572–1631,Of the Progress of the Soul: The Second Anniversary,"(excerpt) 
 
OF THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUL 
Wherein, 
by occasion of the religious death of Mistress 
Elizabeth Drury, the incommodities of the soul in this her life, and her 
exaltation in the next, are contemplated 
THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY

Forget this rotten world, and unto thee 
Let thine own times as an old story be. 
Be not concern'd; study not why, nor when; 
Do not so much as not believe a man. 
For though to err, be worst, to try truths forth 
Is far more business than this world is worth. 
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed 
By it, but as a worm, that carcass bred; 
And why shouldst thou, poor worm, consider more, 
When this world will grow better than before, 
Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon 
That carcass's last resurrection? 
Forget this world, and scarce think of it so, 
As of old clothes, cast off a year ago. 
To be thus stupid is alacrity; 
Men thus lethargic have best memory. 
Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state 
We now lament not, but congratulate. 
She, to whom all this world was but a stage, 
Where all sat heark'ning how her youthful age 
Should be employ'd, because in all she did 
Some figure of the golden times was hid. 
Who could not lack, what'er this world could give, 
Because she was the form, that made it live; 
Nor could complain that this world was unfit 
To be stay'd in, then when she was in it; 
She, that first tried indifferent desires 
By virtue, and virtue by religious fires; 
She, to whose person paradise adher'd, 
As courts to princes; she, whose eyes enspher'd 
Star-light enough t' have made the South control, 
(Had she been there) the star-full Northern Pole; 
She, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this, 
What fragmentary rubbish this world is 
Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought; 
He honours it too much that thinks it nought. 
Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom, 
Which brings a taper to the outward room, 
Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light, 
And after brings it nearer to thy sight; 
For such approaches doth heaven make in death. 
Think thyself labouring now with broken breath, 
And think those broken and soft notes to be 
Division, and thy happiest harmony. 
Think thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slack, 
And think that but unbinding of a pack, 
To take one precious thing, thy soul, from thence. 
Think thyself parch'd with fever's violence; 
Anger thine ague more, by calling it 
Thy physic; chide the slackness of the fit. 
Think that thou hear'st thy knell, and think no more, 
But that, as bells call'd thee to church before, 
So this to the Triumphant Church calls thee. 
Think Satan's sergeants round about thee be, 
And think that but for legacies they thrust; 
Give one thy pride, to'another give thy lust; 
Give them those sins which they gave thee before, 
And trust th' immaculate blood to wash thy score. 
Think thy friends weeping round, and think that they 
Weep but because they go not yet thy way. 
Think that they close thine eyes, and think in this, 
That they confess much in the world amiss, 
Who dare not trust a dead man's eye with that 
Which they from God and angels cover not. 
Think that they shroud thee up, and think from thence 
They reinvest thee in white innocence. 
Think that thy body rots, and (if so low, 
Thy soul exalted so, thy thoughts can go) 
Think thee a prince, who of themselves create 
Worms, which insensibly devour their state. 
Think that they bury thee, and think that rite 
Lays thee to sleep but a Saint Lucy's night.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Growing Old', 'Health & Illness', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'The Body', 'Time & Brevity', 'Nature', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Allusion', 'Metaphor', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44123/of-the-progress-of-the-soul-the-second-anniversary,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.

Should now love less, what he did love to see?

Was but the milk which in love's childish state 
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough 
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.""",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'The Body', 'Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44100/elegy-v-his-picture,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Donne,1572–1631,Elegy IX: The Autumnal,"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace 
         As I have seen in one autumnal face. 
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape, 
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape. 
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame; 
         Affection here takes reverence's name. 
Were her first years the golden age? That's true, 
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new. 
That was her torrid and inflaming time, 
         This is her tolerable tropic clime. 
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence, 
         He in a fever wishes pestilence. 
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were, 
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where. 
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit 
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit; 
And here till hers, which must be his death, come, 
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb. 
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere 
         In progress, yet his standing house is here: 
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night, 
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight. 
In all her words, unto all hearers fit, 
         You may at revels, you at council, sit. 
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood; 
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood, 
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste 
         And appetite to other things is past. 
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree, 
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she, 
Or else because, being young, nature did bless 
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness. 
If we love things long sought, age is a thing 
         Which we are fifty years in compassing; 
If transitory things, which soon decay, 
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day. 
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack, 
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack; 
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade; 
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made; 
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone, 
         To vex their souls at resurrection: 
Name not these living death's-heads unto me, 
         For these, not ancient, but antique be. 
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay 
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day. 
Since such love's natural lation is, may still 
         My love descend, and journey down the hill, 
Not panting after growing beauties. So, 
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Growing Old', 'The Body', 'Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Nature', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44101/elegy-ix-the-autumnal,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-donne,,1572.0,1631.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Ben Jonson,1572–1637,"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare","To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name, 
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame; 
While I confess thy writings to be such 
As neither man nor muse can praise too much; 
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways 
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise; 
For seeliest ignorance on these may light, 
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right; 
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance 
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance; 
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise, 
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise. 
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore 
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more? 
But thou art proof against them, and indeed, 
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need. 
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age! 
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! 
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by 
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie 
A little further, to make thee a room: 
Thou art a monument without a tomb, 
And art alive still while thy book doth live 
And we have wits to read and praise to give. 
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses, 
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses, 
For if I thought my judgment were of years, 
I should commit thee surely with thy peers, 
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine, 
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line. 
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek, 
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek 
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus, 
Euripides and Sophocles to us; 
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead, 
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread, 
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on, 
Leave thee alone for the comparison 
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome 
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come. 
Tri'umph, my Britain, thou hast one to show 
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe. 
He was not of an age but for all time! 
And all the Muses still were in their prime, 
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm 
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm! 
Nature herself was proud of his designs 
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines, 
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit, 
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit. 
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes, 
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please, 
But antiquated and deserted lie, 
As they were not of Nature's family. 
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art, 
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part. 
For though the poet's matter nature be, 
His art doth give the fashion; and, that he 
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat, 
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat 
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same 
(And himself with it) that he thinks to frame, 
Or, for the laurel, he may gain a scorn; 
For a good poet's made, as well as born; 
And such wert thou. Look how the father's face 
Lives in his issue, even so the race 
Of Shakespeare's mind and manners brightly shines 
In his well-turned, and true-filed lines; 
In each of which he seems to shake a lance, 
As brandish'd at the eyes of ignorance. 
Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were 
To see thee in our waters yet appear, 
And make those flights upon the banks of Thames, 
That so did take Eliza and our James! 
But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere 
Advanc'd, and made a constellation there! 
Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage

Ben Jonson,1572–1637,An Ode to Himself,"Where dost thou careless lie, 
Buried in ease and sloth? 
Knowledge that sleeps doth die; 
And this security, 
It is the common moth 
That eats on wits and arts, and oft destroys them both. 
 
Are all th' Aonian springs 
Dried up? lies Thespia waste? 
Doth Clarius' harp want strings, 
That not a nymph now sings? 
Or droop they as disgrac'd, 
To see their seats and bowers by chatt'ring pies defac'd? 
 
If hence thy silence be, 
As 'tis too just a cause, 
Let this thought quicken thee: 
Minds that are great and free 
Should not on fortune pause; 
'Tis crown enough to virtue still, her own applause. 
 
What though the greedy fry 
Be taken with false baites 
Of worded balladry, 
And think it poesy? 
They die with their conceits, 
And only piteous scorn upon their folly waits. 
 
Then take in hand thy lyre, 
Strike in thy proper strain, 
With Japhet's line aspire 
Sol's chariot for new fire, 
To give the world again; 
Who aided him will thee, the issue of Jove's brain. 
 
And since our dainty age 
Cannot endure reproof, 
Make not thyself a page 
To that strumpet, the stage,

Safe from the wolf's black jaw and the dull ass's hoof.",ode,types/modes,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Social Commentaries', 'Ode']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44462/an-ode-to-himself,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/ben-jonson,,1572.0,1637.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Ben Jonson,1572–1637,Ode to Himself [“Come leave the loathéd stage”],"Come leave the loathéd stage,
          And the more loathsome age,
 Where pride and impudence in faction knit
          Usurp the chair of wit, 
 Indicting and arraigning, every day,
          Something they call a play. 
      Let their fastidious, vain
      Commission of the brain
 Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condemn:
 They were not made for thee, less thou for them.
  
          Say that thou pour’st ’em wheat,
          And they would acorns eat;
 ‘Twere simple fury, still thyself to waste
          On such as have no taste;
 To offer them a surfeit of pure bread,
          Whose appetites are dead;
      No, give them grains their fill,
      Husks, draff to drink, and swill;
 If they love lees, and leave the lusty wine,
 Envy them not, their palate’s with the swine.
  
          No doubt a moldy tale,
          Like Pericles, and stale
 As the shrive’s crusts, and nasty as his fish,
          Scraps out of every dish
 Thrown forth, and raked into the common tub,
          May keep up the Play Club.
      Broome’s sweepings do as well
      There as his master’s meal;
 For who the relish of these guests will fit
 Needs set them but the alms-basket of wit.
  
          And much good do’t ye then,
          Brave plush and velvet men
 Can feed on orts, and safe in your scene clothes,
          Dare quit upon your oaths
 The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peers)
          Of stuffing your large ears
      With rage of comic socks, 
      Wrought upon twenty blocks;
 Which, if they’re torn, and foul, and patched enough,
 The gamesters share your guilt, and you their stuff.
  
          Leave things so prostitute,
          And take th’Alcaic lute;
 Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon’s lyre;
          Warm thee by Pindar’s fire;
 And though thy nerves be shrunk, and blood be cold,
          Ere years have made thee old,
      Strike that disdainful heat
      Throughout, to their defeat;
 As curious fools, and envious of thy stain,
 May, blushing, swear no palsy’s in thy brain.
  
          But when they hear thee sing
          The glories of thy King,
 His zeal to God, and his just awe of men,
          They may be blood-shaken, then
 Feel such a flesh-quake to possess their powers,
          That no tuned harp like ours,
      In sound of peace or wars,

Weep with me, all you that read
     This little story:
And know, for whom a tear you shed
     Death's self is sorry.
'Twas a child, that so did thrive
     In grace and feature,
As heaven and nature seem'd to strive
     Which own'd the creature.
Years he number'd scarce thirteen
     When fates turn'd cruel,
Yet three fill'd zodiacs had he been
     The stage's jewel;
And did act (what now we moan)
     Old men so duly,
As, sooth, the Parcæ thought him one,
     He play'd so truly.
So, by error, to his fate
     They all consented;
But viewing him since (alas, too late)
     They have repented;
And have sought (to give new birth)
     In baths to steep him;
But being so much too good for earth,
     Heaven vows to keep him.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Philosophy', 'Elegy', 'Epigraph']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44453/an-epitaph-on-sp,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/ben-jonson,,1572.0,1637.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

                     Fresh-quilted colours through the aire: 
                     Get up, sweet-Slug-a-bed, and see 
                     The Dew-bespangling Herbe and Tree. 
Each Flower has wept, and bow'd toward the East, 
Above an houre since; yet you not drest, 
                     Nay! not so much as out of bed? 
                     When all the Birds have Mattens seyd, 
                     And sung their thankful Hymnes: 'tis sin,

When as a thousand Virgins on this day, 
Spring, sooner than the Lark, to fetch in May. 
 
Rise; and put on your Foliage, and be seene 
To come forth, like the Spring-time, fresh and greene; 
                     And sweet as Flora. Take no care 
                     For Jewels for your Gowne, or Haire: 
                     Feare not; the leaves will strew 
                     Gemms in abundance upon you: 
Besides, the childhood of the Day has kept, 
Against you come, some Orient Pearls unwept: 
                     Come, and receive them while the light 
                     Hangs on the Dew-locks of the night: 
                     And Titan on the Eastern hill 
                     Retires himselfe, or else stands still 
Till you come forth. Wash, dresse, be briefe in praying: 
Few Beads are best, when once we goe a Maying. 
 
Come, my Corinna, come; and comming, marke 
How each field turns a street; each street a Parke 
                     Made green, and trimm'd with trees: see how

There's not a budding Boy, or Girle, this day, 
But is got up, and gone to bring in May.

And chose their Priest, ere we can cast off sloth:

Many a jest told of the Keyes betraying 
This night, and Locks pickt, yet w'are not a Maying. 
 
Come, let us goe, while we are in our prime; 
And take the harmlesse follie of the time. 
                     We shall grow old apace, and die 
                     Before we know our liberty. 
                     Our life is short; and our dayes run 
                     As fast away as do's the Sunne: 
And as a vapour, or a drop of raine 
Once lost, can ne'r be found againe: 
                     So when or you or I are made 
                     A fable, song, or fleeting shade; 
                     All love, all liking, all delight

         Wherein to dwell, 
A little house, whose humble roof 
         Is weather-proof: 
Under the spars of which I lie 
         Both soft, and dry; 
Where Thou my chamber for to ward 
         Hast set a guard 
Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep

Low is my porch, as is my fate, 
         Both void of state; 
And yet the threshold of my door 
         Is worn by th' poor, 
Who thither come and freely get 
         Good words, or meat. 
Like as my parlour, so my hall

A little buttery, and therein 
         A little bin, 
Which keeps my little loaf of bread 
         Unchipp'd, unflead; 
Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar 
         Make me a fire, 
Close by whose living coal I sit, 
         And glow like it. 
Lord, I confess too, when I dine,

And all those other bits, that be 
         There plac'd by Thee; 
The worts, the purslain, and the mess 
         Of water-cress, 
Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent; 
         And my content 
Makes those, and my beloved beet, 
         To be more sweet. 
'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering hearth 
         With guiltless mirth; 
And giv'st me wassail-bowls to drink, 
         Spic'd to the brink. 
Lord, 'tis Thy plenty-dropping hand 
         That soils my land; 
And giv'st me, for my bushel sown, 
         Twice ten for one; 
Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay 
         Her egg each day; 
Besides my healthful ewes to bear 
         Me twins each year; 
The while the conduits of my kine 
         Run cream, for wine. 
All these, and better, Thou dost send 
         Me, to this end, 
That I should render, for my part, 
         A thankful heart, 
Which, fir'd with incense, I resign,

My private protonotary?

A short and sweet iniquity?

Shall see the hugg'd impiety.

To lay thy pen and ink aside,

Wanton I may, and thou not write?

Now thou art dead (great Donne) one elegy 
To crown thy hearse? Why yet dare we not trust, 
Though with unkneaded dough-bak'd prose, thy dust, 
Such as th' unscissor'd churchman from the flower 
Of fading rhetoric, short-liv'd as his hour, 
Dry as the sand that measures it, should lay 
Upon thy ashes, on the funeral day? 
Have we no voice, no tune? Didst thou dispense 
Through all our language, both the words and sense? 
'Tis a sad truth. The pulpit may her plain 
And sober Christian precepts still retain, 
Doctrines it may, and wholesome uses, frame, 
Grave homilies and lectures, but the flame 
Of thy brave soul (that shot such heat and light 
As burnt our earth and made our darkness bright, 
Committed holy rapes upon our will, 
Did through the eye the melting heart distil, 
And the deep knowledge of dark truths so teach 
As sense might judge what fancy could not reach) 
Must be desir'd forever. So the fire 
That fills with spirit and heat the Delphic quire, 
Which, kindled first by thy Promethean breath, 
Glow'd here a while, lies quench'd now in thy death. 
The Muses' garden, with pedantic weeds 
O'erspread, was purg'd by thee; the lazy seeds 
Of servile imitation thrown away, 
And fresh invention planted; thou didst pay 
The debts of our penurious bankrupt age; 
Licentious thefts, that make poetic rage 
A mimic fury, when our souls must be 
Possess'd, or with Anacreon's ecstasy, 
Or Pindar's, not their own; the subtle cheat 
Of sly exchanges, and the juggling feat 
Of two-edg'd words, or whatsoever wrong 
By ours was done the Greek or Latin tongue, 
Thou hast redeem'd, and open'd us a mine 
Of rich and pregnant fancy; drawn a line 
Of masculine expression, which had good 
Old Orpheus seen, or all the ancient brood 
Our superstitious fools admire, and hold 
Their lead more precious than thy burnish'd gold, 
Thou hadst been their exchequer, and no more 
They each in other's dust had rak'd for ore. 
Thou shalt yield no precedence, but of time, 
And the blind fate of language, whose tun'd chime 
More charms the outward sense; yet thou mayst claim 
From so great disadvantage greater fame, 
Since to the awe of thy imperious wit 
Our stubborn language bends, made only fit 
With her tough thick-ribb'd hoops to gird about 
Thy giant fancy, which had prov'd too stout 
For their soft melting phrases. As in time 
They had the start, so did they cull the prime 
Buds of invention many a hundred year, 
And left the rifled fields, besides the fear 
To touch their harvest; yet from those bare lands 
Of what is purely thine, thy only hands, 
(And that thy smallest work) have gleaned more 
Than all those times and tongues could reap before. 
         But thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be 
Too hard for libertines in poetry; 
They will repeal the goodly exil'd train 
Of gods and goddesses, which in thy just reign 
Were banish'd nobler poems; now with these, 
The silenc'd tales o' th' Metamorphoses 
Shall stuff their lines, and swell the windy page, 
Till verse, refin'd by thee, in this last age 
Turn ballad rhyme, or those old idols be 
Ador'd again, with new apostasy. 
         Oh, pardon me, that break with untun'd verse 
The reverend silence that attends thy hearse, 
Whose awful solemn murmurs were to thee, 
More than these faint lines, a loud elegy, 
That did proclaim in a dumb eloquence 
The death of all the arts; whose influence, 
Grown feeble, in these panting numbers lies, 
Gasping short-winded accents, and so dies. 
So doth the swiftly turning wheel not stand 
In th' instant we withdraw the moving hand, 
But some small time maintain a faint weak course, 
By virtue of the first impulsive force; 
And so, whilst I cast on thy funeral pile 
Thy crown of bays, oh, let it crack awhile, 
And spit disdain, till the devouring flashes 
Suck all the moisture up, then turn to ashes. 
         I will not draw the envy to engross 
All thy perfections, or weep all our loss; 
Those are too numerous for an elegy, 
And this too great to be express'd by me. 
Though every pen should share a distinct part, 
Yet art thou theme enough to tire all art; 
Let others carve the rest, it shall suffice 
I on thy tomb this epitaph incise: 
         Here lies a king, that rul'd as he thought fit

Thomas Carew,1595–1640,To Ben Jonson,"Tis true, dear Ben, thy just chastising hand
Hath fix'd upon the sotted age a brand
To their swoll'n pride and empty scribbling due;
It can nor judge, nor write, and yet 'tis true
Thy comic muse, from the exalted line
Touch'd by thy Alchemist, doth since decline
From that her zenith, and foretells a red
And blushing evening, when she goes to bed;
Yet such as shall outshine the glimmering light
With which all stars shall gild the following night.
Nor think it much, since all thy eaglets may
Endure the sunny trial, if we say
This hath the stronger wing, or that doth shine
Trick'd up in fairer plumes, since all are thine.
Who hath his flock of cackling geese compar'd
With thy tun'd choir of swans? or else who dar'd
To call thy births deform'd? But if thou bind
By city-custom, or by gavelkind,
In equal shares thy love on all thy race,
We may distinguish of their sex, and place;
Though one hand form them, and though one brain strike
Souls into all, they are not all alike.
Why should the follies then of this dull age
Draw from thy pen such an immodest rage
As seems to blast thy else-immortal bays,
When thine own tongue proclaims thy itch of praise?
Such thirst will argue drouth. No, let be hurl'd
Upon thy works by the detracting world
What malice can suggest; let the rout say,
The running sands, that, ere thou make a play,
Count the slow minutes, might a Goodwin frame
To swallow, when th' hast done, thy shipwreck'd name;
Let them the dear expense of oil upbraid,
Suck'd by thy watchful lamp, that hath betray'd
To theft the blood of martyr'd authors, spilt
Into thy ink, whilst thou growest pale with guilt.
Repine not at the taper's thrifty waste,
That sleeks thy terser poems; nor is haste
Praise, but excuse; and if thou overcome
A knotty writer, bring the booty home;
Nor think it theft if the rich spoils so torn
From conquer'd authors be as trophies worn.
Let others glut on the extorted praise
Of vulgar breath, trust thou to after-days;
Thy labour'd works shall live when time devours
Th' abortive offspring of their hasty hours.
Thou are not of their rank, the quarrel lies

Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost 
Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream 
Upon the silver lake or crystal stream; 
But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth, 
And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth 
To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree 
The drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee. 
Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring 
In triumph to the world the youthful Spring. 
The valleys, hills, and woods in rich array 
Welcome the coming of the long'd-for May. 
Now all things smile, only my love doth lour; 
Nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power 
To melt that marble ice, which still doth hold 
Her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold. 
The ox, which lately did for shelter fly 
Into the stall, doth now securely lie 
In open fields; and love no more is made 
By the fireside, but in the cooler shade 
Amyntas now doth with his Chloris sleep 
Under a sycamore, and all things keep 
Time with the season; only she doth carry 
June in her eyes, in her heart January.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Love', 'Break-ups & Vexed Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Spring', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43881/the-spring-56d222c1918e0,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/thomas-carew,,1595.0,1640.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Thomas Carew,1595–1640,"An Elegy upon the Death of the Dean of Paul's, Dr. John Donne","Can we not force from widow'd poetry, 
Now thou art dead (great Donne) one elegy 
To crown thy hearse? Why yet dare we not trust, 
Though with unkneaded dough-bak'd prose, thy dust, 
Such as th' unscissor'd churchman from the flower 
Of fading rhetoric, short-liv'd as his hour, 
Dry as the sand that measures it, should lay 
Upon thy ashes, on the funeral day? 
Have we no voice, no tune? Didst thou dispense 
Through all our language, both the words and sense? 
'Tis a sad truth. The pulpit may her plain 
And sober Christian precepts still retain, 
Doctrines it may, and wholesome uses, frame, 
Grave homilies and lectures, but the flame 
Of thy brave soul (that shot such heat and light 
As burnt our earth and made our darkness bright, 
Committed holy rapes upon our will, 
Did through the eye the melting heart distil, 
And the deep knowledge of dark truths so teach 
As sense might judge what fancy could not reach) 
Must be desir'd forever. So the fire 
That fills with spirit and heat the Delphic quire, 
Which, kindled first by thy Promethean breath, 
Glow'd here a while, lies quench'd now in thy death. 
The Muses' garden, with pedantic weeds 
O'erspread, was purg'd by thee; the lazy seeds 
Of servile imitation thrown away, 
And fresh invention planted; thou didst pay 
The debts of our penurious bankrupt age; 
Licentious thefts, that make poetic rage 
A mimic fury, when our souls must be 
Possess'd, or with Anacreon's ecstasy, 
Or Pindar's, not their own; the subtle cheat 
Of sly exchanges, and the juggling feat 
Of two-edg'd words, or whatsoever wrong 
By ours was done the Greek or Latin tongue, 
Thou hast redeem'd, and open'd us a mine 
Of rich and pregnant fancy; drawn a line 
Of masculine expression, which had good 
Old Orpheus seen, or all the ancient brood 
Our superstitious fools admire, and hold 
Their lead more precious than thy burnish'd gold, 
Thou hadst been their exchequer, and no more 
They each in other's dust had rak'd for ore. 
Thou shalt yield no precedence, but of time, 
And the blind fate of language, whose tun'd chime 
More charms the outward sense; yet thou mayst claim 
From so great disadvantage greater fame, 
Since to the awe of thy imperious wit 
Our stubborn language bends, made only fit 
With her tough thick-ribb'd hoops to gird about 
Thy giant fancy, which had prov'd too stout 
For their soft melting phrases. As in time 
They had the start, so did they cull the prime 
Buds of invention many a hundred year, 
And left the rifled fields, besides the fear 
To touch their harvest; yet from those bare lands 
Of what is purely thine, thy only hands, 
(And that thy smallest work) have gleaned more 
Than all those times and tongues could reap before. 
         But thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be 
Too hard for libertines in poetry; 
They will repeal the goodly exil'd train 
Of gods and goddesses, which in thy just reign 
Were banish'd nobler poems; now with these, 
The silenc'd tales o' th' Metamorphoses 
Shall stuff their lines, and swell the windy page, 
Till verse, refin'd by thee, in this last age 
Turn ballad rhyme, or those old idols be 
Ador'd again, with new apostasy. 
         Oh, pardon me, that break with untun'd verse 
The reverend silence that attends thy hearse, 
Whose awful solemn murmurs were to thee, 
More than these faint lines, a loud elegy, 
That did proclaim in a dumb eloquence 
The death of all the arts; whose influence, 
Grown feeble, in these panting numbers lies, 
Gasping short-winded accents, and so dies. 
So doth the swiftly turning wheel not stand 
In th' instant we withdraw the moving hand, 
But some small time maintain a faint weak course, 
By virtue of the first impulsive force; 
And so, whilst I cast on thy funeral pile 
Thy crown of bays, oh, let it crack awhile, 
And spit disdain, till the devouring flashes 
Suck all the moisture up, then turn to ashes. 
         I will not draw the envy to engross 
All thy perfections, or weep all our loss; 
Those are too numerous for an elegy, 
And this too great to be express'd by me. 
Though every pen should share a distinct part, 
Yet art thou theme enough to tire all art; 
Let others carve the rest, it shall suffice 
I on thy tomb this epitaph incise: 
         Here lies a king, that rul'd as he thought fit 
         The universal monarchy of wit; 
         Here lie two flamens, and both those, the best,

And o’er the centre spread the liquid main, 
Thy power were safe; and her destructive hand 
Would but enlarge the bounds of thy command: 
Thy dreadful fleet would style thee lord of all, 
And ride in triumph o’er the drowned ball: 
Those towers of oak o’er fertile plains might go, 
And visit mountains, where they once did grow.

No mortal parts are requisite to raise
Her, that unbodied can her Maker praise.

So calm are we, when passions are no more:

Of fleeting things, so certain to be lost.

Conceal that emptiness, which age descries.

Zephyr, with Aurora playing, 
As he met her once a-Maying, 
There on beds of violets blue, 
And fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew, 
Fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair, 
So buxom, blithe, and debonair. 
Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee 
Jest and youthful Jollity, 
Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles,

And singing startle the dull night, 
From his watch-tower in the skies, 
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;

And at my window bid good-morrow, 
Through the sweet-briar, or the vine, 
Or the twisted eglantine; 
While the cock with lively din, 
Scatters the rear of darkness thin, 
And to the stack, or the barn door, 
Stoutly struts his dames before; 
Oft list'ning how the hounds and horn 
Cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn, 
From the side of some hoar hill, 
Through the high wood echoing shrill. 
Sometime walking, not unseen, 
By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, 
Right against the eastern gate, 
Where the great Sun begins his state, 
Rob'd in flames, and amber light, 
The clouds in thousand liveries dight. 
While the ploughman near at hand, 
Whistles o'er the furrow'd land, 
And the milkmaid singeth blithe, 
And the mower whets his scythe, 
And every shepherd tells his tale 
Under the hawthorn in the dale. 
Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures 
Whilst the landskip round it measures, 
Russet lawns, and fallows gray, 
Where the nibbling flocks do stray; 
Mountains on whose barren breast 
The labouring clouds do often rest; 
Meadows trim with daisies pied, 
Shallow brooks, and rivers wide. 
Towers, and battlements it sees 
Bosom'd high in tufted trees, 
Where perhaps some beauty lies, 
The cynosure of neighbouring eyes. 
Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, 
From betwixt two aged oaks, 
Where Corydon and Thyrsis met, 
Are at their savoury dinner set 
Of herbs, and other country messes, 
Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses; 
And then in haste her bow'r she leaves, 
With Thestylis to bind the sheaves; 
Or if the earlier season lead 
To the tann'd haycock in the mead. 
Sometimes with secure delight 
The upland hamlets will invite, 
When the merry bells ring round, 
And the jocund rebecks sound 
To many a youth, and many a maid, 
Dancing in the chequer'd shade; 
And young and old come forth to play 
On a sunshine holiday, 
Till the live-long daylight fail; 
Then to the spicy nut-brown ale, 
With stories told of many a feat, 
How Faery Mab the junkets eat, 
She was pinch'd and pull'd she said, 
And he by friar's lanthorn led, 
Tells how the drudging goblin sweat, 
To earn his cream-bowl duly set, 
When in one night, ere glimpse of morn, 
His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn 
That ten day-labourers could not end; 
Then lies him down, the lubber fiend, 
And stretch'd out all the chimney's length, 
Basks at the fire his hairy strength; 
And crop-full out of doors he flings, 
Ere the first cock his matin rings. 
Thus done the tales, to bed they creep, 
By whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. 
Tower'd cities please us then, 
And the busy hum of men, 
Where throngs of knights and barons bold, 
In weeds of peace high triumphs hold, 
With store of ladies, whose bright eyes 
Rain influence, and judge the prize 
Of wit, or arms, while both contend 
To win her grace, whom all commend. 
There let Hymen oft appear 
In saffron robe, with taper clear, 
And pomp, and feast, and revelry, 
With mask, and antique pageantry; 
Such sights as youthful poets dream 
On summer eves by haunted stream. 
Then to the well-trod stage anon, 
If Jonson's learned sock be on, 
Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child, 
Warble his native wood-notes wild. 
And ever against eating cares, 
Lap me in soft Lydian airs, 
Married to immortal verse, 
Such as the meeting soul may pierce 
In notes with many a winding bout 
Of linked sweetness long drawn out, 
With wanton heed, and giddy cunning, 
The melting voice through mazes running, 
Untwisting all the chains that tie 
The hidden soul of harmony; 
That Orpheus' self may heave his head 
From golden slumber on a bed 
Of heap'd Elysian flow'rs, and hear 
Such strains as would have won the ear 
Of Pluto, to have quite set free 
His half-regain'd Eurydice. 
These delights if thou canst give, 
Mirth, with thee I mean to live.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44731/lallegro,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Il Penseroso,"Hence vain deluding Joys, 
      The brood of Folly without father bred, 
How little you bested, 
      Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys; 
Dwell in some idle brain, 
      And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess, 
As thick and numberless 
      As the gay motes that people the sunbeams, 
Or likest hovering dreams, 
      The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train. 
But hail thou goddess, sage and holy, 
Hail divinest Melancholy, 
Whose saintly visage is too bright 
To hit the sense of human sight; 
And therefore to our weaker view, 
O'er-laid with black, staid Wisdom's hue; 
Black, but such as in esteem, 
Prince Memnon's sister might beseem, 
Or that starr'd Ethiop queen that strove 
To set her beauty's praise above 
The sea nymphs, and their powers offended. 
Yet thou art higher far descended, 
Thee bright-hair'd Vesta long of yore, 
To solitary Saturn bore; 
His daughter she (in Saturn's reign, 
Such mixture was not held a stain) 
Oft in glimmering bow'rs and glades 
He met her, and in secret shades 
Of woody Ida's inmost grove, 
While yet there was no fear of Jove. 
Come pensive nun, devout and pure, 
Sober, stedfast, and demure, 
All in a robe of darkest grain, 
Flowing with majestic train, 
And sable stole of cypress lawn, 
Over thy decent shoulders drawn. 
Come, but keep thy wonted state, 
With ev'n step, and musing gait, 
And looks commercing with the skies, 
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: 
There held in holy passion still, 
Forget thyself to marble, till 
With a sad leaden downward cast, 
Thou fix them on the earth as fast. 
And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet, 
Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet, 
And hears the Muses in a ring, 
Aye round about Jove's altar sing. 
And add to these retired Leisure, 
That in trim gardens takes his pleasure; 
But first, and chiefest, with thee bring 
Him that yon soars on golden wing, 
Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne, 
The cherub Contemplation; 
And the mute Silence hist along, 
'Less Philomel will deign a song, 
In her sweetest, saddest plight, 
Smoothing the rugged brow of night, 
While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke, 
Gently o'er th' accustom'd oak. 
Sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly, 
Most musical, most melancholy! 
Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among, 
I woo to hear thy even-song; 
And missing thee, I walk unseen 
On the dry smooth-shaven green, 
To behold the wand'ring Moon, 
Riding near her highest noon, 
Like one that had been led astray 
Through the heav'ns wide pathless way; 
And oft, as if her head she bow'd, 
Stooping through a fleecy cloud. 
Oft on a plat of rising ground, 
I hear the far-off curfew sound, 
Over some wide-water'd shore, 
Swinging slow with sullen roar; 
Or if the air will not permit, 
Some still removed place will fit, 
Where glowing embers through the room 
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom, 
Far from all resort of mirth, 
Save the cricket on the hearth, 
Or the bellman's drowsy charm, 
To bless the doors from nightly harm. 
Or let my lamp at midnight hour, 
Be seen in some high lonely tow'r, 
Where I may oft out-watch the Bear, 
With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere 
The spirit of Plato, to unfold 
What worlds, or what vast regions hold 
The immortal mind that hath forsook 
Her mansion in this fleshly nook: 
And of those dæmons that are found 
In fire, air, flood, or under ground, 
Whose power hath a true consent 
With planet, or with element. 
Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy 
In sceptr'd pall come sweeping by, 
Presenting Thebes', or Pelop's line, 
Or the tale of Troy divine, 
Or what (though rare) of later age, 
Ennobled hath the buskin'd stage. 
But, O sad Virgin, that thy power 
Might raise Musæus from his bower, 
Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing 
Such notes as, warbled to the string, 
Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek, 
And made Hell grant what love did seek. 
Or call up him that left half told 
The story of Cambuscan bold, 
Of Camball, and of Algarsife, 
And who had Canace to wife, 
That own'd the virtuous ring and glass, 
And of the wond'rous horse of brass, 
On which the Tartar king did ride; 
And if aught else, great bards beside, 
In sage and solemn tunes have sung, 
Of tourneys and of trophies hung, 
Of forests, and enchantments drear, 
Where more is meant than meets the ear. 
Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career, 
Till civil-suited Morn appear, 
Not trick'd and frounc'd as she was wont, 
With the Attic boy to hunt, 
But kerchief'd in a comely cloud, 
While rocking winds are piping loud, 
Or usher'd with a shower still, 
When the gust hath blown his fill, 
Ending on the rustling leaves, 
With minute-drops from off the eaves. 
And when the Sun begins to fling 
His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring 
To arched walks of twilight groves, 
And shadows brown that Sylvan loves, 
Of pine, or monumental oak, 
Where the rude axe with heaved stroke, 
Was never heard the nymphs to daunt, 
Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt. 
There in close covert by some brook, 
Where no profaner eye may look, 
Hide me from Day's garish eye, 
While the bee with honied thigh, 
That at her flow'ry work doth sing, 
And the waters murmuring 
With such consort as they keep, 
Entice the dewy-feather'd sleep; 
And let some strange mysterious dream, 
Wave at his wings, in airy stream 
Of lively portraiture display'd, 
Softly on my eye-lids laid. 
And as I wake, sweet music breathe 
Above, about, or underneath, 
Sent by some spirit to mortals good, 
Or th' unseen Genius of the wood. 
 
         But let my due feet never fail 
To walk the studious cloister's pale, 
And love the high embowed roof, 
With antique pillars massy proof, 
And storied windows richly dight, 
Casting a dim religious light. 
There let the pealing organ blow, 
To the full-voic'd quire below, 
In service high, and anthems clear, 
As may with sweetness, through mine ear, 
Dissolve me into ecstasies, 
And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes. 
And may at last my weary age 
Find out the peaceful hermitage, 
The hairy gown and mossy cell, 
Where I may sit and rightly spell 
Of every star that Heav'n doth shew, 
And every herb that sips the dew; 
Till old experience do attain 
To something like prophetic strain.

And I with thee will choose to live.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44732/il-penseroso,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

John Milton,1608–1674,from At a Vacation Exercise,"Hail native language, that by sinews weak 
Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak, 
And mad'st imperfect words with childish trips, 
Half unpronounc'd, slide through my infant lips, 
Driving dumb Silence from the portal door, 
Where he had mutely sate two years before: 
Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask, 
That now I use thee in my latter task: 
Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee, 
I know my tongue but little grace can do thee: 
Thou needst not be ambitious to be first, 
Believe me I have thither pack'd the worst: 
And, if it happen as I did forecast, 
The daintest dishes shall be serv'd up last. 
I pray thee then deny me not thy aid 
For this same small neglect that I have made: 
But haste thee straight to do me once a pleasure, 
And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest treasure; 
Not those new-fangled toys, and trimming slight 
Which takes our late fantastics with delight, 
But cull those richest robes, and gay'st attire 
Which deepest spirits, and choicest wits desire. 
I have some naked thoughts that rove about 
And loudly knock to have their passage out; 
And weary of their place do only stay 
Till thou hast deck'd them in thy best array; 
That so they may without suspect or fears 
Fly swiftly to this fair assembly's ears. 
Yet I had rather, if I were to choose, 
Thy service in some graver subject use, 
Such as may make thee search thy coffers round, 
Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound: 
Such where the deep transported mind may soar 
Above the wheeling poles, and at heav'n's door 
Look in, and see each blissful deity 
How he before the thunderous throne doth lie, 
Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings 
To th'touch of golden wires, while Hebe brings 
Immortal nectar to her kingly sire; 
Then passing through the spheres of watchful fire, 
And misty regions of wide air next under, 
And hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder, 
May tell at length how green-ey'd Neptune raves, 
In heav'n's defiance mustering all his waves; 
Then sing of secret things that came to pass 
When beldam Nature in her cradle was; 
And last of kings and queens and heroes old, 
Such as the wise Demodocus once told 
In solemn songs at king Alcinous' feast, 
While sad Ulysses' soul and all the rest 
Are held with his melodious harmony 
In willing chains and sweet captivity.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44729/at-a-vacation-exercise,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Lycidas,"Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more 
Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere, 
I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, 
And with forc'd fingers rude 
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. 
Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear 
Compels me to disturb your season due; 
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, 
Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer. 
Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew 
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme. 
He must not float upon his wat'ry bier 
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind, 
Without the meed of some melodious tear. 
 
      Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well 
That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring; 
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string. 
Hence with denial vain and coy excuse! 
So may some gentle muse 
With lucky words favour my destin'd urn, 
And as he passes turn 
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud! 
 
      For we were nurs'd upon the self-same hill, 
Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill; 
Together both, ere the high lawns appear'd 
Under the opening eyelids of the morn, 
We drove afield, and both together heard 
What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn, 
Batt'ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night, 
Oft till the star that rose at ev'ning bright 
Toward heav'n's descent had slop'd his westering wheel. 
Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute, 
Temper'd to th'oaten flute; 
Rough Satyrs danc'd, and Fauns with clov'n heel, 
From the glad sound would not be absent long; 
And old Damætas lov'd to hear our song. 
 
      But O the heavy change now thou art gone, 
Now thou art gone, and never must return! 
Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves, 
With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown, 
And all their echoes mourn. 
The willows and the hazel copses green 
Shall now no more be seen 
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays. 
As killing as the canker to the rose, 
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze, 
Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear 
When first the white thorn blows: 
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear. 
 
      Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep 
Clos'd o'er the head of your lov'd Lycidas? 
For neither were ye playing on the steep 
Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie, 
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high, 
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream. 
Ay me! I fondly dream 
Had ye bin there'—for what could that have done? 
What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore, 
The Muse herself, for her enchanting son, 
Whom universal nature did lament, 
When by the rout that made the hideous roar 
His gory visage down the stream was sent, 
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore? 
 
      Alas! what boots it with incessant care 
To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade, 
And strictly meditate the thankless Muse? 
Were it not better done, as others use, 
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, 
Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair? 
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise 
(That last infirmity of noble mind) 
To scorn delights and live laborious days; 
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find, 
And think to burst out into sudden blaze, 
Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears, 
And slits the thin-spun life. ""But not the praise,"" 
Phoebus replied, and touch'd my trembling ears; 
""Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, 
Nor in the glistering foil 
Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies, 
But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes 
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove; 
As he pronounces lastly on each deed, 
Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed."" 
 
      O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd flood, 
Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocal reeds, 
That strain I heard was of a higher mood. 
But now my oat proceeds, 
And listens to the Herald of the Sea, 
That came in Neptune's plea. 
He ask'd the waves, and ask'd the felon winds, 
""What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?"" 
And question'd every gust of rugged wings 
That blows from off each beaked promontory. 
They knew not of his story; 
And sage Hippotades their answer brings, 
That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd; 
The air was calm, and on the level brine 
Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd. 
It was that fatal and perfidious bark, 
Built in th'eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark, 
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine. 
 
      Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow, 
His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge, 
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge 
Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe. 
""Ah! who hath reft,"" quoth he, ""my dearest pledge?"" 
Last came, and last did go, 
The Pilot of the Galilean lake; 
Two massy keys he bore of metals twain 
(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). 
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake: 
""How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain, 
Enow of such as for their bellies' sake 
Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold? 
Of other care they little reck'ning make 
Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast 
And shove away the worthy bidden guest. 
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold 
A sheep-hook, or have learn'd aught else the least 
That to the faithful herdman's art belongs! 
What recks it them? What need they? They are sped; 
And when they list their lean and flashy songs 
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw, 
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, 
But, swoll'n with wind and the rank mist they draw, 
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread; 
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw 
Daily devours apace, and nothing said, 
But that two-handed engine at the door 
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more"". 
 
      Return, Alpheus: the dread voice is past 
That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse, 
And call the vales and bid them hither cast 
Their bells and flow'rets of a thousand hues. 
Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use 
Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks, 
On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks, 
Throw hither all your quaint enamel'd eyes, 
That on the green turf suck the honied showers 
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers. 
Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, 
The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, 
The white pink, and the pansy freak'd with jet, 
The glowing violet, 
The musk-rose, and the well attir'd woodbine, 
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, 
And every flower that sad embroidery wears; 
Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, 
And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, 
To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. 
For so to interpose a little ease, 
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise. 
Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas 
Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurl'd; 
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides, 
Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide 
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world, 
Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied, 
Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old, 
Where the great vision of the guarded mount 
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold: 
Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth; 
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth. 
 
      Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, 
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, 
Sunk though he be beneath the wat'ry floor; 
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, 
And yet anon repairs his drooping head, 
And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore 
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: 
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high 
Through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves; 
Where, other groves and other streams along, 
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, 
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, 
In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. 
There entertain him all the Saints above, 
In solemn troops, and sweet societies, 
That sing, and singing in their glory move, 
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes. 
Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more: 
Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore, 
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good 
To all that wander in that perilous flood. 
 
      Thus sang the uncouth swain to th'oaks and rills, 
While the still morn went out with sandals gray; 
He touch'd the tender stops of various quills, 
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay; 
And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills, 
And now was dropp'd into the western bay; 
At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue: 
To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44733/lycidas,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,
He trusted to have equal'd the most High,
If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God
Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud
With vain attempt.   Him the Almighty Power
Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie
With hideous ruine and combustion down
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,
Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe
Confounded though immortal: But his doom
Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witness'd huge affliction and dismay
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:
At once as far as Angels kenn he views
The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
Serv'd onely to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all; but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd
For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained
In utter darkness, and thir portion set
As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n
As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.
O how unlike the place from whence they fell!
There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side
One next himself in power, and next in crime,
Long after known in Palestine, and nam'd
Beelzebub.   To whom th' Arch-Enemy,
And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence thus began.

If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light
Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest
From what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew
The force of those dire Arms?   yet not for those,
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict, do I repent or change,
Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind
And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,
That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,
And to the fierce contention brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,
And shook his throne.   What though the field be lost?
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?
That Glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me.   To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,
Since through experience of this great event
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,
Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.

So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:
And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.

O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;
And put to proof his high Supremacy,
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
Too well I see and rue the dire event,
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host
In horrible destruction laid thus low,
As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences
Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
Though all our Glory extinct and happy state
Here swallow'd up in endless misery.
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now
Of force believe Almighty, since no less
Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
Or do him mightier service as his thralls
By right of Warr, what e're his business be
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
What can it then avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being
To undergo eternal punishment?
Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.

Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,
To do ought good never will be our task,
But ever to do ill our sole delight,
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist.   If then his Providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
Our labour must be to pervert that end,
And out of good still to find means of evil;
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.
But see the angry Victor hath recall'd
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous Hail
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice
Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,
Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,
The seat of desolation, voyd of light,
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful?   Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,
And reassembling our afflicted Powers,
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,
How overcome this dire Calamity,
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,
If not what resolution from despare.

Thus Satan to his neerest Mate
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes
That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,
Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove,
Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den
By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast
Leviathan, which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:
Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam
The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence
Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
Left him at large to his own dark designs,
That with reiterated crimes he might
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
Evil to others, and enrag'd might see
How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn
On Man by him seduc't, but on himself
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames
Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld
In billows, leave i'th'midst a horrid Vale.
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land
He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn'd
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;
And such appear'd in hue, as when the force
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill
Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side
Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible
And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,
Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,
And leave a singed bottom all involv'd
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole
Of unblest feet.   Him followed his next Mate,
Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood
As Gods, and by thir own recover'd strength,
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.

Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat
That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom
For that celestial light?   Be it so, since he
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
What shall be right: fardest from him his best
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
Above his equals.   Farewel happy Fields
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new Possessor:   One who brings
A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.
The mind is its own place, and in it self
Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.
What matter where, if I be still the same,
And what I should be, all but less then he
Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Th' associates and copartners of our loss
Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?

So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub
Thus answer'd.   Leader of those Armies bright,
Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,
If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge
Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults
Thir surest signal, they will soon resume
New courage and revive, though now they lye
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,
No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.

He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend
Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
Behind him cast; the broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views
At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole,
Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands,
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,
He walkt with to support uneasie steps
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks
In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades
High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge
Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew
Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry,
While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd
The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
From the safe shore thir floating Carkases
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
Under amazement of thir hideous change.
He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep
Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,
If such astonishment as this can sieze
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place
After the toyl of Battel to repose
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conquerour?   who now beholds
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood
With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon
His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern
Th' advantage, and descending tread us down
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.

They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd
Innumerable.   As when the potent Rod
Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day
Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud
Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,
That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile:
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell
'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear
Of thir great Sultan waving to direct
Thir course, in even ballance down they light
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
A multitude, like which the populous North
Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood
Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
Though of thir Names in heav'nly Records now
Be no memorial blotted out and ras'd
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,
By falsities and lyes the greatest part
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
God thir Creator, and th' invisible
Glory of him that made them, to transform
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
And Devils to adore for Deities:
Then were they known to men by various Names,
And various Idols through the Heathen World.
Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,
Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix
Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God,
Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd
Among the Nations round, and durst abide
Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd
Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd
Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,
Abominations; and with cursed things
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,
And with thir darkness durst affront his light.
First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud
Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire
To his grim Idol.   Him the Ammonite
Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream
Of utmost Arnon.   Not content with such
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraud to build
His Temple right against the Temple of God
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence
And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell.
Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons,
From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild
Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon
And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond
The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,
And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool.
Peor his other Name, when he entic'd
Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd
Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;
Till good Josiah drove them hence to Hell.
With these cam they, who from the bordring flood
Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,
These Feminine.   For Spirits when they please
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
And uncompounded is thir Essence pure,
Nor ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,
Can execute thir aerie purposes,
And works of love or enmity fulfill.
For those the Race of Israel oft forsook
Thir living strength, and unfrequented left
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low
Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear
Of despicable foes.   With these in troop
Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd
Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon
Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,
In Sion also not unsung, where stood
Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell
To idols foul.   Thammuz came next behind,
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd
The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
While smooth Adonis from his native Rock
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded; the Love-tale
Infected Sions daughters with like heat,
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch
Ezekial saw, when by the Vision led
His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries
Of alienated Judah.   Next came one
Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark
Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,
Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:
Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high
Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon
And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat
Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
He also against the house of God was bold:
A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,
Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew
Gods Altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods
Whom he had vanquisht.   After these appear'd
A crew who under Names of old Renown,
Osiris, Isis, Orus and thir Train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd
Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek
Thir wandring Gods Disguis'd in brutish forms
Rather then human.   Nor did Israel scape
Th' infection when thir borrow'd Gold compos'd
The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King
Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,
Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd
From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods
Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd
With lust and violence the house of God.
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,
And injury and outrage: And when Night
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
Expos'd a Matron to avoid worse rape.
These were the prime in order and in might;
The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,
Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans issue held
Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth
Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born
With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd
By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove
His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;
So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet
And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top
Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air
Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff,
Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old
Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields,
And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles.
All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd
Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
In loss itself; which on his count'nance cast
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais'd
Thir fanting courage, and dispel'd thir fears.
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd
Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall:
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld
Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:
At which the universal Host upsent
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move
In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd
To hight of noblest temper Hero's old
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage
Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds.   Thus they
Breathing united force with fixed thought
Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd
Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now
Advanc't in view, they stand, a horrid Front
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise
Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief
Had to impose: He through the armed Files
Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,
Thir number last he summs.   And now his heart
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength
Glories: For never since created man,
Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these
Could merit more then that small infantry
Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood
Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd
That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side
Mixt with auxiliar Gods;   and what resounds
In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons
Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;
And all who since Baptiz'd or Infidel
Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,
Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell
By Fontarabbia.   Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd
Thir dread commander: he above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost
All her Original brightness, nor appear'd
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess
Of Glory obscur'd;   As when the Sun new ris'n
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds
On half the Nations, and with fear of change
Perplexes Monarch.   Dark'n'd so, yet shon
Above them all th' Arch Angel; but his face
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd
For ever now to have thir lot in pain,
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't
Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,
Thir Glory witherd.   As when Heavens Fire
Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,
With singed top thir stately growth though bare
Stands on the blasted Heath.   He now prepar'd
To speak; whereat thir doubl'd Ranks they bend
From wing to wing, and half enclose him round
With all his Peers: attention held them mute.
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn,
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last
Words interwove with sighs found out thir way.

O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers
Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife
Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,
As this place testifies, and this dire change
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth
Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,
How such united force of Gods, how such
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile
Hath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to re-ascend
Self-rais'd, and repossess thir native seat?
For mee be witness all the Host of Heav'n,
If counsels different, or danger shun'd
By mee, have lost our hopes.   But he who reigns
Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,
Consent or custome, and his Regal State
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own
So as not either to provoke, or dread
New warr, provok't; our better part remains
To work in close design, by fraud or guile
What force effected not: that he no less
At length from us may find, who overcomes
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long
Intended to create, and therein plant
A generation, whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:
Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abyss
Long under darkness cover.   But these thoughts
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,
For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr
Open or understood must be resolv'd.

He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms
Clash'd on thir sounding Shields the din of war,
Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heav'n.

There stood a hill not far whose griesly top
Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,
The work of Sulphur.   Thither wing'd with speed
A numerous Brigad hasten'd.   As when Bands
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm'd
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,
Or cast a Rampart.   Mammon led them on,
Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell
From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts
Were always downward bent, admiring more
The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,
Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd
In vision beatific: by him first
Men also, and by his suggestion taught
Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands
Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth
For Treasures better hid.   Soon had his crew
Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound
And dig'd out ribs of Gold.   Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best
Deserve the precious bane.   And here let those
Who boast in mortal things, and wond'ring tell
Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,
And Strength and Art are easily out-done
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour
What in an age they with incessant toyle
And hands innumerable scarce perform.
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude
With wond'rous Art found out the massie Ore,
Severing each kind, and scum'd the Bullion dross:
A third as soon had form'd within the ground
A various mould, and from the boyling cells
By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,
As in an Organ from one blast of wind
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,
Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,
The Roof was fretted Gold.   Not Babilon,
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine
Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat
Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove
In wealth and luxurie.   Th' ascending pile
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores
Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide
Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth
And level pavement: from the arched roof
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed
With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light
As from a sky.   The hasty multitude
Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise
And some the Architect: his hand was known
In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,
Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,
Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright.
Nor was his name unheard or unador'd
In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land
Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell
From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove
Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements; from Morn
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,
On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate,
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now
To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in hell.
Mean while the winged Haralds by command
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held
At Pandaemonium, the high Capital
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd
From every Band and squared Regiment
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon
With hunderds and with thousands trooping came
Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall
(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold
Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair
Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)
Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.   As Bees
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,
New rub'd with Baum, expatiate and confer
Thir State affairs.   So thick the aerie crowd
Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race
Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves,
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side
Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,
Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,
Though without number still amidst the Hall
Of that infernal Court.   But far within
And in thir own dimensions like themselves
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
In close recess and secret conclave sat
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,
Frequent and full.   After short silence then
And summons read, the great consult began.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45718/paradise-lost-book-1-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book  2 (1674 version),"HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far 
Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, 
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand 
Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold, 
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd 
To that bad eminence; and from despair 
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires 
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue 
Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught 
His proud imaginations thus displaid. 
 
Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n, 
For since no deep within her gulf can hold 
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, 
I give not Heav'n for lost.   From this descent 
Celestial vertues rising, will appear 
More glorious and more dread then from no fall, 
And trust themselves to fear no second fate: 
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n 
Did first create your Leader, next free choice, 
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, 
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss 
Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more 
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne 
Yielded with full consent.   The happier state 
In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw 
Envy from each inferior; but who here 
Will envy whom the highest place exposes 
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim 
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share 
Of endless pain? where there is then no good 
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there 
From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell 
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small 
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind 
Will covet more.   With this advantage then 
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, 
More then can be in Heav'n, we now return 
To claim our just inheritance of old, 
Surer to prosper then prosperity 
Could have assur'd us; and by what best way, 
Whether of open Warr or covert guile, 
We now debate; who can advise, may speak. 
 
He ceas'd, and next him Moloc, Scepter'd King 
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit 
That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair: 
His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd 
Equal in strength, and rather then be less 
Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost 
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse 
He reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake. 
 
My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, 
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those 
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. 
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, 
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait 
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here 
Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place 
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, 
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns 
By our delay? no, let us rather choose 
Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once 
O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way, 
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms 
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise 
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear 
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see 
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage 
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self 
Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, 
His own invented Torments.   But perhaps 
The way seems difficult and steep to scale 
With upright wing against a higher foe. 
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench 
Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still, 
That in our proper motion we ascend 
Up to our native seat: descent and fall 
To us is adverse.   Who but felt of late 
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear 
Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep, 
With what compulsion and laborious flight 
We sunk thus low?   Th' ascent is easie then; 
Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke 
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find 
To our destruction: if there be in Hell 
Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse 
Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd 
In this abhorred deep to utter woe; 
Where pain of unextinguishable fire 
Must exercise us without hope of end 
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge 
Inexorably, and the torturing hour 
Calls us to Penance?   More destroy'd then thus 
We should be quite abolisht and expire. 
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense 
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, 
Will either quite consume us, and reduce 
To nothing this essential, happier farr 
Then miserable to have eternal being: 
Or if our substance be indeed Divine, 
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst 
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel 
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n, 
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, 
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: 
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. 
 
He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd 
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous 
To less then Gods.   On th' other side up rose 
Belial, in act more graceful and humane; 
A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd 
For dignity compos'd and high exploit: 
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue 
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear 
The better reason, to perplex and dash 
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; 
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds 
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, 
And with perswasive accent thus began. 
 
I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, 
As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd 
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, 
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast 
Ominous conjecture on the whole success: 
When he who most excels in fact of Arms, 
In what he counsels and in what excels 
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair 
And utter dissolution, as the scope 
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. 
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd 
With Armed watch, that render all access 
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep 
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing 
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, 
Scorning surprize.   Or could we break our way 
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise 
With blackest Insurrection, to confound 
Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy 
All incorruptible would on his Throne 
Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould 
Incapable of stain would soon expel 
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire 
Victorious.   Thus repuls'd, our final hope 
Is flat despair: we must exasperate 
Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, 
And that must end us, that must be our cure, 
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, 
Though full of pain, this intellectual being, 
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, 
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost 
In the wide womb of uncreated night, 
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, 
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe 
Can give it, or will ever? how he can 
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. 
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, 
Belike through impotence, or unaware, 
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end 
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves 
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? 
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, 
Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; 
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, 
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, 
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? 
What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook 
With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought 
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd 
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay 
Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. 
What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires 
Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage 
And plunge us in the flames? or from above 
Should intermitted vengeance arm again 
His red right hand to plague us? what if all 
Her stores were open'd, and this Firmament 
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire 
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall 
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps 
Designing or exhorting glorious warr, 
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd 
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey 
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk 
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; 
There to converse with everlasting groans, 
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, 
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. 
Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike 
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile 
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye 
Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth 
All these our motions vain, sees and derides; 
Not more Almighty to resist our might 
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. 
Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of Heav'n 
Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here 
Chains and these Torments? better these then worse 
By my advice; since fate inevitable 
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, 
The Victors will.   To suffer, as to doe, 
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust 
That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, 
If we were wise, against so great a foe 
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. 
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold 
And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear 
What yet they know must follow, to endure 
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, 
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now 
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, 
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit 
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd 
Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd 
With what is punish't; whence these raging fires 
Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. 
Our purer essence then will overcome 
Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, 
Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd 
In temper and in nature, will receive 
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; 
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, 
Besides what hope the never-ending flight 
Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change 
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers 
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, 
If we procure not to our selves more woe. 
 
Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb 
Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, 
Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. 
 
Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n 
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain 
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then 
May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild 
To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife: 
The former vain to hope argues as vain 
The latter: for what place can be for us 
Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream 
We overpower?   Suppose he should relent 
And publish Grace to all, on promise made 
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we 
Stand in his presence humble, and receive 
Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne 
With warbl'd Hymns, and to his God head sing 
Forc't Halleluia's; while he Lordly sits 
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes 
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, 
Our servile offerings.   This must be our task 
In Heav'n this our delight; how wearisom 
Eternity so spent in worship paid 
To whom we hate.   Let us not then pursue 
By force impossible, by leave obtain'd 
Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state 
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek 
Our own good from our selves, and from our own 
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, 
Free, and to none accountable, preferring 
Hard liberty before the easie yoke 
Of servile Pomp.   Our greatness will appeer 
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, 
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse 
We can create, and in what place so e're 
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain 
Through labour and indurance.   This deep world 
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst 
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire 
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, 
And with the Majesty of darkness round 
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar 
Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? 
As he our darkness, cannot we his Light 
Imitate when we please? This Desart soile 
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; 
Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise 
Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? 
Our torments also may in length of time 
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires 
As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd 
Into their temper; which must needs remove 
The sensible of pain.   All things invite 
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State 
Of order, how in safety best we may 
Compose our present evils, with regard 
Of what we are and were, dismissing quite 
All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. 
 
He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld 
Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain 
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long 
Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull 
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance 
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay 
After the Tempest:   Such applause was heard 
As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, 
Advising peace: for such another Field 
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear 
Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael 
Wrought still within them; and no less desire 
To found this nether Empire, which might rise 
By pollicy, and long process of time, 
In emulation opposite to Heav'n. 
Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, 
Satan except, none higher sat, with grave 
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd 
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven 
Deliberation sat and public care; 
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, 
Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood 
With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear 
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look 
Drew audience and attention still as Night 
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. 
 
Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n 
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now 
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd 
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote 
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here 
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, 
And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd 
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat 
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt 
From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League 
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine 
In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, 
Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd 
His captive multitude: For he, be sure 
In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign 
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part 
By our revolt, but over Hell extend 
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule 
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. 
What sit we then projecting peace and Warr? 
Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss 
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none 
Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n 
To us enslav'd, but custody severe, 
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment 
Inflicted? and what peace can we return, 
But to our power hostility and hate, 
Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, 
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least 
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce 
In doing what we most in suffering feel? 
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need 
With dangerous expedition to invade 
Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, 
Or ambush from the Deep.   What if we find 
Some easier enterprize? There is a place 
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n 
Err not) another World, the happy seat 
Of some new Race call'd Man, about this time 
To be created like to us, though less 
In power and excellence, but favour'd more 
Of him who rules above; so was his will 
Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, 
That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. 
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn 
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, 
Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, 
And where thir weakness, how attempted best, 
By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, 
And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure 
In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd 
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left 
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps 
Som advantagious act may be achiev'd 
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire 
To waste his whole Creation, or possess 
All as our own, and drive as we were driven, 
The punie habitants, or if not drive, 
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God 
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand 
Abolish his own works.   This would surpass 
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy 
In our Confusion, and our joy upraise 
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons 
HurI'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse 
Thir frail Original, and faded bliss, 
Faded so soon.   Advise if this be worth 
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here 
Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub 
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd 
By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, 
But from the Author of all ill could Spring 
So deep a malice, to confound the race 
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell 
To mingle and involve, done all to spite 
The great Creatour?   But thir spite still serves 
His glory to augment.   The bold design 
Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy 
Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent 
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. 
 
Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, 
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, 
Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep 
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, 
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view 
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms 
And opportune excursion we may chance 
Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone 
Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light 
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam 
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, 
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires 
Shall breathe her balme.   But first whom shall we send 
In search of this new world, whom shall we find 
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet 
The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss 
And through the palpable obscure find out 
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight 
Upborn with indefatigable wings 
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive 
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then 
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe 
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick 
Of Angels watching round?   Here he had need 
All circumspection, and we now no less 
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, 
The weight of all and our last hope relies. 
 
This said, he sat; and expectation held 
His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd 
To second, or oppose, or undertake 
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, 
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each 
In others count'nance read his own dismay 
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime 
Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found 
So hardie as to proffer or accept 
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last 
Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd 
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride 
Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. 
 
O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, 
With reason hath deep silence and demurr 
Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way 
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; 
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, 
Outrageous to devour, immures us round 
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant 
Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. 
These past, if any pass, the void profound 
Of unessential Night receives him next 
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being 
Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. 
If thence he scape into whatever world, 
Or unknown Region, what remains him less 
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. 
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, 
And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd 
With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd 
And judg'd of public moment, in the shape 
Of difficulty or danger could deterr 
Mee from attempting.   Wherefore do I assume 
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, 
Refusing to accept as great a share 
Of hazard as of honour, due alike 
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due 
Of hazard more, as he above the rest 
High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty Powers, 
Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, 
While here shall be our home, what best may ease 
The present misery, and render Hell 
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm 
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain 
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch 
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad 
Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek 
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize 
None shall partake with me.   Thus saying rose 
The Monarch, and prevented all reply, 
Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd 
Others among the chief might offer now 
(Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; 
And so refus'd might in opinion stand 
His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute 
Which he through hazard huge must earn.   But they 
Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice 
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; 
Thir rising all at once was as the sound 
Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend 
With awful reverence prone; and as a God 
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: 
Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, 
That for the general safety he despis'd 
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd 
Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast 
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, 
Or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. 
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark 
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: 
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds 
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread 
Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element 
Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; 
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet 
Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, 
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds 
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. 
O shame to men!   Devil with Devil damn'd 
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree 
Of Creatures rational, though under hope 
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, 
Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife 
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, 
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: 
As if (which might induce us to accord) 
Man had not hellish foes anow besides, 
That day and night for his destruction waite. 
 
The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth 
In order came the grand infernal Peers, 
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd 
Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less 
Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, 
And God-like imitated State; him round 
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd 
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. 
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry 
With Trumpets regal sound the great result: 
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim 
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie 
By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss 
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell 
With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. 
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd 
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers 
Disband, and wandring, each his several way 
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice 
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find 
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain 
The irksom hours, till this great Chief return. 
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime 
Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend, 
As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; 
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal 
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. 
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears 
Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush 
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van 
Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears 
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms 
From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. 
Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell 
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air 
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. 
As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown'd 
With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore 
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, 
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw 
Into th' Euboic Sea.   Others more milde, 
Retreated in a silent valley, sing 
With notes Angelical to many a Harp 
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall 
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate 
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. 
Thir Song was partial, but the harmony 
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) 
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment 
The thronging audience.   In discourse more sweet 
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) 
Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, 
In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high 
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate, 
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, 
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. 
Of good and evil much they argu'd then, 
Of happiness and final misery, 
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, 
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: 
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm 
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite 
Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest 
With stubborn patience as with triple steel. 
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, 
On bold adventure to discover wide 
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps 
Might yield them easier habitation, bend 
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks 
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge 
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; 
Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, 
Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; 
Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud 
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton 
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. 
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, 
Lethe the River of Oblivion roules 
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, 
Forthwith his former state and being forgets, 
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. 
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent 
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms 
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land 
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems 
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, 
A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog 
Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, 
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air 
Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. 
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, 
At certain revolutions all the damn'd 
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change 
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, 
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice 
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine 
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, 
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. 
They ferry over this Lethean Sound 
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, 
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach 
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose 
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, 
All in one moment, and so neer the brink; 
But Fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt 
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards 
The Ford, and of it self the water flies 
All taste of living wight, as once it fled 
The lip of Tantalus.   Thus roving on 
In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands 
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast 
View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found 
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile 
They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, 
O're many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, 
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, 
A Universe of death, which God by curse 
Created evil, for evil only good, 
Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, 
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, 
Abominable, inutterable, and worse 
Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, 
Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. 
 
Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, 
Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, 
Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell 
Explores his solitary flight; som times 
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, 
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares 
Up to the fiery Concave touring high. 
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd 
Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds 
Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles 
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring 
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood 
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape 
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.   So seem'd 
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer 
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, 
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, 
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, 
Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, 
Yet unconsum'd.   Before the Gates there sat 
On either side a formidable shape; 
The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, 
But ended foul in many a scaly fould 
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd 
With mortal sting: about her middle round 
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd 
With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung 
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, 
If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, 
And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, 
Within unseen.   Farr less abhorrd than these 
Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts 
Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: 
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd 
In secret, riding through the Air she comes 
Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance 
With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon 
Eclipses at thir charms.   The other shape, 
If shape it might be call'd that shape had none 
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, 
Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, 
For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, 
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, 
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head 
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. 
Satan was now at hand, and from his seat 
The Monster moving onward came as fast 
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. 
Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, 
Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, 
Created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; 
And with disdainful look thus first began. 
 
Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, 
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance 
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way 
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, 
That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: 
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, 
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. 
 
To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, 
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, 
Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then 
Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms 
Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons 
Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou 
And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd 
To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? 
And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, 
Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn 
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, 
Thy King and Lord?   Back to thy punishment, 
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, 
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue 
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart 
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. 
 
So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, 
So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold 
More dreadful and deform: on th' other side 
Incenst with indignation Satan stood 
Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, 
That fires the length of Ophiucus huge 
In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair 
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.   Each at the Head 
Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands 
No second stroke intend, and such a frown 
Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds 
With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on 
Over the Caspian, then stand front to front 
Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow 
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: 
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell 
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; 
For never but once more was either like 
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds 
Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, 
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat 
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, 
Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. 
 
O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, 
Against thy only Son?   What fury O Son, 
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart 
Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; 
For him who sits above and laughs the while 
At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute 
What e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, 
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. 
 
She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest 
Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: 
 
So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange 
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand 
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds 
What it intends; till first I know of thee, 
What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why 
In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st 
Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11'st my Son? 
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now 
Sight more detestable then him and thee. 
 
T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; 
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem 
Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair 
In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight 
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd 
In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, 
All on a sudden miserable pain 
Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm 
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast 
Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, 
Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, 
Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd 
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd 
All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid 
At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign 
Portentous held me; but familiar grown, 
I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won 
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft 
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing 
Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st 
With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd 
A growing burden.   Mean while Warr arose, 
And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind 
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe 
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout 
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell 
Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down 
Into this Deep, and in the general fall 
I also; at which time this powerful Key 
Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep 
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass 
Without my op'ning.   Pensive here I sat 
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb 
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown 
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. 
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest 
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way 
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain 
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew 
Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie 
Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart 
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; 
Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd 
From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. 
I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, 
Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, 
Mee overtook his mother all dismaid, 
And in embraces forcible and foule 
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot 
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry 
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd 
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite 
To me, for when they list into the womb 
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw 
My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth 
A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, 
That rest or intermission none I find. 
Before mine eyes in opposition sits 
Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, 
And me his Parent would full soon devour 
For want of other prey, but that he knows 
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I 
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, 
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. 
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun 
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope 
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, 
Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, 
Save he who reigns above, none can resist. 
 
She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore 
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. 
Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, 
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge 
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys 
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change 
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know 
I come no enemie, but to set free 
From out this dark and dismal house of pain, 
Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host 
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd 
Fell with us from on high: from them I go 
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all 
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread 
Th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense 
To search with wandring quest a place foretold 
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now 
Created vast and round, a place of bliss 
In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't 
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply 
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, 
Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude 
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught 
Then this more secret now design'd, I haste 
To know, and this once known, shall soon return, 
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death 
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen 
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd 
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd 
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. 
He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death 
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear 
His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe 
Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd 
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. 
 
The key of this infernal Pit by due, 
And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King 
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock 
These Adamantine Gates; against all force 
Death ready stands to interpose his dart, 
Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. 
But what ow I to his commands above 
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down 
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, 
To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, 
Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, 
Here in perpetual agonie and pain, 
With terrors and with clamors compasst round 
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: 
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou 
My being gav'st me; whom should I obey 
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon 
To that new world of light and bliss, among 
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign 
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems 
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. 
 
Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, 
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; 
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, 
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, 
Which but her self not all the Stygian powers 
Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns 
Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar 
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease 
Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie 
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound 
Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate 
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook 
Of Erebus.   She op'nd, but to shut 
Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, 
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host 
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through 
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; 
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth 
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. 
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear 
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark 
Illimitable Ocean without bound, 
Without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, 
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night 
And Chaos.   Ancestors of Nature, hold 
Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise 
Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand. 
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce 
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring 
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag 
Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, 
Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, 
Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands 
Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, 
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise 
Thir lighter wings.   To whom these most adhere, 
Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, 
And by decision more imbroiles the fray 
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter 
Chance governs all.   Into this wilde Abyss, 
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, 
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, 
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt 
Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, 
Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain 
His dark materials to create more Worlds, 
Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend 
Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, 
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith 
He had to cross.   Nor was his eare less peal'd 
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare 
Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, 
With all her battering Engines bent to rase 
Som Capital City; or less then if this frame 
Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements 
In mutinie had from her Axle torn 
The stedfast Earth.   At last his Sail-broad Vannes 
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak 
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League 
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides 
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets 
A vast vacuitie: all unawares 
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops 
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour 
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance 
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud 
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him 
As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, 
Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, 
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, 
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, 
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. 
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness 
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, 
Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth 
Had from his wakeful custody purloind 
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend 
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, 
With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, 
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: 
At length a universal hubbub wilde 
Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd 
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare 
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, 
Undaunted to meet there what ever power 
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss 
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask 
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes 
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne 
Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread 
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd 
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, 
The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood 
Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name 
Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, 
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, 
And Discord with a thousand various mouths. 
 
T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers 
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, 
Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, 
With purpose to explore or to disturb 
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint 
Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way, 
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, 
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek 
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds 
Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place 
From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King 
Possesses lately, thither to arrive 
I travel this profound, direct my course; 
Directed no mean recompence it brings 
To your behoof, if I that Region lost, 
All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce 
To her original darkness and your sway 
(Which is my present journey) and once more 
Erect the Standard there of ancient Night; 
Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. 
 
Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old 
With faultring speech and visage incompos'd 
Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, 
That mighty leading Angel, who of late 
Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. 
I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host 
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep 
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, 
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates 
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands 
Pursuing.   I upon my Frontieres here 
Keep residence; if all I can will serve, 
That little which is left so to defend, 
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles 
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell 
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; 
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World 
Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain 
To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: 
If that way be your walk, you have not farr; 
So much the neerer danger; go and speed; 
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. 
 
He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply, 
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, 
With fresh alacritie and force renew'd 
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire 
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock 
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round 
Environ'd wins his way; harder beset 
And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd 
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: 
Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd 
Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. 
So he with difficulty and labour hard 
Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; 
But hee once past, soon after when man fell, 
Strange alteration!   Sin and Death amain 
Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, 
Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way 
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf 
Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length 
From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe 
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse 
With easie intercourse pass to and fro 
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom 
God and good Angels guard by special grace. 
But now at last the sacred influence 
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n 
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night 
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins 
Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire 
As from her outmost works a brok'd foe 
With tumult less and with less hostile din, 
That Satan with less toil, and now with ease 
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light 
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds 
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; 
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, 
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold 
Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide 
In circuit, undetermind square or round, 
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd 
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; 
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain 
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr 
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.

John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book  3 (1674 version),"HAil holy Light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born, 
Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam 
May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light, 
And never but in unapproached light 
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, 
Bright effluence of bright essence increate. 
Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, 
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, 
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice 
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest 
The rising world of waters dark and deep, 
Won from the void and formless infinite. 
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, 
Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd 
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight 
Through utter and through middle darkness borne 
With other notes then to th' Orphean Lyre 
I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, 
Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down 
The dark descent, and up to reascend, 
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, 
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou 
Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain 
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; 
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, 
Or dim suffusion veild.   Yet not the more 
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt 
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, 
Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief 
Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath 
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, 
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget 
Those other two equal'd with me in Fate, 
So were I equal'd with them in renown, 
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, 
And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old. 
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move 
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird 
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid 
Tunes her nocturnal Note.   Thus with the Year 
Seasons return, but not to me returns 
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn, 
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, 
Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine; 
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark 
Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men 
Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair 
Presented with a Universal blanc 
Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd, 
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. 
So much the rather thou Celestial light 
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers 
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence 
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell 
Of things invisible to mortal sight. 
 
Now had the Almighty Father from above, 
From the pure Empyrean where he sits 
High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, 
His own works and their works at once to view: 
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven 
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd 
Beatitude past utterance; on his right 
The radiant image of his Glory sat, 
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld 
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two 
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't, 
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, 
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love 
In blissful solitude; he then survey'd 
Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there 
Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night 
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now 
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet 
On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd 
Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament, 
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. 
Him God beholding from his prospect high, 
Wherein past, present, future he beholds, 
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. 
 
Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage 
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds 
Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains 
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss 
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems 
On desparate reveng, that shall redound 
Upon his own rebellious head.   And now 
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way 
Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light, 
Directly towards the new created World, 
And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay 
If him by force he can destroy, or worse, 
By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert 
For man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, 
And easily transgress the sole Command, 
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall, 
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? 
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee 
All he could have; I made him just and right, 
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. 
Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers 
And Spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; 
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. 
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere 
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, 
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, 
Not what they would? what praise could they receive? 
What pleasure I from such obedience paid, 
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) 
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, 
Made passive both, had servd necessitie, 
Not mee.   They therefore as to right belongd, 
So were created, nor can justly accuse 
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate, 
As if predestination over-rul'd 
Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree 
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed 
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, 
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, 
Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. 
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, 
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, 
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all 
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so 
I formd them free, and free they must remain, 
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change 
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree 
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd 
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. 
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, 
Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd 
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, 
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, 
Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, 
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. 
 
Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd 
All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect 
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: 
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen 
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon 
Substantially express'd, and in his face 
Divine compassion visibly appeerd, 
Love without end, and without measure Grace, 
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. 
 
O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd 
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; 
For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll 
Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound 
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne 
Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. 
For should Man finally be lost, should Man 
Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son 
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd 
With his own folly? that be from thee farr, 
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg 
Of all things made, and judgest onely right. 
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain 
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill 
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, 
Or proud return though to his heavier doom, 
Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell 
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, 
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self 
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, 
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? 
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both 
Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. 
 
To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd. 
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, 
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone 
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, 
All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all 
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: 
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, 
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me 
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew 
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd 
By sin to foul exorbitant desires; 
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand 
On even ground against his mortal foe, 
By me upheld, that he may know how frail 
His fall'n condition is, and to me ow 
All his deliv'rance, and to none but me. 
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace 
Elect above the rest; so is my will: 
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd 
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes 
Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace 
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, 
What may sufflce, and soft'n stonie hearts 
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. 
To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due, 
Though but endevord with sincere intent, 
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. 
And I will place within them as a guide 
My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, 
Light after light well us'd they shall attain, 
And to the end persisting, safe arrive. 
This my long sufferance and my day of grace 
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; 
But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, 
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; 
And none but such from mercy I exclude. 
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, 
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns 
Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n, 
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, 
To expiate his Treason hath naught left, 
But to destruction sacred and devote, 
He with his whole posteritie must dye, 
Dye hee or Justice must; unless for him 
Som other able, and as willing, pay 
The rigid satisfaction, death for death. 
Say Heav'nly powers, where shall we find such love, 
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem 
Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, 
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? 
 
He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute, 
And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf 
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, 
Much less that durst upon his own head draw 
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. 
And now without redemption all mankind 
Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell 
By doom severe, had not the Son of God, 
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, 
His dearest mediation thus renewd. 
 
Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; 
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, 
The speediest of thy winged messengers, 
To visit all thy creatures, and to all 
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, 
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide 
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; 
Attonement for himself or offering meet, 
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: 
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life 
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; 
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave 
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee 
Freely put off, and for him lastly dye 
Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage; 
Under his gloomie power I shall not long 
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess 
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, 
Though now to Death I yield, and am his due 
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, 
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave 
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule 
For ever with corruption there to dwell; 
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue 
My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; 
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop 
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. 
I through the ample Air in Triumph high 
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show 
The powers of darkness bound.   Thou at the sight 
Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, 
While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes, 
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: 
Then with the multitude of my redeemd 
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, 
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud 
Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, 
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more 
Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. 
 
His words here ended, but his meek aspect 
Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love 
To mortal men, above which only shon 
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice 
Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will 
Of his great Father.   Admiration seis'd 
All Heav'n, what this might mean, and whither tend 
Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd: 
 
O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace 
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou 
My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, 
To me are all my works, nor Man the least 
Though last created, that for him I spare 
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, 
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. 
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, 
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn; 
And be thy self Man among men on Earth, 
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, 
By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room 
The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. 
As in him perish all men, so in thee 
As from a second root shall be restor'd, 
As many as are restor'd, without thee none. 
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit 
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce 
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, 
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee 
Receive new life.   So Man, as is most just, 
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die, 
And dying rise, and rising with him raise 
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. 
So Heav'nly love shall outdoo Hellish hate 
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, 
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate 
So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes 
In those who, when they may, accept not grace. 
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume 
Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. 
Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss 
Equal to God, and equally enjoying 
God-like fruition, quitted all to save 
A World from utter loss, and hast been found 
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, 
Found worthiest to be so by being Good, 
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee 
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, 
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt 
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; 
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign 
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, 
Anointed universal King, all Power 
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume 
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream 
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: 
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide 
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; 
When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n 
Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send 
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime 
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes 
The living, and forthwith the cited dead 
Of all past Ages to the general Doom 
Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. 
Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge 
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink 
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, 
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.   Mean while 
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring 
New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, 
And after all thir tribulations long 
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, 
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. 
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, 
For regal Scepter then no more shall need, 
God shall be All in All.   But all ye Gods, 
Adore him, who to compass all this dies, 
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. 
 
No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all 
The multitude of Angels with a shout 
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet 
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung 
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld 
Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent 
Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground 
With solemn adoration down they cast 
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, 
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once 
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life 
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence 
To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, 
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, 
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn 
Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber stream; 
With these that never fade the Spirits elect 
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, 
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright 
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon 
Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. 
Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, 
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side 
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet 
Of charming symphonie they introduce 
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; 
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine 
Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n. 
 
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, 
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, 
Eternal King; thee Author of all being, 
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible 
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st 
Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st 
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud 
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, 
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, 
Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim 
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. 
Thee next they sang of all Creation first, 
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, 
In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud 
Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines, 
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee 
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, 
Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. 
Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein 
By thee created, and by thee threw down 
Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day 
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, 
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook 
Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks 
Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid. 
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime 
Thee only extoll'd, Son of thy Fathers might, 
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, 
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n, 
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome 
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: 
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son 
Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man 
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, 
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife 
Of Mercy and justice in thy face discern'd, 
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat 
Second to thee, offerd himself to die 
For mans offence.   O unexampl'd love, 
Love no where to be found less then Divine! 
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name 
Shall be the copious matter of my Song 
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise 
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. 
 
Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, 
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. 
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe 
Of this round World, whose first convex divides 
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd 
From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old, 
Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off 
It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent 
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night 
Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms 
Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; 
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n 
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines 
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: 
Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field. 
As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, 
Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, 
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey 
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids 
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs 
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; 
But in his way lights on the barren Plaines 
Of Sericana, where Chineses drive 
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: 
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend 
Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, 
Alone, for other Creature in this place 
Living or liveless to be found was none, 
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth 
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew 
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin 
With vanity had filld the works of men: 
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things 
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, 
Or happiness in this or th' other life; 
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits 
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, 
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find 
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; 
All th, unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, 
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, 
Dissolvd on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 
Till final dissolution, wander here, 
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; 
Those argent Fields more likely habitants, 
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold 
Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: 
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born 
First from the ancient World those Giants came 
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: 
The builders next of Babel on the Plain 
Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe 
New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: 
Others came single; he who to be deemd 
A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna flames, 
Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy 
Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea, 
Cleombrotus, and many more too long, 
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers 
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. 
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek 
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n; 
And they who to be sure of Paradise 
Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, 
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd; 
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, 
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs 
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; 
And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems 
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot 
Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe 
A violent cross wind from either Coast 
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry 
Into the devious Air; then might ye see 
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost 
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, 
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, 
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft 
Fly o're the backside of the World farr off 
Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld 
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown 
Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; 
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, 
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame 
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste 
His travell'd steps; farr distant he descries 
Ascending by degrees magnificent 
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, 
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd 
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate 
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold 
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes 
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth 
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. 
The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 
Angels ascending and descending, bands 
Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled 
To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz, 
Dreaming by night under the open Skie, 
And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. 
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood 
There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes 
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd 
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon 
Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, 
Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake 
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. 
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare 
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate 
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. 
Direct against which op'nd from beneath, 
Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, 
A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, 
Wider by farr then that of after-times 
Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, 
Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, 
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, 
On high behests his Angels to and fro 
Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard 
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood 
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land 
Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; 
So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set 
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. 
Satan from hence now on the lower stair 
That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate 
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view 
Of all this World at once.   As when a Scout 
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone 
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne 
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, 
Which to his eye discovers unaware 
The goodly prospect of some forein land 
First-seen, or some renown'd Metropolis 
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, 
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. 
Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, 
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd 
At sight of all this World beheld so faire. 
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood 
So high above the circling Canopie 
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point 
Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears 
Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas 
Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole 
He views in bredth, and without longer pause 
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws 
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease 
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way 
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon 
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, 
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, 
Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, 
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, 
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there 
He stayd not to enquire: above them all 
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven 
Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends 
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe 
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, 
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie 
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, 
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, 
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move 
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute 
Days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing Lamp 
Turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd 
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms 
The Univers, and to each inward part 
With gentle penetration, though unseen, 
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: 
So wondrously was set his Station bright. 
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps 
Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe 
Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. 
The place he found beyond expression bright, 
Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; 
Not all parts like, but all alike informd 
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; 
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; 
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, 
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon 
In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides 
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, 
That stone, or like to that which here below 
Philosophers in vain so long have sought, 
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde 
Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound 
In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, 
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. 
What wonder then if fields and regions here 
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run 
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch 
Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote 
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt 
Here in the dark so many precious things 
Of colour glorious and effect so rare? 
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met 
Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, 
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, 
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon 
Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now 
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round 
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, 
No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray 
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon 
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, 
The same whom John saw also in the Sun: 
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; 
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar 
Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind 
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings 
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd 
He seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. 
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope 
To find who might direct his wandring flight 
To Paradise the happie seat of Man, 
His journies end and our beginning woe. 
But first he casts to change his proper shape, 
Which else might work him danger or delay: 
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, 
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face 
Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb 
Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; 
Under a Coronet his flowing haire 
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore 
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, 
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held 
Before his decent steps a Silver wand. 
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, 
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, 
Admonisht by his ear, and strait was known 
Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n 
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne 
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes 
That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth 
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, 
O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; 
 
Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand 
In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, 
The first art wont his great authentic will 
Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, 
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; 
And here art likeliest by supream decree 
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye 
To visit oft this new Creation round; 
Unspeakable desire to see, and know 
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, 
His chief delight and favour, him for whom 
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, 
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim 
Alone thus wandring.   Brightest Seraph tell 
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man 
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, 
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; 
That I may find him, and with secret gaze, 
Or open admiration him behold 
On whom the great Creator hath bestowd 
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; 
That both in him and all things, as is meet, 
The Universal Maker we may praise; 
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes 
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss 
Created this new happie Race of Men 
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. 
 
So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; 
For neither Man nor Angel can discern 
Hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks 
Invisible, except to God alone, 
By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: 
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps 
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie 
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill 
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd 
Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held 
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; 
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule 
In his uprightness answer thus returnd. 
Fair Angel, thy desire which tends to know 
The works of God, thereby to glorifie 
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess 
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise 
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither 
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, 
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps 
Contented with report hear onely in heav'n: 
For wonderful indeed are all his works, 
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all 
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; 
But what created mind can comprehend 
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite 
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. 
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, 
This worlds material mould, came to a heap: 
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar 
Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; 
Till at his second bidding darkness fled, 
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: 
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then 
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, 
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n 
Flew upward, spirited with various forms, 
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs 
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; 
Each had his place appointed, each his course, 
The rest in circuit walles this Universe. 
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side 
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; 
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light 
His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere 
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon 
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide 
Timely interposes, and her monthly round 
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; 
With borrowd light her countenance triform 
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, 
And in her pale dominion checks the night. 
That spot to which I point is Paradise, 
Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. 
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. 
 
Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, 
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, 
Where honour due and reverence none neglects, 
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, 
Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, 
Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele, 
Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45739/paradise-lost-book-3-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book  4 (1674 version),"O For that warning voice, which he who saw 
Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, 
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, 
Came furious down to be reveng'd on men, 
Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now, 
While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd 
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd 
Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now 
Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, 
The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, 
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss 
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: 
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, 
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, 
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth 
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, 
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles 
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract 
His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr 
The Hell within him, for within him Hell 
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell 
One step no more then from himself can fly 
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair 
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie 
Of what he was, what is, and what must be 
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. 
Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view 
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, 
Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun, 
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: 
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. 
 
O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, 
Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God 
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs 
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, 
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name 
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams 
That bring to my remembrance from what state 
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; 
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down 
Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King: 
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return 
From me, whom he created what I was 
In that bright eminence, and with his good 
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. 
What could be less then to afford him praise, 
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, 
How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, 
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high 
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher 
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit 
The debt immense of endless gratitude, 
So burthensome still paying, still to ow; 
Forgetful what from him I still receivd, 
And understood not that a grateful mind 
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once 
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? 
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind 
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood 
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd 
Ambition.   Yet why not? som other Power 
As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean 
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great 
Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within 
Or from without, to all temptations arm'd. 
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? 
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, 
But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all? 
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, 
To me alike, it deals eternal woe. 
Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will 
Chose freely what it now so justly rues. 
Me miserable! which way shall I flie 
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? 
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; 
And in the lowest deep a lower deep 
Still threatning to devour me opens wide, 
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n. 
O then at last relent: is there no place 
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? 
None left but by submission; and that word 
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame 
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd 
With other promises and other vaunts 
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue 
Th' Omnipotent.   Ay me, they little know 
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, 
Under what torments inwardly I groane; 
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, 
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd 
The lower still I fall, onely Supream 
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. 
But say I could repent and could obtaine 
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon 
Would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay 
What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant 
Vows made in pain, as violent and void. 
For never can true reconcilement grow 
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: 
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare 
Short intermission bought with double smart. 
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr 
From granting hee, as I from begging peace: 
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead 
Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, 
Mankind created, and for him this World. 
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, 
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; 
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least 
Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold 
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; 
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. 
 
Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face 
Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, 
Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid 
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. 
For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule 
Are ever cleer.   Whereof hee soon aware, 
Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, 
Artificer of fraud; and was the first 
That practisd falshood under saintly shew, 
Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: 
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive 
Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down 
The way he went, and on th' Assyrian mount 
Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall 
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce 
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, 
As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. 
So on he fares, and to the border comes, 
Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, 
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, 
As with a rural mound the champain head 
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides 
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, 
Access deni'd; and over head up grew 
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, 
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, 
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend 
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre 
Of stateliest view.   Yet higher then thir tops 
The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: 
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large 
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. 
And higher then that Wall a circling row 
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, 
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue 
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: 
On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams 
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, 
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd 
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire 
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires 
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive 
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales 
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense 
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole 
Those balmie spoiles.   As when to them who saile 
Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past 
Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow 
Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare 
Of Arabie the blest, with such delay 
Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League 
Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. 
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend 
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd 
Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, 
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse 
Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent 
From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound. 
 
Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill 
Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; 
But further way found none, so thick entwin'd, 
As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth 
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext 
All path of Man or Beast that past that way: 
One Gate there only was, and that look'd East 
On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw 
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, 
At one slight bound high over leap'd all bound 
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within 
Lights on his feet.   As when a prowling Wolfe, 
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, 
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve 
In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure, 
Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:. 
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash 
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, 
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, 
In at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; 
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: 
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. 
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, 
The middle Tree and highest there that grew, 
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life 
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death 
To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought 
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd 
For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge 
Of immortality.   So little knows 
Any, but God alone, to value right 
The good before him, but perverts best things 
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. 
Beneath him with new wonder now he views 
To all delight of human sense expos'd 
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, 
A Heav'n on Earth, for blissful Paradise 
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East 
Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line 
From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs 
Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, 
Or where the Sons of Eden long before 
Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile 
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; 
Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow 
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; 
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, 
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit 
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life 
Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by, 
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. 
Southward through Eden went a River large, 
Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill 
Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown 
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd 
Upon the rapid current, which through veins 
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, 
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill 
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell 
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, 
Which from his darksom passage now appeers, 
And now divided into four main Streams, 
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme 
And Country whereof here needs no account, 
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, 
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, 
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, 
With mazie error under pendant shades 
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed 
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art 
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon 
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, 
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote 
The open field, and where the unpierc't shade 
lmbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, 
A happy rural seat of various view; 
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, 
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde 
Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, 
If true, here only, and of delicious taste: 
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks 
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, 
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap 
Of som irriguous Valley spred her store, 
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: 
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves 
Of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine 
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps 
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall 
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, 
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, 
Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. 
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, 
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune 
The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan 
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance 
Led on th' Eternal Spring.   Not that faire field 
Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours 
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis 
Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain 
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove 
Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd 
Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise 
Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile 
Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, 
Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove, 
Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son 
Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye; 
Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, 
Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd 
True Paradise under the Ethiop Line 
By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock, 
A whole days journy high, but wide remote 
From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend 
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind 
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: 
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, 
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad 
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, 
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine 
The image of thir glorious Maker shon, 
Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, 
Severe but in true filial freedom plac't; 
Whence true autoritie in men; though both 
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; 
For contemplation hee and valour formd, 
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, 
Hee for God only, shee for God in him: 
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd 
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks 
Round from his parted forelock manly hung 
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: 
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste 
Her unadorned golden tresses wore 
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd 
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd 
Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, 
And by her yielded, by him best receivd, 
Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, 
And sweet reluctant amorous delay. 
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, 
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame 
Of natures works, honor dishonorable, 
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind 
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, 
And banisht from mans life his happiest life, 
Simplicitie and spotless innocence. 
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight 
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: 
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair 
That ever since in loves imbraces met, 
Adam the goodliest man of men since borne 
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. 
Under a tuft of shade that on a green 
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side 
They sat them down, and after no more toil 
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd 
To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease 
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite 
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, 
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes 
Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline 
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: 
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde 
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; 
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles 
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems 
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, 
Alone as they.   About them frisking playd 
All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase 
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; 
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw 
Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards, 
Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant 
To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd 
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly 
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine 
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile 
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass 
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, 
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun 
Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer 
To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale 
Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: 
When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, 
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. 
 
O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, 
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't 
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, 
Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright 
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue 
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines 
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace 
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. 
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh 
Your change approaches, when all these delights 
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, 
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; 
Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd 
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n 
Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe 
As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe 
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne 
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, 
And mutual amitie so streight, so close, 
That I with you must dwell, or you with me 
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please 
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such 
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, 
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold, 
To entertain you two, her widest Gates, 
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, 
Not like these narrow limits, to receive 
ass Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, 
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge 
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. 
And should I at your harmless innocence 
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, 
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd, 
By conquering this new World, compels me now 
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. 
 
So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, 
The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. 
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree 
Down he alights among the sportful Herd 
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, 
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end 
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd 
To mark what of thir state he more might learn 
By word or action markt: about them round 
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, 
Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi'd 
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, 
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft 
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground 
Whence rushing he might surest seize them both 
Grip't in each paw: When Adam first of men 
To first of women Eve thus moving speech, 
Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. 
 
Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, 
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the power 
That made us, and for us this ample World 
Be infinitly good, and of his good 
As liberal and free as infinite, 
That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here 
In all this happiness, who at his hand 
Have nothing merited, nor can performe 
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires 
From us no other service then to keep 
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees 
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit 
So various, not to taste that onely Tree 
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, 
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, 
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst 
God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree, 
The only sign of our obedience left 
Among so many signes of power and rule 
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n 
Over all other Creatures that possess 
Earth, Aire, and Sea.   Then let us not think hard 
One easie prohibition, who enjoy 
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice 
Unlimited of manifold delights: 
But let us ever praise him, and extoll 
His bountie, following our delightful task 
To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours, 
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. 
 
To whom thus Eve repli'd.   O thou for whom 
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, 
And without whom am to no end, my Guide 
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. 
For wee to him indeed all praises owe, 
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy 
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee 
Praeeminent by so much odds, while thou 
Like consort to thy self canst no where find. 
That day I oft remember, when from sleep 
I first awak't, and found my self repos'd 
Under a shade of flours, much wondring where 
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. 
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread 
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd 
Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went 
With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe 
On the green bank, to look into the cleer 
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. 
As I bent down to look, just opposite, 
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd 
Bending to look on me, I started back, 
It started back, but pleas'd I soon returnd, 
Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks 
Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt 
Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, 
Had not a voice thus warnd me,   What thou seest, 
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, 
With thee it came and goes: but follow me, 
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies 
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee 
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy 
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare 
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd 
Mother of human Race: what could I doe, 
But follow strait, invisibly thus led? 
Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, 
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, 
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, 
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, 
Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return faire Eve, 
Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, 
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent 
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart 
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side 
Henceforth an individual solace dear; 
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim 
My other half: with that thy gentle hand 
Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see 
How beauty is excelld by manly grace 
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 
 
So spake our general Mother, and with eyes 
Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, 
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand 
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast 
Naked met his under the flowing Gold 
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight 
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms 
Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter 
On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds 
That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip 
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd 
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne 
Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. 
 
Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two 
Imparadis't in one anothers arms 
The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill 
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, 
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, 
Among our other torments not the least, 
Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; 
Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd 
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: 
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd, 
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n? 
Suspicious, reasonless.   Why should thir Lord 
Envie them that? can it be sin to know, 
Can it be death? and do they onely stand 
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, 
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? 
O fair foundation laid whereon to build 
Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds 
With more desire to know, and to reject 
Envious commands, invented with designe 
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt 
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, 
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? 
But first with narrow search I must walk round 
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; 
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet 
Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side, 
Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw 
What further would be learnt.   Live while ye may, 
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, 
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. 
 
So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, 
But with sly circumspection, and began 
Through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. 
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n 
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun 
Slowly descended, and with right aspect 
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise 
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock 
Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, 
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent 
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; 
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung 
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. 
Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat 
Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night; 
About him exercis'd Heroic Games 
Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand 
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares, 
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. 
Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven 
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr 
In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd 
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner 
From what point of his Compass to beware 
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. 
 
Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv'n 
Charge and strict watch that to this happie Place 
No evil thing approach or enter in; 
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare 
A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know 
More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man 
Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way 
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; 
But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, 
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks 
Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: 
Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade 
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew 
I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise 
New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 
 
To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: 
Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, 
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, 
See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass 
The vigilance here plac't, but such as come 
Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour 
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, 
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds 
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude 
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. 
But if within the circuit of these walks, 
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom 
Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know. 
 
So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge 
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd 
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n 
Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb, 
Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd 
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth 
By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there 
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold 
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: 
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray 
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; 
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, 
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests 
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; 
She all night long her amorous descant sung; 
Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament 
With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led 
The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon 
Rising in clouded Majestie, at length 
Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, 
And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. 
 
When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour 
Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest 
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set 
Labour and rest, as day and night to men 
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep 
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines 
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long 
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; 
Man hath his daily work of body or mind 
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, 
And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies; 
While other Animals unactive range, 
And of thir doings God takes no account. 
To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East 
With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, 
And at our pleasant labour, to reform 
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, 
Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, 
That mock our scant manuring, and require 
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: 
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, 
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, 
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; 
Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. 
 
To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. 
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst 
Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains, 
God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more 
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. 
With thee conversing I forget all time, 
All seasons and thir change, all please alike. 
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, 
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun 
When first on this delightful Land he spreads 
His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, 
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth 
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on 
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night 
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, 
And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train: 
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends 
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun 
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, 
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, 
Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night 
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, 
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. 
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom 
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? 
 
To whom our general Ancestor repli'd. 
Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, 
Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, 
By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land 
In order, though to Nations yet unborn, 
Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; 
Least total darkness should by Night regaine 
Her old possession, and extinguish life 
In Nature and all things, which these soft fires 
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate 
Of various influence foment and warme, 
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down 
Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow 
On Earth, made hereby apter to receive 
Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. 
These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, 
Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, 
That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; 
Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth 
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. 
All these with ceasless praise his works behold 
Both day and night: how often from the steep 
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard 
Celestial voices to the midnight air, 
Sole, or responsive each to others note 
Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands 
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk 
With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds 
In full harmonic number joind, thir songs 
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. 
 
Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd 
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place 
Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd 
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe 
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade 
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew 
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side 
Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub 
Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, 
Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin 
Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought 
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, 
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay 
Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone 
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here 
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; 
Such was thir awe of Man.   In shadie Bower 
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, 
Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, 
Nor Faunus haunted.   Here in close recess 
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs 
Espoused Eve deckt first her nuptial Bed, 
And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, 
What day the genial Angel to our Sire 
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, 
More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods 
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like 
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son 
Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd 
Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd 
On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. 
 
Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood 
Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd 
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav'n 
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe 
And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night, 
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, 
Which we in our appointed work imployd 
Have finisht happie in our mutual help 
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss 
Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place 
For us too large, where thy abundance wants 
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. 
But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race 
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll 
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, 
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. 
 
This said unanimous, and other Rites 
Observing none, but adoration pure 
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre 
Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off 
These troublesom disguises which wee wear, 
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene 
Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites 
Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: 
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk 
Of puritie and place and innocence, 
Defaming as impure what God declares 
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. 
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain 
But our destroyer, foe to God and Man? 
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source 
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, 
In Paradise of all things common else. 
By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men 
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee 
Founded in Reason, Loyal, just, and Pure, 
Relations dear, and all the Charities 
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. 
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, 
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, 
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, 
Whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, 
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd. 
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights 
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, 
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile 
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, 
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours 
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, 
Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings 
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. 
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, 
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof 
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd.   Sleep on 
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek 
No happier state, and know to know no more. 
 
Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone 
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, 
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim 
Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd 
To thir night watches in warlike Parade, 
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 
 
Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South 
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, 
Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part 
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. 
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld 
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. 
Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed 
Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook, 
But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, 
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. 
This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd 
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen 
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd 
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: 
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 
 
So saying, on he led his radiant Files, 
Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct 
In search of whom they sought: him there they found 
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; 
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach 
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge 
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, 
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint 
Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise 
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise 
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, 
Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires 
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. 
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear 
Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure 
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns 
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts 
Discoverd and surpriz'd.   As when a spark 
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid 
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store 
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine 
With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire: 
So started up in his own shape the Fiend. 
Back stept those two faire Angels half amaz'd 
So sudden to behold the grieslie King; 
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. 
 
Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell 
Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, 
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite 
Here watching at the head of these that sleep? 
 
Know ye not then said Satan, fill'd with scorn, 
Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate 
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; 
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, 
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, 
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin 
Your message, like to end as much in vain? 
To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. 
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, 
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known 
As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure; 
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, 
Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now 
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. 
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account 
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep 
This place inviolable, and these from harm. 
 
So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke 
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace 
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, 
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw 
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd 
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd 
His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd 
Undaunted.   If I must contend, said he, 
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, 
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, 
Or less be lost.   Thy fear, said Zephon bold, 
Will save us trial what the least can doe 
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. 
 
The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; 
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, 
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie 
He held it vain; awe from above had quelld 
His heart, not else dismai'd.   Now drew they nigh 
The western Point, where those half-rounding guard 
just met, and closing stood in squadron joind 
Awaiting next command.   To whom thir Chief 
Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. 
 
O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet 
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne 
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, 
And with them comes a third of Regal port, 
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate 
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, 
Not likely to part hence without contest; 
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. 
 
He scarce had ended, when those two approachd 
And brief related whom they brought, where found, 
How busied, in what form and posture coucht. 
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. 
 
Why hast thou, Satan broke the bounds prescrib'd 
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge 
Of others, who approve not to transgress 
By thy example, but have power and right 
To question thy bold entrance on this place; 
Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those 
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? 
 
To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow. 
Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, 
And such I held thee; but this question askt 
Puts me in doubt.   Lives ther who loves his pain? 
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, 
Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, 
And boldly venture to whatever place 
Farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change 
Torment with ease, and soonest recompence 
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; 
To thee no reason; who knowst only good, 
But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object 
His will who bound us? let him surer barr 
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay 
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. 
The rest is true, they found me where they say; 
But that implies not violence or harme. 
 
Thus he in scorn.The warlike Angel mov'd, 
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. 
O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, 
Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, 
And now returns him from his prison scap't, 
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise 
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither 
Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; 
So wise he judges it to fly from pain 
However, and to scape his punishment. 
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, 
Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight 
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, 
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain 
Can equal anger infinite provok't. 
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee 
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them 
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they 
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, 
The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd 
To thy deserted host this cause of flight, 
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 
 
To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. 
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, 
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood 
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide 
Thy blasting volied Thunder made all speed 
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. 
But still thy words at random, as before, 
Argue thy inexperience what behooves 
From hard assaies and ill successes past 
A faithful Leader, not to hazard all 
Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. 
I therefore, I alone first undertook 
To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie 
This new created World, whereof in Hell 
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find 
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers 
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; 
Though for possession put to try once more 
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; 
Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord 
High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, 
And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. 
 
To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli'd. 
To say and strait unsay, pretending first 
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, 
Argues no Leader but a lyar trac't, 
Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, 
O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! 
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? 
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; 
Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, 
Your military obedience, to dissolve 
Allegeance to th' acknowldg'd Power supream? 
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem 
Patron of liberty, who more then thou 
Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd 
Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope 
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? 
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; 
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre 
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, 
Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, 
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne 
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. 
 
So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats 
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. 
 
Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, 
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then 
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel 
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King 
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, 
Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels 
In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. 
 
While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright 
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes 
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round 
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field 
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends 
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind 
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands 
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves 
Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd 
Collecting all his might dilated stood, 
Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd: 
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest 
Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe 
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds 
Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise 
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope 
Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements 
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne 
With violence of this conflict, had not soon 
Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray 
Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen 
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, 
Wherein all things created first he weighd, 
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire 
In counterpoise, now ponders all events, 
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights 
The sequel each of parting and of fight; 
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; 
Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 
 
Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, 
Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then 
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more 
Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now 
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, 
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign 
Where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, 
If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew 
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled 
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45740/paradise-lost-book-4-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book  6 (1674 version),"ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd 
Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn, 
Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand 
Unbarr'd the gates of Light.   There is a Cave 
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, 
Where light and darkness in perpetual round 
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n 
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; 
Light issues forth, and at the other dore 
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre 
To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well 
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn 
Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold 
Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, 
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain 
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, 
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds 
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: 
Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found 
Already known what he for news had thought 
To have reported: gladly then he mixt 
Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd 
With joy and acclamations loud, that one 
That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one 
Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill 
They led him high applauded, and present 
Before the seat supream; from whence a voice 
From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. 
 
Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought 
The better fight, who single hast maintaind 
Against revolted multitudes the Cause 
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; 
And for the testimonie of Truth hast born 
Universal reproach, far worse to beare 
Then violence: for this was all thy care 
To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds 
Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now 
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, 
Back on thy foes more glorious to return 
Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue 
By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, 
Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King 
Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns. 
Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince, 
And thou in Military prowess next 
Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons 
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints 
By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight; 
Equal in number to that Godless crew 
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms 
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n 
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, 
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf 
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide 
His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. 
 
So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began 
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl 
In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe 
Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud 
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: 
At which command the Powers Militant, 
That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn""d 
Of Union irresistible, mov'd on 
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound 
Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd 
Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds 
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause 
Of God and his Messiah.   On they move 
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, 
Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides 
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground 
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore 
Thir nimble tread, as when the total kind 
Of Birds in orderly array on wing 
Came summond over Eden to receive 
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract 
Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide 
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last 
Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd 
From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht 
In battailous aspect, and neerer view 
Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable 
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields 
Various, with boastful Argument portraid, 
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on 
With furious expedition; for they weend 
That self same day by fight, or by surprize 
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne 
To set the envier of his State, the proud 
Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain 
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd 
At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, 
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet 
So oft in Festivals of joy and love 
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire 
Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout 
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound 
Of onset ended soon each milder thought. 
High in the midst exalted as a God 
Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate 
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd 
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; 
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now 
'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, 
A dreadful intervall, and Front to Front 
Presented stood in terrible array 
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, 
On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn,d, 
Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, 
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; 
Abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood 
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, 
And thus his own undaunted heart explores. 
 
O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest 
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie 
Remain not; wherfore should not strength and might 
There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove 
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? 
His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide, 
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd 
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, 
That he who in debate of Truth hath won, 
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike 
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, 
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so 
Most reason is that Reason overcome. 
 
So pondering, and from his armed Peers 
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met 
His daring foe, at this prevention more 
Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. 
 
Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht 
The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, 
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side 
Abandond at the terror of thy Power 
Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain 
Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms; 
Who out of smallest things could without end 
Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat 
Thy folly; or with solitarie hand 
Reaching beyond all limit at one blow 
Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd 
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest 
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith 
Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then 
To thee not visible, when I alone 
Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent 
From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late 
How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. 
 
Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance 
Thus answerd.   Ill for thee, but in wisht houre 
Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst 
From flight, seditious Angel, to receave 
Thy merited reward, the first assay 
Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue 
Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose 
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met 
Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel 
Vigour Divine within them, can allow 
Omnipotence to none.   But well thou comst 
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win 
From me som Plume, that thy success may show 
Destruction to the rest: this pause between 
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; 
At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n 
To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now 
I see that most through sloth had rather serve, 
Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; 
Such hast thou arm'd, the Ministrelsie of Heav'n, 
Servilitie with freedom to contend, 
As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. 
 
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli'd. 
Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find 
Of erring, from the path of truth remote: 
Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name 
Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, 
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, 
When he who rules is worthiest, and excells 
Them whom he governs.   This is servitude, 
To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld 
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, 
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; 
Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. 
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve 
In Heav'n God ever blest, and his Divine 
Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, 
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while 
From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, 
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. 
So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, 
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell 
On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, 
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield 
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge 
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee 
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth 
Winds under ground or waters forcing way 
Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat 
Half sunk with all his Pines.   Amazement seis'd 
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see 
Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, 
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire 
Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound 
Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven 
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung 
Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze 
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd 
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, 
And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now 
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd 
Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles 
Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise 
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss 
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, 
And flying vaulted either Host with fire. 
So under fierie Cope together rush'd 
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault 
And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n 
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth 
Had to her Center shook.   What wonder? when 
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought 
On either side, the least of whom could weild 
These Elements, and arm him with the force 
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power 
Armie against Armie numberless to raise 
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, 
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; 
Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent 
From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd 
And limited thir might; though numberd such 
As each divided Legion might have seemd 
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand 
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd 
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert 
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway 
Of Battel, open when, and when to close 
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, 
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed 
That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, 
As onely in his arm the moment lay 
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame 
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred 
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground 
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing 
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then 
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale 
The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day 
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes 
No equal, raunging through the dire attack 
Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length 
Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell'd 
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway 
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down 
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand 
He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb 
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield 
A vast circumference:   At his approach 
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile 
Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end 
Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd 
Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown 
And visage all enflam'd first thus began. 
 
Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, 
Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest 
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, 
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self 
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb d 
Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought 
Miserie, uncreated till the crime 
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd 
Thy malice into thousands, once upright 
And faithful, now prov'd false.   But think not here 
To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out 
From all her Confines.   Heav'n the seat of bliss 
Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. 
Hence then, and evil go with thee along 
Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, 
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, 
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, 
Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God 
Precipitate thee with augmented paine. 
 
So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus 
The Adversarie.   Nor think thou with wind 
Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds 
Thou canst not.   Hast thou turnd the least of these 
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise 
Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee 
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats 
To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end 
The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style 
The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, 
Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell 
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, 
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, 
And join him nam'd Almighty to thy aid, 
I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. 
 
They ended parle, and both addrest for fight 
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue 
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things 
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift 
Human imagination to such highth 
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, 
Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms 
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. 
Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire 
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields 
Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood 
In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd 
Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng, 
And left large field, unsafe within the wind 
Of such commotion, such as to set forth 
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, 
Among the Constellations warr were sprung, 
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne 
Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, 
Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. 
Together both with next to Almightie Arme, 
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd 
That might determine, and not need repeate, 
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd 
In might or swift prevention; but the sword 
Of Michael from the Armorie of God 
Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen 
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met 
The sword of Satan with steep force to smite 
Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, 
But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd 
All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, 
And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore 
The griding sword with discontinuous wound 
Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd 
Not long divisible, and from the gash 
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd 
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, 
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. 
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run 
By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd 
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields 
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd 
From off the files of warr; there they him laid 
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame 
To find himself not matchless, and his pride 
Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath 
His confidence to equal God in power. 
Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout 
Vital in every part, not as frail man 
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines; 
Cannot but by annihilating die; 
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound 
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: 
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, 
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, 
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size 
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. 
 
Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd 
Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, 
And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array 
Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd, 
And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound 
Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n 
Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon 
Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes 
And uncouth paine fled bellowing.   On each wing 
Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, 
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, 
Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai, 
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods 
Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, 
Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile, 
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy 
The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow 
Ariel and Arioc, and the violence 
Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. 
I might relate of thousands, and thir names 
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect 
Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n 
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort 
In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, 
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome 
Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie, 
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. 
For strength from Truth divided and from Just, 
Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise 
And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires 
Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: 
Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. 
 
And now thir Mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, 
With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout 
Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground 
With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap 
Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd 
And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld 
Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host 
Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, 
Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine 
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought 
By sin of disobedience, till that hour 
Not liable to fear or flight or paine. 
Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints 
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire, 
Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: 
Such high advantages thir innocence 
Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, 
Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood 
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd 
By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. 
 
Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n 
Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, 
And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: 
Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, 
Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field 
Michael and his Angels prevalent 
Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, 
Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part 
Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, 
Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, 
His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; 
And in the midst thus undismai'd began. 
 
O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes 
Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, 
Found worthy not of Libertie alone, 
Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, 
Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, 
Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight 
(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) 
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send 
Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd 
Sufficient to subdue us to his will, 
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, 
Of future we may deem him, though till now 
Omniscient thought.   True is, less firmly arm'd, 
Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, 
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, 
Since now we find this our Empyreal form 
Incapable of mortal injurie 
Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, 
Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. 
Of evil then so small as easie think 
The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, 
Weapons more violent, when next we meet, 
May serve to better us, and worse our foes, 
Or equal what between us made the odds, 
In Nature none: if other hidden cause 
Left them Superiour, while we can preserve 
Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, 
Due search and consultation will disclose. 
 
He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood 
Nisroc of Principalities the prime; 
As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, 
Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, 
And cIoudie in aspect thus answering spake. 
Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free 
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard 
For Gods, and too unequal work we find 
Against unequal armes to fight in paine, 
Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil 
Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes 
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain 
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands 
Of Mightiest.   Sense of pleasure we may well 
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, 
But live content, which is the calmest life: 
But pain is perfet miserie, the worst 
Of evils, and excessive, overturnes 
All patience.   He who therefore can invent 
With what more forcible we may offend 
Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme 
Our selves with like defence, to me deserves 
No less then for deliverance what we owe. 
 
Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd. 
Not uninvented that, which thou aright 
Believst so main to our success, I bring; 
Which of us who beholds the bright surface 
Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, 
This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd 
With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, 
Whose Eye so superficially surveyes 
These things, as not to mind from whence they grow 
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, 
Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht 
With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth 
So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. 
These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep 
Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame, 
Which into hallow Engins long and round 
Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire 
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth 
From far with thundring noise among our foes 
Such implements of mischief as shall dash 
To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands 
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd 
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. 
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, 
Effect shall end our wish.   Mean while revive; 
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind 
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. 
He ended, and his words thir drooping chere 
Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. 
Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee 
To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd 
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought 
Impossible: yet haply of thy Race 
In future dayes, if Malice should aboun, 
Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd 
With dev'lish machination might devise 
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men 
For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. 
Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, 
None arguing stood, innumerable hands 
Were ready, in a moment up they turnd 
Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath 
Th' originals of Nature in thir crude 
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame 
They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, 
Concocted and adusted they reduc'd 
To blackest grain, and into store convey'd: 
Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth 
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, 
Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls 
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed 
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. 
So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night 
Secret they finish'd, and in order set, 
With silent circumspection unespi'd. 
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd 
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms 
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood 
Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, 
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills 
Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, 
Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, 
Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, 
In motion or in alt: him soon they met 
Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow 
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail 
Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, 
Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. 
 
Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, 
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit 
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud 
He comes, and settl'd in his face I see 
Sad resolution and secure: let each 
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each 
Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, 
Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, 
If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, 
But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. 
So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon 
In order, quit of all impediment; 
Instant without disturb they took Allarm, 
And onward move Embattelld; when behold 
Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe 
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube 
Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd 
On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, 
To hide the fraud.   At interview both stood 
A while, but suddenly at head appeerd 
Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. 
 
Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; 
That all may see who hate us, how we seek 
Peace and composure, and with open brest 
Stand readie to receive them, if they like 
Our overture, and turn not back perverse; 
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, 
Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge 
Freely our part; yee who appointed stand 
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch 
What we propound, and loud that all may hear. 
 
So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce 
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front 
Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. 
Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, 
A triple mounted row of Pillars laid 
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd 
Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr 
With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) 
Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes 
With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, 
Portending hollow truce; at each behind 
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed 
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, 
Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, 
Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds 
Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd 
With nicest touch.   Immediate in a flame, 
But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, 
From those deep throated Engins belcht, whose roar 
Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, 
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule 
Thir devilish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail 
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host 
Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, 
That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, 
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell 
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; 
The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might 
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift 
By quick contraction or remove; but now 
Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; 
Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. 
What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse 
Repeated, and indecent overthrow 
Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, 
And to thir foes a laughter; for in view 
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row 
In posture to displode thir second tire 
Of Thunder: back defeated to return 
They worse abhorr'd.   Satan beheld thir plight, 
And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. 
 
O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? 
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, 
To entertain them fair with open Front 
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms 
Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, 
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, 
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd 
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps 
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose 
If our proposals once again were heard 
We should compel them to a quick result. 
 
To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood, 
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, 
Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, 
Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, 
And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, 
Had need from head to foot well understand; 
Not understood, this gift they have besides, 
They shew us when our foes walk not upright. 
 
So they among themselves in pleasant veine 
Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond 
All doubt of Victorie, eternal might 
To match with thir inventions they presum'd 
So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, 
And all his Host derided, while they stood 
A while in trouble; but they stood not long, 
Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms 
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. 
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power 
Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) 
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills 
(For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n 
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) 
Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, 
From thir foundations loosning to and fro 
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, 
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops 
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, 
Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, 
When coming towards them so dread they saw 
The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, 
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row 
They saw them whelm'd, and all thir confidence 
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, 
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads 
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air 
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, 
Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and bruis'd 
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain 
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, 
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind 
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, 
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. 
The rest in imitation to like Armes 
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; 
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills 
Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire 
That under ground, they fought in dismal shade; 
Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game 
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt 
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n 
Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspred, 
Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits 
Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, 
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen 
This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: 
That his great purpose he might so fulfill, 
To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd 
Upon his enemies, and to declare 
All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son 
Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. 
Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, 
Son in whose face invisible is beheld 
Visibly, what by Deitie I am, 
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, 
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, 
Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, 
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame 
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, 
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; 
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, 
Equal in their Creation they were form'd, 
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought 
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; 
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last 
Endless, and no solution will be found: 
Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, 
And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, 
With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes 
Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. 
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; 
For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr 
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine 
Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou 
Can end it.   Into thee such Vertue and Grace 
Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know 
In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, 
And this perverse Commotion governd thus, 
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir 
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King 
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. 
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, 
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles 
That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, 
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms 
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; 
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out 
From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: 
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise 
God and Messiah his anointed King. 
 
He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct 
Shon full, he all his Father full expresst 
Ineffably into his face receiv'd, 
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. 
 
O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, 
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst 
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, 
As is most just; this I my Glorie account, 
My exaltation, and my whole delight, 
That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will 
Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. 
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, 
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end 
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee 
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: 
But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on 
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, 
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, 
Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, 
To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down 
To chains of darkness, and th' undying Worm, 
That from thy just obedience could revolt, 
Whom to obey is happiness entire. 
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure 
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount 
Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, 
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. 
So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose 
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, 
And the third sacred Morn began to shine 
Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound 
The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, 
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, 
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd 
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each 
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all 
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels 
Of Beril, and careering Fires between; 
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, 
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure 
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. 
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd 
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, 
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie 
Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow 
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, 
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld 
Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; 
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, 
He onward came, farr off his coming shon, 
And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) 
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: 
Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime 
On the Chrystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. 
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own 
First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, 
When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd 
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: 
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduc'd 
His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, 
Under thir Head imbodied all in one. 
Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; 
At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd 
Each to his place, they heard his voice and went 
Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, 
And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. 
This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur'd, 
And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers 
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. 
In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? 
But to convince the proud what Signs availe, 
Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? 
They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, 
Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight 
Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, 
Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud 
Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile 
Against God and Messiah, or to fall 
In universal ruin last, and now 
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, 
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God 
To all his Host on either hand thus spake. 
 
Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand 
Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; 
Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God 
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, 
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don 
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew 
The punishment to other hand belongs, 
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; 
Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd 
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold 
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd 
By mee, not you but mee they have despis'd, 
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, 
Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream 
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, 
Hath honourd me according to his will. 
Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; 
That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee 
In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, 
Or I alone against them, since by strength 
They measure all, of other excellence 
Not emulous, nor care who them excells; 
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. 
 
So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd 
His count'nance too severe to be beheld 
And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. 
At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings 
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes 
Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound 
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. 
Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, 
Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles 
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, 
All but the Throne it self of God.   Full soon 
Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand 
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent 
Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd 
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, 
All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; 
O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode 
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, 
That wisht the Mountains now might be again 
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. 
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell 
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, 
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels 
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, 
One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye 
Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire 
Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, 
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, 
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. 
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd 
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant 
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: 
The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard 
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd 
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd 
With terrors and with furies to the bounds 
And Chrystal wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, 
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd 
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight 
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse 
Urg'd them behind; headlong themselves they threw 
Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth 
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. 
 
Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw 
Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled 
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep 
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. 
Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, 
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall 
Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout 
Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last 
Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, 
Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire 
Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. 
Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird 
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. 
Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes 
Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: 
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood 
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, 
With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, 
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, 
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, 
Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, 
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode 
Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts 
And Temple of his migihtie Father Thron'd 
On high: who into Glorie him receav'd, 
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. 
 
Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth 
At thy request, and that thou maist beware 
By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd 
What might have else to human Race bin hid; 
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n 
Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall 
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld 
With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, 
Who now is plotting how he may seduce 
Thee also from obedience, that with him 
Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake 
His punishment, Eternal miserie; 
Which would be all his solace and revenge, 
As a despite don against the most High, 
Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. 
But list'n not to his Temptations, warne 
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard 
By terrible Example the reward 
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, 
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45742/paradise-lost-book-6-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book  7 (1674 version),"DEscend from Heav'n Urania, by that name 
If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine 
Following, above th' Olympian Hill I soare, 
Above the flight of Pegasean wing. 
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou 
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top 
Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne, 
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd, 
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, 
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play 
In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd 
With thy Celestial Song.   Up led by thee 
Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd, 
An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, 
Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down 
Return me to my Native Element: 
Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once 
Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) 
Dismounted, on th' Aleian Field I fall 
Erroneous there to wander and forlorne. 
Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound 
Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; 
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, 
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd 
To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes, 
On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues; 
In darkness, and with dangers compast round, 
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou 
Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn 
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, 
Urania, and fit audience find, though few. 
But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance 
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race 
Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard 
In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares 
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround 
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend 
Her Son.   So fail not thou, who thee implores: 
For thou are Heav'nlie, shee an emptie dreame. 
 
Say Goddess, what ensu'd when Raphael, 
The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn'd 
Adam by dire example to beware 
Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven 
To those Apostates, least the like befall 
In Paradise to Adam or his Race, 
Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree, 
If they transgress, and slight that sole command, 
So easily obeyd amid the choice 
Of all tastes else to please thir appetite, 
Though wandring.   He with his consorted Eve 
The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd 
With admiration, and deep Muse to hear 
Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought 
So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n, 
And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss 
With such confusion: but the evil soon 
Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those 
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix 
With Blessedness.   Whence Adam soon repeal'd 
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now 
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know 
What neerer might concern him, how this World 
Of Heav'n and Earth conspicious first began, 
When, and whereof created, for what cause, 
What within Eden or without was done 
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth 
Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame, 
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, 
Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest. 
 
Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, 
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd 
Divine interpreter, by favour sent 
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne 
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, 
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: 
For which to the infinitly Good we owe 
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment 
Receave with solemne purpose to observe 
Immutably his sovran will, the end 
Of what we are.   But since thou hast voutsaf't 
Gently for our instruction to impart 
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd 
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, 
Deign to descend now lower, and relate 
What may no less perhaps availe us known, 
How first began this Heav'n which we behold 
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd 
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills 
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd 
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause 
Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest 
Through all Eternitie so late to build 
In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon 
Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould 
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske 
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more 
To magnifie his works, the more we know. 
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run 
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n 
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, 
And longer will delay to heare thee tell 
His Generation, and the rising Birth 
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: 
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon 
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring 
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, 
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song 
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. 
 
Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought: 
 
And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. 
This also thy request with caution askt 
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works 
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, 
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? 
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve 
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr 
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld 
Thy hearing, such Commission from above 
I have receav'd, to answer thy desire 
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain 
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope 
Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, 
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, 
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: 
Anough is left besides to search and know. 
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less 
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know 
In measure what the mind may well contain, 
Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns 
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. 
 
Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n 
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host 
Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) 
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep 
Into his place, and the great Son returnd 
Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent 
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld 
Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. 
 
At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought 
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid 
This inaccessible high strength, the seat 
Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, 
He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud 
Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; 
Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, 
Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines 
Number sufficient to possess her Realmes 
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent 
With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: 
But least his heart exalt him in the harme 
Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n 
My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire 
That detriment, if such it be to lose 
Self-lost, and in a moment will create 
Another World, out of one man a Race 
Of men innumerable, there to dwell, 
Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd 
They open to themselves at length the way 
Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, 
And Earth be chang'd to Heav'n, & Heav'n to Earth, 
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. 
Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, 
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee 
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: 
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee 
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep 
Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, 
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill 
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. 
Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, 
And put not forth my goodness, which is free 
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance 
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. 
 
So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake 
His Word, the filial Godhead, gave effect. 
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift 
Then time or motion, but to human ears 
Cannot without process of speech be told, 
So told as earthly notion can receave. 
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n 
When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; 
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will 
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: 
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire 
Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight 
And th' habitations of the just; to him 
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd 
Good out of evil to create, in stead 
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring 
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse 
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. 
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son 
On his great Expedition now appeer'd, 
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd 
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love 
Immense, and all his Father in him shon. 
About his Chariot numberless were pour'd 
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, 
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, 
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old 
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd 
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, 
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth 
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, 
Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide 
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound 
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth 
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word 
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. 
On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore 
They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss 
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, 
Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes 
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault 
Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. 
 
Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, 
Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: 
Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim 
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode 
Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; 
For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine 
Follow'd in bright procession to behold 
Creation, and the wonders of his might. 
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand 
He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd 
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe 
This Universe, and all created things: 
One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd 
Round through the vast profunditie obscure, 
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, 
This be thy just Circumference, O World. 
Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, 
Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound 
Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme 
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, 
And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth 
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd 
The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs 
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd 
Like things to like, the rest to several place 
Disparted, and between spun out the Air, 
And Earth self ballanc't on her Center hung. 
 
Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light 
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure 
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East 
To journie through the airie gloom began, 
Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun 
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle 
Sojourn'd the while.   God saw the Light was good; 
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere 
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night 
He nam'd.   Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: 
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung 
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light 
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; 
Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout 
The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, 
And touch't thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais'd 
God and his works, Creatour him they sung, 
Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. 
 
Again, God said, let ther be Firmament 
Amid the Waters, and let it divide 
The Waters from the Waters: and God made 
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, 
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd 
In circuit to the uttermost convex 
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, 
The Waters underneath from those above 
Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World 
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide 
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule 
Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames 
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: 
And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n 
And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. 
 
The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet 
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, 
Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth 
Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme 
Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, 
Fermented the great Mother to conceave, 
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said 
Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n 
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. 
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer 
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave 
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: 
So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low 
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, 
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they 
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld 
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; 
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, 
For haste; such flight the great command impress'd 
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call 
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) 
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, 
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, 
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, 
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, 
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide 
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, 
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; 
Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, 
All but within those banks, where Rivers now 
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. 
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle 
Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: 
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth 
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed, 
And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind; 
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. 
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then 
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, 
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad 
Her Universal Face with pleasant green, 
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd 
Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay 
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, 
Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept 
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed 
Embattell'd in her field: and the humble Shrub, 
And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last 
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred 
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd 
Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd, 
With tufts the vallies and each fountain side, 
With borders long the Rivers.   That Earth now 
Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, 
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt 
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd 
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground 
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist 
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each 
Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth 
God made, and every Herb, before it grew 
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good. 
So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. 
 
Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights 
High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide 
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, 
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, 
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine 
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n 
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. 
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use 
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, 
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, 
And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n 
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day 
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, 
And Light from Darkness to divide.   God saw, 
Surveying his great Work, that it was good: 
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun 
A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, 
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon 
Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs, 
And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: 
Of Light by farr the greater part he took, 
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd 
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive 
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine 
Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. 
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs 
Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, 
And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns; 
By tincture or reflection they augment 
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight 
So farr remote, with diminution seen. 
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, 
Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round 
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run 
His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray 
Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd 
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, 
But opposite in leveld West was set 
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light 
From him, for other light she needed none 
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes 
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, 
Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign 
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, 
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd 
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd 
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, 
Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day. 
 
And God said, let the Waters generate 
Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: 
And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings 
Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. 
And God created the great Whales, and each 
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously 
The waters generated by thir kindes, 
And every Bird of wing after his kinde; 
And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, 
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas 
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; 
And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. 
Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay 
With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales 
Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales 
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft 
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate 
Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves 
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance 
Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, 
Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend 
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food 
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, 
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk 
Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate 
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan 
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep 
Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, 
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles 
Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. 
Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares 
Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon 
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd 
Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge 
They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime 
With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud 
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork 
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: 
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise 
In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, 
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth 
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's 
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing 
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane 
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire 
Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: 
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song 
So1ac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings 
Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal 
Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: 
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd 
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck 
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes 
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit 
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre 
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground 
Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds 
The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine 
Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue 
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.   The Waters thus 
With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, 
Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. 
 
The Sixt, and of Creation last arose 
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, 
Let th' Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde, 
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, 
Each in their kinde.   The Earth obey'd, and strait 
Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth 
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, 
Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up rose 
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns 
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; 
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: 
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: 
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks 
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung. 
The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd 
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free 
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, 
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, 
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale 
Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw 
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground 
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould 
Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd 
His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, 
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land 
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. 
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, 
Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans 
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact 
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride 
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: 
These as a line thir long dimension drew, 
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all 
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde 
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd 
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.   First crept 
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident 
Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, 
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps 
Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes 
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd 
The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone 
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells 
With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, 
And thou thir Natures know'st, & gav'st them Names, 
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown 
The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, 
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes 
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee 
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. 
Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld 
Her motions, as the great first Movers hand 
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire 
Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, 
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt 
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; 
There wanted yet the Master work, the end 
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone 
And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd 
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect 
His Stature, and upright with Front serene 
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence 
Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, 
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good 
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes 
Directed in Devotion, to adore 
And worship God Supream, who made him chief 
Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent 
Eternal Father (For where is not hee 
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. 
 
Let us make now Man in our image, Man 
In our similitude, and let them rule 
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, 
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, 
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. 
This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man 
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd 
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee 
Created thee, in the Image of God 
Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. 
Male he created thee, but thy consort 
Female for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, 
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, 
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold 
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, 
And every living thing that moves on the Earth. 
Wherever thus created, for no place 
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knows't 
He brought thee into this delicious Grove, 
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, 
Delectable both to behold and taste; 
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food 
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yields, 
Varietie without end; but of the Tree 
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, 
Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; 
Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, 
And govern well thy appetite, least sin 
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. 
Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made 
View'd, and behold all was entirely good; 
So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: 
Yet not till the Creator from his work 
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd 
Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, 
Thence to behold this new created World 
Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd 
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, 
Answering his great Idea.   Up he rode 
Followd with acclamation and the sound 
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd 
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire 
Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) 
The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, 
The Planets in thir station list'ning stood, 
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. 
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, 
Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in 
The great Creator from his work returnd 
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; 
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne 
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men 
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse 
Thither will send his winged Messengers 
On errands of supernal Grace.   So sung 
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, 
That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led 
To Gods Eternal house direct the way, 
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold 
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, 
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way 
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest 
Pouderd with Starrs.   And now on Earth the Seventh 
Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun 
Was set, and twilight from the East came on, 
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount 
Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne 
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, 
The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down 
With his great Father (for he also went 
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge 
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, 
Author and end of all things, and from work 
Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, 
As resting on that day from all his work, 
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp 
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, 
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, 
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire 
Temper'd sort Tunings, intermixt with Voice 
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds 
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. 
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, 
Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite 
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue 
Relate thee; greater now in thy return 
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day 
Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create 
Is greater then created to destroy. 
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound 
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt 
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine 
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought 
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw 
The number of thy worshippers.   Who seekes 
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves 
To manifest the more thy might: his evil 
Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. 
Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n 
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view 
On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; 
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's 
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World 
Of destind habitation; but thou know'st 
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, 
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd, 
Thir pleasant dwelling place.   Thrice happie men, 
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't, 
Created in his Image, there to dwell 
And worship him, and in reward to rule 
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, 
And multiply a Race of Worshippers 
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know 
Thir happiness, and persevere upright. 
So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, 
With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. 
And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd 
How first this World and face of things began, 
And what before thy memorie was don 
From the beginning, that posteritie 
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst

John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book  8 (1674 version),"THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare 
So Charming left his voice, that he a while 
Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear; 
Then as new wak't thus gratefully repli'd. 
What thanks sufficient, or what recompence 
Equal have I to render thee, Divine 
Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd 
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't 
This friendly condescention to relate 
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard 
With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, 
With glorie attributed to the high 
Creator; something yet of doubt remaines, 
Which onely thy solution can resolve. 
When I behold this goodly Frame, this World 
Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute, 
Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, 
An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd 
And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle 
Spaces incomprehensible (for such 
Thir distance argues and thir swift return 
Diurnal) meerly to officiate light 
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, 
One day and night; in all thir vast survey 
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, 
How Nature wise and frugal could commit 
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand 
So many nobler Bodies to create, 
Greater so manifold to this one use, 
For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose 
Such restless revolution day by day 
Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, 
That better might with farr less compass move, 
Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines 
Her end without least motion, and receaves, 
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought 
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; 
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. 
 
So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd 
Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve 
Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight, 
With lowliness Majestic from her seat, 
And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, 
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, 
To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom, 
Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung 
And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. 
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse 
Delighted, or not capable her eare 
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd, 
Adam relating, she sole Auditress; 
Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd 
Before the Angel, and of him to ask 
Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix 
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute 
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip 
Not Words alone pleas'd her.   O when meet now 
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd? 
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; 
Not unattended, for on her as Queen 
A pomp of winning Graces waited still, 
And from about her shot Darts of desire 
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. 
And Raphael now to Adam's doubt propos'd 
Benevolent and facil thus repli'd. 
 
To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n 
Is as the Book of God before thee set, 
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne 
His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares: 
This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth, 
Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest 
From Man or Angel the great Architect 
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge 
His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought 
Rather admire; or if they list to try 
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns 
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move 
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide 
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n 
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild 
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive 
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear 
With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're, 
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: 
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, 
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest 
That bodies bright and greater should not serve 
The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run, 
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves 
The benefit: consider first, that Great 
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth 
Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small, 
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe 
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines 
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, 
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd 
His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find. 
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries 
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. 
And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak 
The Makers high magnificence, who built 
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; 
That Man may know he dwells not in his own; 
An Edifice too large for him to fill, 
Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest 
Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. 
The swiftness of those Circles attribute 
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, 
That to corporeal substances could adde 
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, 
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n 
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd 
In Eden, distance inexpressible 
By Numbers that have name.   But this I urge, 
Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew 
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd; 
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem 
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. 
God to remove his wayes from human sense, 
Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, 
If it presume, might erre in things too high, 
And no advantage gaine.   What if the Sun 
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs 
By his attractive vertue and thir own 
Incited, dance about him various rounds? 
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, 
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, 
In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these 
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, 
Insensibly three different Motions move? 
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, 
Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, 
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift 
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd, 
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele 
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, 
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day 
Travelling East, and with her part averse 
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part 
Still luminous by his ray.   What if that light 
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, 
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr 
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night 
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, 
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest 
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce 
Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate 
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps 
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie 
Communicating Male and Femal Light, 
Which two great Sexes animate the World, 
Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. 
For such vast room in Nature unpossest 
By living Soule, desert and desolate, 
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute 
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr 
Down to this habitable, which returnes 
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. 
But whether thus these things, or whether not, 
Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n 
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun 
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, 
Or Shee from West her silent course advance 
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps 
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, 
And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along, 
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, 
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; 
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, 
Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou 
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise 
And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high 
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:. 
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; 
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there 
Live, in what state, condition or degree, 
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd 
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n. 
 
To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. 
How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure 
Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, 
And freed from intricacies, taught to live, 
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts 
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which 
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, 
And not molest us, unless we our selves 
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain. 
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave 
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; 
Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, 
That not to know at large of things remote 
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know 
That which before us lies in daily life, 
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, 
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, 
And renders us in things that most concerne 
Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. 
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend 
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand 
Useful, whence haply mention may arise 
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask 
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. 
Thee I have heard relating what was don 
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate 
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; 
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest 
How suttly to detaine thee I devise, 
Inviting thee to hear while I relate, 
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: 
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, 
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare 
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst 
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre 
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, 
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine 
Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. 
To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. 
 
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, 
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee 
Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd 
Inward and outward both, his image faire: 
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace 
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes, 
Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth 
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire 
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: 
For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set 
On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on; 
For I that Day was absent, as befell, 
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, 
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; 
Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) 
To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, 
Or enemie, while God was in his work, 
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, 
Destruction with Creation might have mixt. 
Not that they durst without his leave attempt, 
But us he sends upon his high behests 
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure 
Our prompt obedience.   Fast we found, fast shut 
The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; 
But long ere our approaching heard within 
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, 
Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. 
Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light 
Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. 
But thy relation now; for I attend, 
Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. 
 
So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. 
For Man to tell how human Life began 
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? 
Desire with thee still longer to converse 
Induc'd me.   As new wak't from soundest sleep 
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid 
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun 
Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. 
Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, 
And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd 
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, 
As thitherward endevoring, and upright 
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw 
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, 
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, 
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, 
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, 
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. 
My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb 
Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran 
With supple joints, and lively vigour led: 
But who I was, or where, or from what cause, 
Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake 
My Tongue obey'd and readily could name 
What e're I saw.   Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, 
And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, 
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, 
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, 
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? 
Not of my self; by some great Maker then, 
In goodness and in power praeeminent; 
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, 
From whom I have that thus I move and live, 
And feel that I am happier then I know. 
While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, 
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld 
This happie Light, when answer none return'd, 
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours 
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep 
First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd 
My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought 
I then was passing to my former state 
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: 
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, 
Whose inward apparition gently mov'd 
My fancy to believe I yet had being, 
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, 
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, 
First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd 
First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide 
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. 
So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, 
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire 
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up 
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, 
A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees 
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw 
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd.   Each Tree 
Load'n with fairest Fruit that hung to the Eye 
Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite 
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found 
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream 
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun 
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide 
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd 
Presence Divine.   Rejoycing, but with aw 
In adoration at his feet I fell 
Submiss: he rear'd me, and Whom thou soughtst I am, 
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest 
Above, or round about thee or beneath. 
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine 
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: 
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes 
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: 
But of the Tree whose operation brings 
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set 
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith 
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life 
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, 
And shun the bitter consequence: for know, 
The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command 
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; 
From that day mortal, and this happie State 
Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World 
Of woe and sorrow.   Sternly he pronounc'd 
The rigid interdiction, which resounds 
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice 
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect 
Return'd and gracious purpose thus renew'd. 
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth 
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords 
Possess it, and all things that therein live, 
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. 
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold 
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave 
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie 
With low subjection; understand the same 
Of Fish within thir watry residence, 
Not hither summond, since they cannot change 
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. 
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold 
Approaching two and two, These cowring low 
With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. 
I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood 
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd 
My sudden apprehension: but in these 
I found not what me thought I wanted still; 
And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. 
 
O by what Name, for thou above all these, 
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, 
Surpassest farr my naming, how may I 
Adore thee, Author of this Universe, 
And all this good to man, for whose well being 
So amply, and with hands so liberal 
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee 
I see not who partakes.   In solitude 
What happiness, who can enjoy alone, 
Or all enjoying, what contentment find? 
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, 
As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. 
What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth 
With various living creatures, and the Aire 
Replenisht, and all these at thy command 
To come and play before thee, know'st thou not 
Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, 
And reason not contemptibly; with these 
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. 
So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd 
So ordering.   I with leave of speech implor'd, 
And humble deprecation thus repli'd. 
 
Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, 
My Maker, be propitious while I speak. 
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, 
And these inferiour farr beneath me set? 
Among unequals what societie 
Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? 
Which must be mutual, in proportion due 
Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie 
The one intense, the other still remiss 
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove 
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak 
Such as I seek, fit to participate 
All rational delight, wherein the brute 
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce 
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; 
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; 
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle 
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; 
Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. 
Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. 
 A nice and suttle happiness I see 
Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice 
Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste 
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. 
What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, 
Seem I to thee sufficiently possest 
Of happiness, or not? who am alone 
From all Eternitie, for none I know 
Second to me or like, equal much less. 
How have I then with whom to hold converse 
Save with the Creatures which I made, and those 
To me inferiour, infinite descents 
Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? 
He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd.   To attaine 
The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes 
All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; 
Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee 
Is no deficience found; not so is Man, 
But in degree, the cause of his desire 
By conversation with his like to help, 
Or solace his defects.   No need that thou 
Shouldst propagat, already infinite; 
And through all numbers absolute, though One; 
But Man by number is to manifest 
His single imperfection, and beget 
Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, 
In unitie defective, which requires 
Collateral love, and deerest amitie. 
Thou in thy secresie although alone, 
Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not 
Social communication, yet so pleas'd, 
Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt 
Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; 
I by conversing cannot these erect 
From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. 
Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd 
Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd 
This answer from the gratious voice Divine. 
 
Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, 
And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, 
Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, 
Expressing well the spirit within thee free, 
My Image, not imparted to the Brute, 
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee 
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, 
And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, 
Knew it not good for Man to be alone, 
And no such companie as then thou saw'st 
Intended thee, for trial onely brought, 
To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: 
What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, 
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, 
Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire. 
 
Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now 
My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, 
Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth 
In that celestial Colloquie sublime, 
As with an object that excels the sense, 
Dazl d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair 
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd 
By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. 
Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell 
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which 
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, 
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape 
Still glorious before whom awake I stood; 
Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took 
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, 
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, 
But suddenly with flesh fill'd up and heal'd: 
The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; 
Under his forming hands a Creature grew, 
Manlike, but different Sex, so lovly faire, 
That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now 
Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd 
And in her looks, which from that time infus'd 
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, 
And into all things from her Aire inspir'd 
The spirit of love and amorous delight. 
Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd 
To find her, or for ever to deplore 
Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: 
When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, 
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd 
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow 
To make her amiable: On she came, 
Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, 
And guided by his voice, nor uninformd 
Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: 
Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, 
In every gesture dignitie and love. 
I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. 
 
This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd 
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, 
Giver of all things faire, but fairest this 
Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.   I now see 
Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self 
Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man 
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe 
Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; 
And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. 
 
She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, 
Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, 
Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, 
That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, 
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, 
The more desirable, or to say all, 
Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, 
Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; 
I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, 
And with obsequious Majestie approv'd 
My pleaded reason.   To the Nuptial Bowre 
I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, 
And happie Constellations on that houre 
Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth 
Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; 
Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires 
Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings 
Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, 
Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night 
Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr 
On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. 
Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought 
My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss 
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find 
In all things else delight indeed, but such 
As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, 
Nor vehement desire, these delicacies 
I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, and Flours, 
Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here 
Farr otherwise, transported I behold, 
Transported touch; here passion first I felt, 
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else 
Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake 
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. 
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part 
Not proof enough such Object to sustain, 
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps 
More then enough; at least on her bestow'd 
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew 
Elaborate, of inward less exact. 
For well I understand in the prime end 
Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind 
And inward Faculties, which most excell, 
In outward also her resembling less 
His Image who made both, and less expressing 
The character of that Dominion giv'n 
O're other Creatures; yet when I approach 
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems 
And in her self compleat, so well to know 
Her own, that what she wills to do or say, 
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; 
All higher knowledge in her presence falls 
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her 
Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; 
Authority and Reason on her waite, 
As one intended first, not after made 
Occasionally; and to consummate all, 
Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat 
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe 
About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. 
To whom the Angel with contracted brow. 
 
Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; 
Do thou but thine, and be not diffident 
Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou 
Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, 
By attributing overmuch to things 
Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. 
For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, 
An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well 
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, 
Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; 
Then value: Oft times nothing profits more 
Then self esteem, grounded on just and right 
Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, 
The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, 
And to realities yield all her shows: 
Made so adorn for thy delight the more, 
So awful, that with honour thou maist love 
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. 
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind 
Is propagated seem such dear delight 
Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't 
To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be 
To them made common and divulg'd, if aught 
Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue 
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. 
What higher in her societie thou findst 
Attractive, human, rational, love still; 
In loving thou dost well, in passion not, 
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines 
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat 
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale 
By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, 
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause 
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. 
 
To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. 
Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught 
In procreation common to all kindes 
(Though higher of the genial Bed by far, 
And with mysterious reverence I deem) 
So much delights me as those graceful acts, 
Those thousand decencies that daily flow 
From all her words and actions mixt with Love 
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd 
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; 
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair 
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. 
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose 
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, 
Who meet with various objects, from the sense 
Variously representing; yet still free 
Approve the best, and follow what I approve. 
To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist 
Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; 
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; 
Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love 
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix 
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? 
 
To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd 
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, 
Answer'd.   Let it suffice thee that thou know'st 
Us happie, and without Love no happiness. 
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st 
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy 
In eminence, and obstacle find none 
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: 
Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits embrace, 
Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure 
Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need 
As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. 
But I can now no more; the parting Sun 
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles 
Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. 
Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all 
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep 
His great command; take heed least Passion sway 
Thy judgement to do aught, which else free Will 
Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons 
The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. 
I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, 
And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall 
Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. 
Perfet within, no outward aid require; 
And all temptation to transgress repel. 
 
So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus 
Follow'd with benediction.   Since to part, 
Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, 
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. 
Gentle to me and affable hath been 
Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever 
With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind 
Be good and friendly still, and oft return. 
 
So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n 
From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45744/paradise-lost-book-8-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes
Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,
And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires
Easie my unpremeditated Verse:
Since first this Subject for Heroic Song
Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;
Not sedulous by Nature to indite
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument
Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect
With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights
In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields,
Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights
At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast
Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
Not that which justly gives Heroic name
To Person or to Poem.   Mee of these
Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument
Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise
That name, unless an age too late, or cold
Climat, or Years damp my intended wing
Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.

The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr
Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:
When Satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd
In meditated fraud and malice, bent
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd.
By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri'd
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n,
The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
Found unsuspected way.   There was a place,
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
In with the River sunk, and with it rose
Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land
From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole
Maotis, up beyond the River Ob;
Downward as farr Antartic; and in length
West from Orontes to the Ocean barr'd
At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes
Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam'd
With narrow search; and with inspection deep
Consider'd every Creature, which of all
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.
Him after long debate, irresolute
Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,
As from his wit and native suttletie
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd
Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r
Active within beyond the sense of brute.
Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:

O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferr'd
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,
In thee concentring all thir precious beams
Of sacred influence:   As God in Heav'n
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou
Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth
Of Creatures animate with gradual life
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.
With what delight could I have walkt thee round,
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,
Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd,
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these
Find place or refuge; and the more I see
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
Of contraries; all good to me becomes
Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n
To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;
Nor hope to be my self less miserable
By what I seek, but others to make such
As I, though thereby worse to me redound:
For onely in destroying I find ease
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,
Or won to what may work his utter loss,
For whom all this was made, all this will soon
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,
In wo then; that destruction wide may range:
To mee shall be the glorie sole among
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd
What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days
Continu'd making, and who knows how long
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps
Not longer then since I in one Night freed
From servitude inglorious welnigh half
Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng
Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,
And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild
More Angels to Create, if they at least
Are his Created, or to spite us more,
Determin'd to advance into our room
A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,
Exalted from so base original,
With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed
He effected; Man he made, and for him built
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,
Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!
Subjected to his service Angel wings,
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend
Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
O foul descent! that I who erst contended
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind
Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,
This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;
But what will not Ambition and Revenge
Descend to? who aspires must down as low
As high he soard, obnoxious first or last
To basest things.   Revenge, at first though sweet,
Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,
Since higher I fall short, on him who next
Provokes my envie, this new Favorite
Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,
Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.

So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
His midnight search, where soonest he might finde
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,
His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,
In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd
With act intelligential, but his sleep
Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.
Now when as sacred Light began to dawne
In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd
Thir morning incense, when all things that breath,
From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair
And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.
And Eve first to her Husband thus began.

Adam, well may we labour still to dress
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour,
Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wilde.   Thou therefore now advise
Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present,
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct
The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:
For while so near each other thus all day
Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits
Our dayes work brought to little, though begun
Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.

To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd.
Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond
Compare above all living Creatures deare,
Well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd
How we might best fulfill the work which here
God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass
Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found
In Woman, then to studie houshold good,
And good workes in her Husband to promote.
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd
Labour, as to debarr us when we need
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,
To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,
Love not the lowest end of human life.
For not to irksom toile, but to delight
He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.
These paths & Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield.
For solitude somtimes is best societie,
And short retirement urges sweet returne.
But other doubt possesses me, least harm
Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst
What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe
Envying our happiness, and of his own
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each
To other speedie aide might lend at need;
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss
Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects.
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.

To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve,
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd,

Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,
That such an Enemie we have, who seeks
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,
And from the parting Angel over-heard
As in a shadie nook I stood behind,
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.
But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt
To God or thee, because we have a foe
May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
His violence thou fearst not, being such,
As wee, not capable of death or paine,
Can either not receave, or can repell.
His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs
Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love
Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest
Adam, missthought of her to thee so dear?

To whom with healing words Adam replyd.
Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve,
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe.
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne
And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
If such affront I labour to avert
From thee alone, which on us both at once
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,
Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.
I from the influence of thy looks receave
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
Shame to be overcome or over-reacht
Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
When I am present, and thy trial choose
With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.

So spake domestick Adam in his care
And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought
Less attributed to her Faith sincere,
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.

If this be our condition, thus to dwell
In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,
Suttle or violent, we not endu'd
Single with like defence, wherever met,
How are we happie, still in fear of harm?
But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme
Sticks no dishonour on our Front, but turns
Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard
By us? who rather double honour gaine
From his surmise prov'd false, find peace within,
Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid
Alone, without exterior help sustaind?
Let us not then suspect our happie State
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,
As not secure to single or combin'd.
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,
And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd.

To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd.
O Woman, best are all things as the will
Of God ordain'd them, his creating hand
Nothing imperfet or deficient left
Of all that he Created, much less Man,
Or aught that might his happie State secure,
Secure from outward force; within himself
The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
Against his will he can receave no harme.
But God left free the Will, for what obeyes
Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,
But bid her well beware, and still erect,
Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd
She dictate false, and misinforme the Will
To do what God expressly hath forbid.
Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,
That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the Foe subornd,
And fall into deception unaware,
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.
Seek not temptation then, which to avoide
Were better, and most likelie if from mee
Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve
First thy obedience; th' other who can know,
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
But if thou think, trial unsought may finde
Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
Go in thy native innocence, relie
On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.
So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.

With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,
May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,
The willinger I goe, nor much expect
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light
Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine,
Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self
In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,
Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,
But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude,
Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought.
To Pales, or Pomona thus adornd,
Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled
Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime,
Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd
Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
Oft he to her his charge of quick returne
Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd
To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.
O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve,
Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!
Thou never from that houre in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;
Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades
Waited with hellish rancour imminent
To intercept thy way, or send thee back
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them
The whole included Race, his purposd prey.
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet
He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find
Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope
Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,
Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,
Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round
About her glowd, oft stooping to support
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,
Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,
From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh.
Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd
Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen
Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours
Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve:
Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd
Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd
Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son,
Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King
Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse.
Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.
As one who long in populous City pent,
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,
She most, and in her look summs all Delight.
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,
Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire
Of gesture or lest action overawd
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
That space the Evil one abstracted stood
From his own evil, and for the time remaind
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,
Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,
And tortures him now more, the more he sees
Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.

Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet
Compulsion thus transported to forget
What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,
Save what is in destroying, other joy
To me is lost.   Then let me not let pass
Occasion which now smiles, behold alone
The Woman, opportune to all attempts,
Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,
I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine
Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.
Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,
Not terrible, though terrour be in Love
And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,
Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,
The way which to her ruin now I tend.

So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve
Address'd his way, not with indented wave,
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd
Hermione and Cadmus, or the God
In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd
Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen,
Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore
Scipio the highth of Rome.   With tract oblique
At first, as one who sought access, but feard
To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;
So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd
To such disport before her through the Field,
From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd.
Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;
But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd
His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,
Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length
The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,
His fraudulent temptation thus began.

Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm
Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,
Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze
Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,
Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore
With ravishment beheld, there best beheld
Where universally admir'd; but here
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne
Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen
A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd
By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.

So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;
Into the Heart of Eve his words made way,
Though at the voice much marveling; at length
Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.
What may this mean?   Language of Man pronounc't
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?
The first at lest of these I thought deni'd
To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day
Created mute to all articulat sound;
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field
I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;
Redouble then this miracle, and say,
How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how
To me so friendly grown above the rest
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
Say, for such wonder claims attention due.

To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.
Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve,
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:
I was at first as other Beasts that graze
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,
As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:
Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,
Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense
Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.
To satisfie the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,
Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent
Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.
About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon,
For high from ground the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour
At Feed or Fountain never had I found.
Sated at length, ere long I might perceave
Strange alteration in me, to degree
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech
Wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd.
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind
Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;
But all that fair and good in thy Divine
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray
United I beheld; no Fair to thine
Equivalent or second, which compel'd
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come
And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.

So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve
Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd.

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?
For many are the Trees of God that grow
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
To us, in such aboundance lies our choice,
As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,
Still hanging incorruptible, till men
Grow up to thir provision, and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.

To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.
Empress, the way is readie, and not long,
Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,
Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past
Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.

Lead then, said Eve.   Hee leading swiftly rowld
In tangles, and made intricate seem strait,
To mischief swift.   Hope elevates, and joy
Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire,
Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night
Condenses, and the cold invirons round,
Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,
Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends
Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,
Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way
To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole,
There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.
So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud
Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree
Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.

Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,
Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess,
The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,
Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.
But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;
God so commanded, and left that Command
Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.

To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.
Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit
Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,
Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire?

To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit
Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,
But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst
The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate
Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.

She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold
The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love
To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,
Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act
Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.
As when of old som Orator renound
In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence
Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,
Stood in himself collected, while each part,
Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,
Somtimes in highth began, as no delay
Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown
The Tempter all impassiond thus began.

O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life
To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee,
Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
Is open? or will God incense his ire
For such a petty Trespass, and not praise
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain
Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd:
Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.
Why then was this forbid?   Why but to awe,
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,
His worshippers; he knows that in the day
Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then
Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,
Internal Man, is but proportion meet,
I of brute human, yee of human Gods.
So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off
Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,
Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring.
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they, participating God-like food?
The Gods are first, and that advantage use
On our belief, that all from them proceeds;
I question it, for this fair Earth I see,
Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree
Impart against his will if all be his?
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell
In heav'nly breasts? these, these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.

He ended, and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easie entrance won:
Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;
Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd
An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first
Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd.

Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,
Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir'd,
Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:
Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,
Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding
Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good
By thee communicated, and our want:
For good unknown, sure is not had, or had
And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
Such prohibitions binde not.   But if Death
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
Our inward freedom?   In the day we eate
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.
How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,
Irrational till then.   For us alone
Was death invented? or to us deni'd
This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy
The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.
What fear I then, rather what know to feare
Under this ignorance of good and Evil,
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,
That all was lost.   Back to the Thicket slunk
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true
Or fansied so, through expectation high
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.
Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,
And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,
Thus to her self she pleasingly began.

O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees
In Paradise, of operation blest
To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,
And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end
Created; but henceforth my early care,
Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise
Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease
Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;
Till dieted by thee I grow mature
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;
Though others envie what they cannot give;
For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here
Thus grown.   Experience, next to thee I owe,
Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind
In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,
And giv'st access, though secret she retire.
And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,
High and remote to see from thence distinct
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
May have diverted from continual watch
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies
About him.   But to Adam in what sort
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known
As yet my change, and give him to partake
Full happiness with mee, or rather not,
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power
Without Copartner? so to add what wants
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,
And render me more equal, and perhaps,
A thing not undesireable, somtime
Superior; for inferior who is free?
This may be well: but what if God have seen,
And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,
And Adam wedded to another Eve,
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
A death to think.   Confirm'd then I resolve;
Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:
So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
I could endure, without him live no life.

So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,
But first low Reverence don, as to the power
That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd
Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd
From Nectar, drink of Gods.   Adam the while
Waiting desirous her return, had wove
Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne
Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown,
As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.
Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new
Solace in her return, so long delay'd;
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;
And forth to meet her went, the way she took
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.
To him she hasted, in her face excuse
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,
Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.

Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay?
Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd
Thy presence, agonie of love till now
Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more
Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,
The pain of absence from thy sight.   But strange
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise,
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,
Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,
Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth
Endu'd with human voice and human sense,
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I
Have also tasted, and have also found
Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,
Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.
Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot
May joyne us, equal joy, as equal Love;
Least thou not tasting, different degree
Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce
Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.

Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told;
But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.
On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard
The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd,
Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill
Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;
From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve
Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:
Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
First to himself he inward silence broke.

O fairest of Creation, last and best
Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell'd
Whatever can to sight or thought be formd,
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,
Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?
Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
The strict forbiddance, how to violate
The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud
Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,
And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee
Certain my resolution is to Die;
How can I live without thee, how forgoe
Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,
To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?
Should God create another Eve, and I
Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart; no no, I feel
The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,
Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.
So having said, as one from sad dismay
Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd
Submitting to what seemd remediless,
Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd.

Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve,
And peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd
Had it been onely coveting to Eye
That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,
Much more to taste it under banne to touch.
But past who can recall, or don undoe?
Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact
Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,
Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first
Made common and unhallowd ere our taste;
Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives,
Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man
Higher degree of Life, inducement strong
To us, as likely tasting to attaine
Proportional ascent, which cannot be
But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,
Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,
For us created, needs with us must faile,
Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,
Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power
Creation could repeate, yet would be loath
Us to abolish, least the Adversary
Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God
Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first
He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?
Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe,
However I with thee have fixt my Lot,
Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death
Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;
So forcible within my heart I feel
The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
Our State cannot be severd, we are one,
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.

So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd.
O glorious trial of exceeding Love,
Illustrious evidence, example high!
Ingaging me to emulate, but short
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,
Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,
Direct, or by occasion hath presented
This happie trial of thy Love, which else
So eminently never had bin known.
Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue
This my attempt, I would sustain alone
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd
Remarkably so late of thy so true,
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel
Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life
Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
On my experience, Adam, freely taste,
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.

So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love
Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.
In recompence (for such compliance bad
Such recompence best merits) from the bough
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit
With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat
Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,
But fondly overcome with Femal charm.
Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,
Skie lowr'd and muttering Thunder, som sad drops
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin
Original; while Adam took no thought,
Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate
Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe
Him with her lov'd societie, that now
As with new Wine intoxicated both
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel
Divinitie within them breeding wings
Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit
Farr other operation first displaid,
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:
Till Adam thus'gan Eve to dalliance move,

Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,
And elegant, of Sapience no small part,
Since to each meaning savour we apply,
And Palate call judicious; I the praise
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now
True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,
For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.
But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,
As meet is, after such delicious Fare;
For never did thy Beautie since the day
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd
With all perfections, so enflame my sense
With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now
Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.

So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
Of amorous intent, well understood
Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.
Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd
He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,
Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,
And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.
There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport
Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,
The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep
Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.
Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,
That with exhilerating vapour bland
About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers
Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose
As from unrest, and each the other viewing,
Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds
How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile
Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,
Just confidence, and native righteousness
And honour from about them, naked left
To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe
Uncover'd more, so rose the Danite strong
Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap
Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd
Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare
Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face
Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute,
Till Adam, though not less then Eve abash't,
At length gave utterance to these words constraind.

Eve, in evil hour thou didst give eare
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught
To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,
False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes
Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know
Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got,
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,
Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,
Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,
Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,
And in our Faces evident the signes
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
Be sure then.   How shall I behold the face
Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy
And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes
Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze
Insufferably bright.   O might I here
In solitude live savage, in some glade
Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable
To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad
And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
Hide me, where I may never see them more.
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
What best may from the present serve to hide
The Parts of each for other, that seem most
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,
And girded on our loyns, may cover round
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.

So counsel'd hee, and both together went
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,
But such as at this day to Indians known
In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes
Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade
High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;
There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves
They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe,
And with what skill they had, together sowd,
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike
To that first naked Glorie.   Such of late
Columbus found th' American so girt
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.
Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part
Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,
They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares
Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within
Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,
Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore
Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once
And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:
For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now
To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe
Usurping over sovran Reason claimd
Superior sway: from thus distemperd brest,
Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd.

Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, and stai'd
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild
Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.

To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve.
What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe,
Imput'st thou that to my default, or will
Of wandring, as thou call'st it, which who knows
But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there,
Or here th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
No ground of enmitie between us known,
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme,
Was I to have never parted from thy side?
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head
Command me absolutely not to go,
Going into such danger as thou saidst?
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,
Nay didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,
Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee.

To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd,
Is this the Love, is this the recompence
Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,
Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,
Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:
And am I now upbraided, as the cause
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?
I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold
The danger, and",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45745/paradise-lost-book-9-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book 10 (1674 version),"MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act 
Of Satan done in Paradise, and how 
Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, 
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, 
Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye 
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart 
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, 
Hinder'd not Satan to attempt the minde 
Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd, 
Complete to have discover'd and repulst 
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. 
For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd 
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, 
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, 
Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, 
And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. 
Up into Heav'n from Paradise in haste 
Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad 
For Man, for of his state by this they knew, 
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln 
Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news 
From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd 
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare 
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt 
With pitie, violated not thir bliss. 
About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes 
Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know 
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream 
Accountable made haste to make appear 
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, 
And easily approv'd; when the most High 
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, 
Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. 
 
Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd 
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, 
Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth, 
Which your sincerest care could not prevent, 
Foretold so lately what would come to pass, 
When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell. 
I told ye then he should prevail and speed 
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't 
And flatter'd out of all, believing lies 
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine 
Concurring to necessitate his Fall, 
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse 
His free Will, to her own inclining left 
In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now 
What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass 
On his transgression, Death denounc't that day, 
Which he presumes already vain and void, 
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, 
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find 
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. 
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. 
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee 
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd 
All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth, or Hell. 
Easie it might be seen that I intend 
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee 
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd 
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, 
And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. 
 
So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright 
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son 
Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full 
Resplendent all his Father manifest 
Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. 
 
Father Eternal, thine is to decree, 
Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will 
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd 
Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge 
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, 
Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, 
When time shall be, for so I undertook 
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine 
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom 
On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so 
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most 
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. 
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none 
Are to behold the Judgment, but the judg'd, 
Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, 
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law 
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. 
 
Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose 
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, 
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant 
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence 
Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. 
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods 
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. 
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low 
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour 
To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in 
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole 
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both 
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard 
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes 
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard, 
And from his presence hid themselves among 
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God 
Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. 
 
Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet 
My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, 
Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, 
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: 
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change 
Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. 
He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first 
To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; 
Love was not in thir looks, either to God 
Or to each other, but apparent guilt, 
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, 
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. 
Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. 
 
I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice 
Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom 
The gracious judge without revile repli'd. 
 
My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, 
But still rejoyc't, how is it now become 
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who 
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree 
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? 
 
To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. 
O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand 
Before my judge, either to undergoe 
My self the total Crime, or to accuse 
My other self, the partner of my life; 
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, 
I should conceal, and not expose to blame 
By my complaint; but strict necessitie 
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint 
Least on my head both sin and punishment, 
However insupportable, be all 
Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou 
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. 
This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, 
And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, 
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, 
That from her hand I could suspect no ill, 
And what she did, whatever in it self, 
Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; 
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. 
 
To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. 
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey 
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, 
Superior, or but equal, that to her 
Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place 
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, 
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd 
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd 
Shee was indeed, and lovely to attract 
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts 
Were such as under Government well seem'd, 
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part 
And person, had'st thou known thy self aright. 
 
So having said, he thus to Eve in few: 
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? 
 
To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, 
Confessing soon, yet not before her judge 
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. 
 
The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. 
 
Which when the Lord God heard, without delay 
To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd 
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre 
The Guilt on him who made him instrument 
Of mischief, and polluted from the end 
Of his Creation; justly then accurst, 
As vitiated in Nature: more to know 
Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) 
Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last 
To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, 
Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: 
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. 
 
Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst 
Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; 
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, 
And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life. 
Between Thee and the Woman I will put 
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; 
Her Seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. 
 
So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd 
When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, 
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, 
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave 
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht 
In open shew, and with ascention bright 
Captivity led captive through the Aire, 
The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt, 
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; 
Eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, 
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. 
 
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie 
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring 
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will 
Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. 
 
On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. 
Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife, 
And eaten of the Tree concerning which 
I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, 
Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow 
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; 
Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth 
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, 
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, 
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou 
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, 
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. 
 
So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, 
And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day 
Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood 
Before him naked to the aire, that now 
Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin 
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume, 
As when he wash'd his servants feet so now 
As Father of his Familie he clad 
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, 
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; 
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: 
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins 
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more 
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, 
Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. 
To him with swift ascent he up returnd, 
Into his blissful bosom reassum'd 
In glory as of old, to him appeas'd 
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man 
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. 
Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, 
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, 
In counterview within the Gates, that now 
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame 
Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, 
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. 
 
O Son, why sit we here each other viewing 
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives 
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides 
For us his ofspring deare; It cannot be 
But that success attends him; if mishap, 
Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n 
By his Avenger, since no place like this 
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. 
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, 
Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large 
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, 
Or sympathie, or som connatural force 
Powerful at greatest distance to unite 
With secret amity things of like kinde 
By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade 
Inseparable must with mee along: 
For Death from Sin no power can separate. 
But least the difficultie of passing back 
Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe 
Impassable, Impervious, let us try 
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine 
Not unagreeable, to found a path 
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World 
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument 
Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, 
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, 
Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. 
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn 
By this new felt attraction and instinct. 
 
Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. 
Goe whither Fate and inclination strong 
Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre 
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw 
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste 
The savour of Death from all things there that live: 
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. 
 
So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell 
Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock 
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, 
Against the day of Battel, to a Field, 
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd 
With sent of living Carcasses design'd 
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. 
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd 
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, 
Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr. 
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste 
Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark 
Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great) 
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met 
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea 
Tost up and down, together crowded drove 
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. 
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse 
Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive 
Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way 
Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich 
Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle 
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, 
As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm 
As Delos floating once; the rest his look 
Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, 
And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, 
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach 
They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on 
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge 
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall 
Immovable of this now fenceless world 
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, 
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. 
So, if great things to small may be compar'd, 
Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, 
From Susa his Memnonian Palace high 
Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont 
Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, 
And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. 
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art 
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock 
Over the vext Abyss, following the track 
Of Satan, to the self same place where hee 
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe 
From out of Chaos to the out side bare 
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant 
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made 
And durable; and now in little space 
The confines met of Empyrean Heav'n 
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell 
With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes 
In sight, to each of these three places led. 
And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, 
To Paradise first tending, when behold 
Satan in likeness of an Angel bright 
Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing 
His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: 
Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear 
Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. 
Hee after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk 
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape 
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act 
By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded 
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought 
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend 
The Son of God to judge them terrifi'd 
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun 
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth 
Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd 
By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire 
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, 
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood 
Not instant, but of future time. With joy 
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, 
And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot 
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't 
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. 
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight 
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. 
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire 
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. 
 
O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, 
Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, 
Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: 
For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, 
My Heart, which by a secret harmonie 
Still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet, 
That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks 
Now also evidence, but straight I felt 
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt 
That I must after thee with this thy Son; 
Such fatal consequence unites us three: 
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, 
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure 
Detain from following thy illustrious track. 
Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd 
Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow'rd 
To fortifie thus farr, and overlay 
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. 
Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won 
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd 
With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd 
Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, 
There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, 
As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World 
Retiring, by his own doom alienated, 
And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide 
Of all things parted by th' Empyreal bounds, 
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, 
Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. 
 
Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. 
Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, 
High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race 
Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, 
Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) 
Amply have merited of me, of all 
Th' infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore 
Triumphal with triumphal act have met, 
Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm 
Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent 
Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I 
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease 
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint 
With these successes, and with them rejoyce, 
You two this way, among these numerous Orbs 
All yours, right down to Paradise descend; 
There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth 
Dominion exercise and in the Aire, 
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, 
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. 
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create 
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might 
Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now 
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, 
Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. 
If your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of Hell 
No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. 
 
So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed 
Thir course through thickest Constellations held 
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, 
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips 
Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down 
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side 
Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, 
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, 
That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, 
Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, 
And all about found desolate; for those 
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, 
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all 
Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls 
Of Pandaemonium, Citie and proud seate 
Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, 
Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. 
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand 
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance 
Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee 
Departing gave command, and they observ'd. 
As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe 
By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines 
Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes 
Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond 
The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate 
To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late 
Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell 
Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch 
Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting 
Each hour their great adventurer from the search 
Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, 
In shew Plebeian Angel militant 
Of lowest order, past; and from the dore 
Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible 
Ascended his high Throne, which under state 
Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end 
Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while 
He sate, and round about him saw unseen: 
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head 
And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad 
With what permissive glory since his fall 
Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd 
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng 
Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, 
Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: 
Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, 
Rais'd from thir Dark Divan, and with like joy 
Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand 
Silence, and with these words attention won. 
 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, 
For in possession such, not onely of right, 
I call ye and declare ye now, returnd 
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth 
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit 
Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, 
And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, 
As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven 
Little inferiour, by my adventure hard 
With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell 
What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine 
Voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep 
Of horrible confusion, over which 
By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd 
To expedite your glorious march; but I 
Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride 
Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb 
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, 
That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd 
My journey strange, with clamorous uproare 
Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found 
The new created World, which fame in Heav'n 
Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful 
Of absolute perfection, therein Man 
Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile 
Made happie; Him by fraud I have seduc'd 
From his Creator, and the more to increase 
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat 
Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up 
Both his beloved Man and all his World, 
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, 
Without our hazard, labour, or allarme, 
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man 
To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. 
True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather 
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape 
Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, 
Is enmity, which he will put between 
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; 
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: 
A World who would not purchase with a bruise, 
Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account 
Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, 
But up and enter now into full bliss. 
 
So having said, a while he stood, expecting 
Thir universal shout and high applause 
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears 
On all sides, from innumerable tongues 
A dismal universal hiss, the sound 
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long 
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; 
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, 
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining 
Each other, till supplanted down he fell 
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, 
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power 
Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, 
According to his doom: he would have spoke, 
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue 
To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd 
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories 
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din 
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now 
With complicated monsters head and taile, 
Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, 
Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, 
And Dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the Soil 
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle 
Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, 
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun 
Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, 
Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd 
Above the rest still to retain; they all 
Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, 
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout 
Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, 
Sublime with expectation when to see 
ln Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; 
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd 
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, 
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, 
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, 
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, 
And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form 
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, 
As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, 
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame 
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood 
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, 
His will who reigns above, to aggravate 
Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that 
Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve 
Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange 
Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining 
For one forbidden Tree a multitude 
Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; 
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, 
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, 
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees 
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks 
That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd 
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew 
Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; 
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste 
Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay 
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit 
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste 
With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, 
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, 
With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws 
With soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell 
Into the same illusion, not as Man 
Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd 
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, 
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, 
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo 
This annual humbling certain number'd days, 
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. 
However some tradition they dispers'd 
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, 
And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld 
Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- 
Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule 
Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n 
And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. 
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair 
Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, 
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell 
Habitual habitant; behind her Death 
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet 
On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. 
 
Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, 
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd 
With travail difficult, not better farr 
Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, 
Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? 
 
Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. 
To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, 
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, 
There best, where most with ravin I may meet; 
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems 
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. 
 
To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. 
Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours 
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, 
No homely morsels, and whatever thing 
The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, 
Till I in Man residing through the Race, 
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, 
And season him thy last and sweetest prey. 
 
This said, they both betook them several wayes, 
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make 
All kinds, and for destruction to mature 
Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, 
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, 
To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. 
 
See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance 
To waste and havoc yonder World, which I 
So fair and good created, and had still 
Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man 
Let in these wastful Furies, who impute 
Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell 
And his Adherents, that with so much ease 
I suffer them to enter and possess 
A place so heav'nly, and conniving-seem 
To gratifie my scornful Enemies, 
That laugh, as if transported with some fit 
Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, 
At random yielded up to their misrule; 
And know not that I call'd and drew them thither 
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth 
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed 
On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst 
With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling 
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, 
Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last 
Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell 
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. 
Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure 
To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: 
Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. 
 
He ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud 
Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, 
Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, 
Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; 
Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, 
Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom 
New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, 
Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, 
While the Creator calling forth by name 
His mightie Angels gave them several charge, 
As sorted best with present things. The Sun 
Had first his precept so to move, so shine, 
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat 
Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call 
Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring 
Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone 
Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five 
Thir planetarie motions and aspects 
In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, 
Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne 
In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt 
Thir influence malignant when to showre, 
Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, 
Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set 
Thir corners, when with bluster to confound 
Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle 
With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. 
Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse 
The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more 
From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd 
Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun 
Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode 
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n 
Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins 
Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine 
By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, 
As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change 
Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring 
Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, 
Equal in Days and Nights, except to those 
Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day 
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun 
To recompence his distance, in thir sight 
Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known 
Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow 
From cold Estotiland, and South as farr 
Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit 
The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd 
His course intended; else how had the World 
Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, 
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? 
These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd 
Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, 
Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, 
Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North 
Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar 
Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice 
And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, 
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud 
And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; 
With adverse blast upturns them from the South 
Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds 
From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce 
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes 
Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, 
Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began 
Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first 
Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, 
Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: 
Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle, 
And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, 
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe 
Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim 
Glar'd on him passing: these were from without 
The growing miseries, which Adam saw 
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, 
To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, 
And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, 
Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. 
 
O miserable of happie! is this the end 
Of this new glorious World, and mee so late 
The Glory of that Glory, who now becom 
Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face 
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth 
Of happiness: yet well, if here would end 
The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare 
My own deservings; but this will not serve; 
All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, 
Is propagated curse. O voice once heard 
Delightfully, Encrease and multiply, 
Now death to heare! for what can I encrease 
Or multiplie, but curses on my head? 
Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling 
The evil on him brought by me, will curse 
My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, 
For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks 
Shall be the execration; so besides 
Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee 
Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, 
On mee as on thir natural center light 
Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes 
Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! 
Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay 
To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee 
From darkness to promote me, or here place 
In this delicious Garden? as my Will 
Concurd not to my being, it were but right 
And equal to reduce me to my dust, 
Desirous to resigne, and render back 
All I receav'd, unable to performe 
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold 
The good I sought not. To the loss of that, 
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added 
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable 
Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, 
I thus contest; then should have been refusd 
Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: 
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, 
Then cavil the conditions? and though God 
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son 
Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, 
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: 
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee 
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, 
But Natural necessity begot. 
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own 
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, 
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. 
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, 
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: 
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes 
His hand to execute what his Decree 
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, 
Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out 
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet 
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth 
Insensible, how glad would lay me down 
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest 
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more 
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse 
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me 
With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt 
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, 
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man 
Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish 
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, 
Or in some other dismal place who knows 
But I shall die a living Death? O thought 
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath 
Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life 
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. 
All of me then shall die: let this appease 
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. 
For though the Lord of all be infinite, 
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, 
But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise 
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? 
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make 
Strange contradiction, which to God himself 
Impossible is held, as Argument 
Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, 
For angers sake, finite to infinite 
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour 
Satisfi'd never; that were to extend 
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, 
By which all Causes else according still 
To the reception of thir matter act, 
Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say 
That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, 
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie 
From this day onward, which 1 feel begun 
Both in me, and without me, and so last 
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear 
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution 
On my defensless head; both Death and I 
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, 
Nor I on my part single, in mee all 
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie 
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able 
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! 
So disinherited how would ye bless 
Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind 
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, 
If guiltless? But from me what can proceed, 
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, 
Not to do onely, but to will the same 
With me? how can they then acquitted stand 
In sight of God? Him after all Disputes 
Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain, 
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still 
But to my own conviction: first and last 
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring 
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; 
So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support 
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear 
Then all the World much heavier, though divided 
With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st 
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope 
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable 
Beyond all past example and future, 
To Satan only like both crime and doom. 
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears 
And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which 
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! 
 
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud 
Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell, 
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air 
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, 
Which to his evil Conscience represented 
All things with double terror: On the Ground 
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft 
Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd 
Of tardie execution, since denounc't 
The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, 
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke 
To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, 
Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? 
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine 
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. 
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, 
With other echo late I taught your Shades 
To answer, and resound farr other Song. 
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld, 
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, 
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: 
But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. 
 
Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best 
Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false 
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, 
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew 
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee 
Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended 
To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee 
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride 
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, 
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd 
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen 
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening 
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting 
Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, 
To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, 
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, 
And understood not all was but a shew 
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib 
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, 
More to the part sinister from me drawn, 
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie 
To my just number found. O why did God, 
Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n 
With Spirits Masculine, create at last 
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect 
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once 
With Men as Angels without Feminine, 
Or find some other way to generate 
Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, 
And more that shall befall, innumerable 
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, 
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either 
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such 
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, 
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain 
Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind 
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld 
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late 
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound 
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: 
Which infinite calamitie shall cause 
To Humane life, and houshold peace confound. 
 
He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve 
Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, 
And tresses all disorderd, at his feet 
Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught 
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. 
 
Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n 
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart 
I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, 
Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant 
I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, 
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, 
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, 
My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, 
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? 
While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, 
Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, 
As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie 
Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, 
That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not 
Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, 
On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self 
More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou 
Against God onely, I against God and thee, 
And to the place of judgment will return, 
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all 
The sentence from thy head remov'd may light 
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, 
Mee mee onely just object of his ire. 
 
She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, 
Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault 
Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught 
Commiseration; soon his heart relented 
Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, 
Now at his feet submissive in distress, 
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, 
His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; 
As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, 
And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. 
 
Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, 
So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st 
The punishment all on thy self; alas, 
Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine 
His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, 
And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers 
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place 
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, 
That on my head all might be visited, 
Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, 
To me committed and by me expos'd. 
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame 
Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive 
In offices of Love, how we may light'n 
Each others burden in our share of woe; 
Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, 
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, 
A long days dying to augment our paine, 
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. 
 
To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. 
Adam, by sad experiment I know 
How little weight my words with thee can finde, 
Found so erroneous, thence by just event 
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, 
Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place 
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine 
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart 
Living or dying, from thee I will not hide 
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, 
Tending to some relief of our extremes, 
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, 
As in our evils, and of easier choice. 
If care of our descent perplex us most, 
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd 
By Death at last, and miserable it is 
To be to others cause of misery, 
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring 
Into this cursed World a woful Race, 
That after wretched Life must be at last 
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power 
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent 
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. 
Childless thou art, Childless remaine: so Death 
Shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two 
Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. 
But if thou judge it hard and difficult, 
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain 
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet, 
And with desire to languish without hope, 
Before the present object languishing 
With like desire, which would be meserie 
And torment less then none of what we dread, 
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free 
From what we fear for both, let us make short, 
Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply 
With our own hands his Office on our selves; 
Why stand we longer shivering under feares, 
That shew no end but Death, and have the power, 
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, 
Destruction with destruction to destroy. 
 
She ended heer, or vehement despaire 
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts 
Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. 
But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, 
To better hopes his more attentive minde 
Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. 
 
Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems 
To argue in thee somthing more sublime 
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; 
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes 
That excellence thought in thee, and implies, 
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret 
For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. 
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end 
Of miserie, so thinking to evade 
The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God 
Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so 
To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death 
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine 
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts 
Of contumacie will provoke the highest 
To make death in us live: Then let us seek 
Some safer resolution, which methinks 
I have in view, calling to minde with heed 
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise 
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless 
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe 
Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd 
Against us this deceit: to crush his head 
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost 
By death brought on our selves, or childless days 
Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe 
Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee 
Instead shall double ours upon our heads. 
No more be mention'd then of violence 
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, 
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely 
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, 
Reluctance against God and his just yoke 
Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild 
And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd 
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected 
Immediate dissolution, which we thought 
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee 
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, 
And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, 
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope 
Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne 
My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; 
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold 
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care 
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands 
Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; 
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear 
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, 
And teach us further by what means to shun 
Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, 
Which now the Skie with various Face begins 
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds 
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks 
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek 
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish 
Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr 
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams 
Reflected, may with matter sere foment, 
Or by collision of two bodies grinde 
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds 
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock 
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down 
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, 
And sends a comfortable heat from farr, 
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, 
And what may else be remedie or cure 
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, 
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace 
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear 
To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd 
By him with many comforts, till we end 
In dust, our final rest and native home. 
What better can we do, then to the place 
Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall 
Before him reverent, and there confess 
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears 
Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air 
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign 
Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. 
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn 
From his displeasure; in whose look serene, 
When angry most he seem'd and most severe, 
What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? 
 
So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve 
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place 
Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell 
Before him reverent, and both confess'd 
Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears 
Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air 
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign 
Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45746/paradise-lost-book-10-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book 11 (1674 version),"Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd
The stonie from thir hearts, & made new flesh
Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath'd
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port
Not of mean suiters, nor important less
Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine
Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers
Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passd
Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
Presenting, thus to intercede began.

See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees
Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n
From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;
Unskilful with what words to pray, Iet mee
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate
And propitiation, all his works on mee
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.
Accept me, and in mee from these receave
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live
Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,
Made one with me as I with thee am one.

To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:
But longer in that Paradise to dwell,
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:
Those pure immortal Elements that know
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,
And mortal food, as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt
Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts
Created him endowd, with Happiness
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,
This other serv'd but to eternize woe;
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes
His final remedie, and after Life
Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,
Wak't in the renovation of the just,
Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.
But let us call to Synod all the Blest
Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide
My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,
As how with peccant Angels late they saw;
And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.

He ended, and the Son gave signal high
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew
His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
When God descended, and perhaps once more
To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs
Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,
By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream
Th' Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will.

O Sons, like one of us Man is become
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,
Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known
Good by it self, and Evil not at all.
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,
My motions in him, longer then they move,
His heart I know, how variable and vain
Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
And live for ever, dream at least to live
For ever, to remove him I decree,
And send him from the Garden forth to Till
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.

Michael, this my behest have thou in charge,
Take to thee from among the Cherubim
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
Vacant possession som new trouble raise:
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,
From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce
To them and to thir Progenie from thence
Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,
For I behold them softn'd and with tears
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.
If patiently thy bidding they obey,
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale
To Adam what shall come in future dayes,
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix
My Cov'nant in the womans seed renewd;
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
And on the East side of the Garden place,
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:
Least Paradise a receptacle prove
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,
With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.

He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape
Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those
Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,
Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while
To resalute the World with sacred Light
Leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd
The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found
Strength added from above, new hope to spring
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd.

Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all
The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends;
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n
So prevalent as to concerne the mind
Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne
Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught
By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,
Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,
Methought I saw him placable and mild,
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd
Home to my Brest, and to my memorie
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now
Assures me that the bitterness of death
Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,
Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,
Mother of all things living, since by thee
Man is to live, and all things live for Man.

To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
Ill worthie I such title should belong
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't
The sourse of life; next favourable thou,
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st,
Farr other name deserving. But the Field
To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,
All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,
I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?
Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.

So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate
Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour,
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;
Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.
Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase
Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake.

O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,
Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn
Us haply too secure of our discharge
From penaltie, because from death releast
Some days; how long, and what till then our life,
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,
And thither must return and be no more.
Why else this double object in our fight
Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground
One way the self-same hour? why in the East
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light
More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws
O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,
And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.

He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd
In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,
Against the Syrian King, who to surprize
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,
Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise
Possession of the Garden; hee alone,
To find where Adam shelterd, took his way,
Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve,
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.

Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
Of us will soon determin, or impose
New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill
One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate
None of the meanest, some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,
As Raphael, that I should much confide,
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes
A militarie Vest of purple flowd
Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine
Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old
In time of Truce; lris had dipt the wooff;
His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side
As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword,
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.
Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State
Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.

Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
Defeated of his seisure many dayes
Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime;
But longer in this Paradise to dwell
Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
And send thee from the Garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.

He added not, for Adam at the newes
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
Yet all had heard, with audible lament
Discover'd soon the place of her retire.

O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day
That must be mortal to us both. O flours,
That never will in other Climate grow,
My early visitation, and my last
At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand
From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke
Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee
How shall I part, and whither wander down
Into a lower World, to this obscure
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?

Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.
Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,
Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine;
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
Where he abides, think there thy native soile.

Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,
To Michael thus his humble words addressd.

Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
And in performing end us; what besides
Of sorrow and dejection and despair
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,
Departure from this happy place, our sweet
Recess, and onely consolation left
Familiar to our eyes, all places else
Inhospitable appeer and desolate,
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of him who all things can, I would not cease
To wearie him with my assiduous cries:
But prayer against his absolute Decree
No more availes then breath against the winde,
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
This most afflicts me, that departing hence,
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd
His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:
So many grateful Altars I would reare
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,
Or monument to Ages, and thereon
Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours:
In yonder nether World where shall I seek
His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.

To whom thus Michael with regard benigne.
Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth.
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
No despicable gift; surmise not then
His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd
Of Paradise or Eden: this had been
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred
All generations, and had hither come
From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in plaine
God is as here, and will be found alike
Present, and of his presence many a signe
Still following thee, still compassing thee round
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
True patience, and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow, equally enur'd
By moderation either state to beare,
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure
Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend
This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes)
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.

To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd.
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,
However chast'ning, to the evil turne
My obvious breast, arming to overcom
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,
If so I may attain.   So both ascend
In the Visions of God: It was a Hill
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken
Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
Our second Adam in the Wilderness,
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.
His Eye might there command wherever stood
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls
Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can
And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,
To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
Down to the golden Chersonese, or where
The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since
In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar
In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,
Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port
Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings
Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme
Of Congo, and Angola fardest South;
Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount
The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,
Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;
On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,
And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd
Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons
Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights
Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd
Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight
Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd.
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,
That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes,
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.

Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold
Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd
Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,
Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.

His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;
Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,
Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n
Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;
The others not, for his was not sincere;
Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.

O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n
To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?

T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.
These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come
Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,
For envie that his Brothers Offering found
From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact
Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
Rowling in dust and gore.   To which our Sire.

Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!
But have I now seen Death? Is this the way
I must return to native dust? O sight
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!

To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen
In his first shape on man; but many shapes
Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
More terrible at th' entrance then within.
Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more
In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know
What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve
Shall bring on men.   Immediately a place
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid
Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,
Daemoniac Phrenzie, moaping Melancholie
And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie,
Marasmus, and wide-wasting Pestilence,
Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;
And over them triumphant Death his Dart
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,
Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.

O miserable Mankind, to what fall
Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd!
Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n
To be thus wrested from us? rather why
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
What we receive, would either not accept
Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,
Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus
Th' Image of God in man created once
So goodly and erect, though faultie since,
To such unsightly sufferings be debas't
Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,
Retaining still Divine similitude
In part, from such deformities be free,
And for his Makers Image sake exempt?

Thir Makers Image,   answerd Michael, then
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd
To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took
His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
Therefore so abject is thir punishment,
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,
Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.

I yield it just,   said Adam,   and submit.
But is there yet no other way, besides
These painful passages, how we may come
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust;

There is,   said Michael,   if thou well observe
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
Till many years over thy head return:
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:
This is old age; but then thou must outlive
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne
A Melancholy damp of cold and dry
To weigh thy Spirits down, and last consume
The Balme of Life.   To whom our Ancestor.

Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong
Life much, bent rather how I may be quit
Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,
Which I must keep till my appointed day
Of rendring up, and patiently attend
My dissolution.   Michael repli'd.

Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst
Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:
And now prepare thee for another sight.

He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound
Of Instruments that made melodious chime
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
Instinct through all proportions low and high
Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.
In other part stood one who at the Forge
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought
Fusil or grav'n in mettle. After these,
But on the hether side a different sort
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent
To worship God aright, and know his works
Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;
And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.
Such happy interview and fair event
Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart
Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight,
The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.

True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.

To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
Created, as thou art, to nobler end
Holie and pure, conformitie divine.
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
Who slew his Brother; studious they appere
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
Yet empty of all good wherein consists
Womans domestic honour and chief praise;
Bred onely and completed to the taste
Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,
Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame
Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
(Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.

To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.
O pittie and shame, that they who to live well
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
But still I see the tenor of Mans woe
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.

From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place
By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav'd.
But now prepare thee for another Scene.

He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
Single or in Array of Battel rang'd
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;
One way a Band select from forage drives
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,
But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray;
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;
Where Cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd lies
With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong
Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,
Assaulting; others from the wall defend
With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
In other part the scepter'd Haralds call
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
In factious opposition, till at last
Of middle Age one rising, eminent
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
And Judgment from above: him old and young
Exploded and had seiz'd with violent hands,
Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence
Unseen amid the throng: so violence
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
Inhumanly to men, and multiply
Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew
His Brother; for of whom such massacher
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n
Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?

To whom thus Michael. These are the product
Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw'st;
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,
And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;
To overcome in Battle, and subdue
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done
Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.
Thus Fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on Earth,
And what most merits fame in silence hid.
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
The onely righteous in a World perverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so beset
With Foes for daring single to be just,
And utter odious Truth, that God would come
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.

He look'd, and saw the face of things quite chang'd,
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.
At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,
And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
In Prison under Judgements imminent:
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd
Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
Measur'd by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth,
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!
Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
Thir order: last the Sire, and his three Sons
With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore.
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain
Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd
And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.
How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
Depopulation; thee another Floud,
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
His Children, all in view destroyd at once;
And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.

O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot
Anough to beare; those now, that were dispenst
The burd'n of many Ages, on me light
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,
With thought that they must be. Let no man seek
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
And hee the future evil shall no less
In apprehension then in substance feel
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't
Famin and anguish will at last consume
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope
When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd
With length of happy dayes the race of man;
But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,
And whether here the Race of man will end.
To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst
In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
First seen in acts of prowess eminent
And great exploits, but of true vertu void;
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.
The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear
More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
One Man except, the onely Son of light
In a dark Age, against example good,
Against allurement, custom, and a World
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes
Shall them admonish, and before them set
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come
On thir impenitence; and shall returne
Of them derided, but of God observd
The one just Man alive; by his command
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,
To save himself and household from amidst
A World devote to universal rack.
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts
Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre
Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,
With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift
Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,
And there take root an Iland salt and bare,
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
To teach thee that God attributes to place
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
And now what further shall ensue, behold.

He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie
Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass
Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt
His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,
And after him, the surer messenger,
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
The second time returning, in his Bill
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
Conspicuous with three listed colours gay,
Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.
Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.

O thou who future things canst represent
As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive
At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live
With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.
Farr less I now lament for one whole World
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce
For one Man found so perfet and so just,
That God voutsafes to raise another World
From him, and all his anger to forget.
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,
Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,
Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?

To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;
So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,
Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw
The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
And makes a Covenant never to destroy
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look
And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,
Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45747/paradise-lost-book-11-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Lost: Book 12 (1674 version),"AS one who in his journey bates at Noone, 
Though bent on speed, so heer the Archangel paus'd 
Betwixt the world destroy'd and world restor'd, 
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; 
Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes. 
 
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; 
And Man as from a second stock proceed. 
Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave 
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine 
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: 
Henceforth what is to com I will relate, 
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. 
This second sours of Men, while yet but few; 
And while the dread of judgement past remains 
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, 
With some regard to what is just and right 
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, 
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, 
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, 
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, 
With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast, 
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell 
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes 
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise 
Of proud ambitious heart, who not content 
With fair equalitie, fraternal state, 
Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd 
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess 
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; 
Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) 
With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse 
Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: 
A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd 
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n, 
Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie; 
And from Rebellion shall derive his name, 
Though of Rebellion others he accuse. 
Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns 
With him or under him to tyrannize, 
Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde 
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge 
Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; 
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build 
A Citie and Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n; 
And get themselves a name, least far disperst 
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost 
Regardless whether good or evil fame. 
But God who oft descends to visit men 
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks 
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, 
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower 
Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets 
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase 
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead 
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: 
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud 
Among the Builders; each to other calls 
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, 
As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n 
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange 
And hear the din; thus was the building left 
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd. 
 
Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd. 
O execrable Son so to aspire 
Above his Brethren, to himself assuming 
Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n: 
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl 
Dominion absolute; that right we hold 
By his donation; but Man over men 
He made not Lord; such title to himself 
Reserving, human left from human free. 
But this Usurper his encroachment proud 
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends 
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food 
Will he convey up thither to sustain 
Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire 
Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, 
And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? 
 
To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st 
That Son, who on the quiet state of men 
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue 
Rational Libertie; yet know withall, 
Since thy original lapse, true Libertie 
Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells 
Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being: 
Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd, 
Immediately inordinate desires 
And upstart Passions catch the Government 
From Reason, and to servitude reduce 
Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits 
Within himself unworthie Powers to reign 
Over free Reason, God in judgement just 
Subjects him from without to violent Lords; 
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall 
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, 
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. 
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low 
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, 
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext 
Deprives them of thir outward libertie, 
Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son 
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame 
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, 
Servant of Seruants, on his vitious Race. 
Thus will this latter, as the former World, 
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last 
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw 
His presence from among them, and avert 
His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth 
To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; 
And one peculiar Nation to select 
From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd, 
A Nation from one faithful man to spring: 
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, 
Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men 
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, 
While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood, 
As to forsake the living God, and fall 
To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone 
For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes 
To call by Vision from his Fathers house, 
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land 
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise 
A mightie Nation, and upon him showre 
His benediction so, that in his Seed 
All Nations shall be blest; he straight obeys, 
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: 
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith 
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile 
Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the Ford 
To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train 
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; 
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth 
With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown. 
Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents 
Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine 
Of Moreh; there by promise he receaves 
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; 
From Hamath Northward to the Desert South 
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd) 
From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, 
Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold 
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare 
Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream 
Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons 
Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills. 
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth 
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed 
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise 
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon 
Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, 
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, 
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, 
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; 
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs 
From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call'd 
Egypt, divided by the River Nile; 
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes 
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land 
He comes invited by a yonger Son 
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds 
Raise him to be the second in that Realme 
Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race 
Growing into a Nation, and now grown 
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks 
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests 
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves 
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: 
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call 
Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime 
His people from enthralment, they return 
With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land. 
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies 
To know thir God, or message to regard, 
Must be compelld by Signes and judgements dire; 
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, 
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill 
With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land; 
His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, 
Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, 
And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, 
Haile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian Skie 
And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls; 
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, 
A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down 
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: 
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, 
Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; 
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born 
Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds 
The River-dragon tam'd at length submits 
To let his sojourners depart, and oft 
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice 
More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage 
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea 
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass 
As on drie land between two christal walls, 
Aw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand 
Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar: 
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, 
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe 
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, 
By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire, 
To guide them in thir journey, and remove 
Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues: 
All night he will pursue, but his approach 
Darkness defends between till morning Watch; 
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud 
God looking forth will trouble all his Host 
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command 
Moses once more his potent Rod extends 
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; 
On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, 
And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect 
Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance 
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, 
Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd 
Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare 
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather 
Inglorious life with servitude; for life 
To noble and ignoble is more sweet 
Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. 
This also shall they gain by thir delay 
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found 
Thir government, and thir great Senate choose 
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: 
God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top 
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself 
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound 
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine 
To civil Justice, part religious Rites 
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types 
And shadows, of that destind Seed to bruise 
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve 
Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God 
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech 
That Moses might report to them his will, 
And terror cease; he grants what they besaught 
Instructed that to God is no access 
Without Mediator, whose high Office now 
Moses in figure beares, to introduce 
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, 
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times 
Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites 
Establisht, such delight hath God in Men 
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes 
Among them to set up his Tabernacle, 
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: 
By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd 
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein 
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, 
The Records of his Cov'nant, over these 
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings 
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn 
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing 
The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud 
Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleame by Night, 
Save when they journie, and at length they come, 
Conducted by his Angel to the Land 
Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest 
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, 
How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, 
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still 
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, 
Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand, 
And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon, 
Till Israel overcome; so call the third 
From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him 
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. 
 
Here Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n, 
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things 
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne 
Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde 
Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd, 
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom 
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see 
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, 
Favour unmerited by me, who sought 
Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means. 
This yet I apprehend not, why to those 
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth 
So many and so various Laws are giv'n; 
So many Laws argue so many sins 
Among them; how can God with such reside? 
 
To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin 
Will reign among them, as of thee begot; 
And therefore was Law given them to evince 
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up 
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see 
Law can discover sin, but not remove, 
Save by those shadowie expiations weak, 
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude 
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, 
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness 
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde 
Justification towards God, and peace 
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies 
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part 
Perform, and not performing cannot live. 
So law appears imperfet, and but giv'n 
With purpose to resign them in full time 
Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd 
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, 
From imposition of strict Laws, to free 
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear 
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. 
And therefore shall not Moses, though of God 
Highly belov'd, being but the Minister 
Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; 
But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, 
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell 
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back 
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man 
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. 
Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't 
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins 
National interrupt thir public peace, 
Provoking God to raise them enemies: 
From whom as oft he saves them penitent 
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom 
The second, both for pietie renownd 
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive 
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne 
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing 
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock 
Of David (so I name this King) shall rise 
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, 
Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust 
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings 
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. 
But first a long succession must ensue, 
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd, 
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents 
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. 
Such follow him, as shall be registerd 
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, 
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults 
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense 
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, 
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark 
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey 
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st 
Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd. 
There in captivitie he lets them dwell 
The space of seventie years, then brings them back, 
Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn 
To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n. 
Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings 
Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God 
They first re-edifie, and for a while 
In mean estate live moderate, till grown 
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; 
But first among the Priests dissension springs, 
Men who attend the Altar, and should most 
Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings 
Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise 
The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, 
Then loose it to a stranger, that the true 
Anointed King Messiah might be born 
Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr 
Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com, 
And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire 
His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; 
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells 
To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; 
They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire 
Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. 
A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire 
The Power of the most High; he shall ascend 
The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign 
With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns. 
 
He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy 
Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears, 
Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. 
 
O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher 
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand 
What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, 
Why our great expectation should be call'd 
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, 
High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes 
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son 
Of God most High; So God with man unites. 
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise 
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when 
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. 
 
To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, 
As of a Duel, or the local wounds 
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son 
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil 
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome 
Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise, 
Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound: 
Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, 
Not by destroying Satan, but his works 
In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, 
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, 
Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd 
On penaltie of death, and suffering death, 
The penaltie to thy transgression due, 
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: 
So onely can high Justice rest appaid. 
The Law of God exact he shall fulfill 
Both by obedience and by love, though love 
Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment 
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh 
To a reproachful life and cursed death, 
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe 
In his redemption, and that his obedience 
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits 
To save them, not thir own, though legal works. 
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, 
Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd 
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross 
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; 
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, 
The Law that is against thee, and the sins 
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, 
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust 
In this his satisfaction; so he dies, 
But soon revives, Death over him no power 
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light 
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise 
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, 
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, 
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life 
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace 
By Faith not void of workes: this God-like act 
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, 
In sin for ever lost from life; this act 
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength 
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, 
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings 
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, 
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, 
A gentle wafting to immortal Life. 
Nor after resurrection shall he stay 
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer 
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life 
Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge 
To teach all nations what of him they learn'd 
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve 
Baptizing in the profluent stream, the signe 
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life 
Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, 
For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd. 
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day 
Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines 
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons 
Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; 
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. 
Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend 
With victory, triumphing through the aire 
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise 
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines 
Through all his Realme, and there confounded leave; 
Then enter into glory, and resume 
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high 
Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come, 
When this worlds disolution shall be ripe, 
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead, 
To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward 
His faithful, and receave them into bliss, 
Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth 
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place 
Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. 
 
So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd, 
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire 
Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. 
 
O goodness infinite, goodness immense! 
That all this good of evil shall produce, 
And evil turn to good; more wonderful 
Then that which by creation first brought forth 
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, 
Whether I should repent me now of sin 
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce 
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, 
To God more glory, more good will to Men 
From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. 
But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n 
Must reascend, what will betide the few 
His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, 
The enemies of truth; who then shall guide 
His people, who defend? will they not deale 
Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? 
 
Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n 
Hee to his own a Comforter will send, 
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell 
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith 
Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, 
To guide them in all truth, and also arme 
With spiritual Armour, able to resist 
Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts, 
What man can do against them, not affraid, 
Though to the death, against such cruelties 
With inward consolations recompenc't, 
And oft supported so as shall amaze 
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit 
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends 
To evangelize the Nations, then on all 
Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue 
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, 
As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win 
Great numbers of each Nation to receave 
With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length 
Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run, 
Thir doctrine and thir story written left, 
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, 
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, 
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n 
To thir own vile advantages shall turne 
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth 
With superstitions and traditions taint, 
Left onely in those written Records pure, 
Though not but by the Spirit understood. 
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, 
Places and titles, and with these to joine 
Secular power, though feigning still to act 
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating 
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n 
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, 
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force 
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde 
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within 
Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then 
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde 
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild 
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, 
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth 
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard 
Infallible? yet many will presume: 
Whence heavie persecution shall arise 
On all who in the worship persevere 
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, 
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes 
Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire 
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith 
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, 
To good malignant, to bad men benigne, 
Under her own waight groaning till the day 
Appeer of respiration to the just, 
And vengeance to the wicked, at return 
Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid 
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, 
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, 
Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald 
In glory of the Father, to dissolve 
Satan with his perverted World, then raise 
From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, 
New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date 
Founded in righteousness and peace and love 
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. 
 
He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd. 
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, 
Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time, 
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, 
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. 
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, 
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill 
Of knowledge, what this Vessel can containe; 
Beyond which was my folly to aspire. 
Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, 
And love with fear the onely God, to walk 
As in his presence, ever to observe 
His providence, and on him sole depend, 
Mercifull over all his works, with good 
Still overcoming evil, and by small 
Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak 
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise 
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake 
Is fortitude to highest victorie, 
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; 
Taught this by his example whom I now 
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. 
 
To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd: 
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe 
Of wisdome; hope no higher, though all the Starrs 
Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers, 
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, 
Or works of God in Heav'n, Aire, Earth, or Sea, 
And all the riches of this World enjoydst, 
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add 
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, 
Add vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, 
By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul 
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath 
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess 
A paradise within thee, happier farr. 
Let us descend now therefore from this top 
Of Speculation; for the hour precise 
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, 
By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect 
Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, 
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; 
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; 
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd 
Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd 
To meek submission: thou at season fit 
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, 
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, 
The great deliverance by her Seed to come 
(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. 
That ye may live, which will be many dayes, 
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, 
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd 
With meditation on the happie end. 
 
He ended, and they both descend the Hill; 
Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve 
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; 
And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. 
 
Whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know; 
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, 
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good 
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress 
Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; 
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, 
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, 
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee 
Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, 
Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. 
This further consolation yet secure 
I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, 
Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, 
By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. 
 
So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard 
Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh 
Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill 
To thir fixt Station, all in bright array 
The Cherubim descended; on the ground 
Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist 
Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides, 
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel 
Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't, 
The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd 
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, 
And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, 
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat 
In either hand the hastning Angel caught 
Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate 
Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast 
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd. 
They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld 
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, 
Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate 
With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes: 
Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; 
The World was all before them, where to choose 
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: 
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, 
Through Eden took thir solitarie way.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45748/paradise-lost-book-12-1674-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Regain'd: Book 1 (1671 version),"I Who e're while the happy Garden sung, 
By one mans disobedience lost, now sing 
Recover'd Paradise to all mankind, 
By one mans firm obedience fully tri'd 
Through all temptation, and the Tempter foil'd 
In all his wiles, defeated and repuls't, 
And Eden rais'd in the wast Wilderness. 
   Thou Spirit who ledst this glorious Eremite 
Into the Desert, his Victorious Field 
Against the Spiritual Foe, and broughtst him thence 
By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire, 
As thou art wont, my prompted Song else mute, 
And bear through highth or depth of natures bounds 
With prosperous wing full summ'd to tell of deeds 
Above Heroic, though in secret done, 
And unrecorded left through many an Age, 
Worthy t'have not remain'd so long unsung. 
   Now had the great Proclaimer with a voice 
More awful then the sound of Trumpet, cri'd 
Repentance, and Heavens Kingdom nigh at hand 
To all Baptiz'd: to his great Baptism flock'd 
With aw the Regions round, and with them came 
From Nazareth the Son of Joseph deem'd 
To the flood Jordan, came as then obscure, 
Unmarkt, unknown; but him the Baptist soon 
Descri'd, divinely warn'd, and witness bore 
As to his worthier, and would have resign'd 
To him his Heavenly Office, nor was long 
His witness unconfirm'd: on him baptiz'd 
Heaven open'd, and in likeness of a Dove 
The Spirit descended, while the Fathers voice 
From Heav'n pronounc'd him his beloved Son. 
That heard the Adversary, who roving still 
About the world, at that assembly fam'd 
Would not be last, and with the voice divine 
Nigh Thunder-struck, th' exalted man, to whom 
Such high attest was giv'n, a while survey'd 
With wonder, then with envy fraught and rage 
Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air 
To Councel summons all his mighty Peers, 
Within thick Clouds and dark ten-fold involv'd, 
A gloomy Consistory; and them amidst 
With looks agast and sad he thus bespake. 
   O ancient Powers of Air and this wide world, 
For much more willingly I mention Air, 
This our old Conquest, then remember Hell 
Our hated habitation; well ye know 
How many Ages, as the years of men, 
This Universe we have possest, and rul'd 
In manner at our will th' affairs of Earth, 
Since Adam and his facil consort Eve 
Lost Paradise deceiv'd by me, though since 
With dread attending when that fatal wound 
Shall be inflicted by the Seed of Eve 
Upon my head, long the decrees of Heav'n 
Delay, for longest time to him is short; 
And now too soon for us the circling hours 
This dreaded time have compast, wherein we 
Must bide the stroak of that long threatn'd wound, 
At least if so we can, and by the head 
Broken be not intended all our power 
To be infring'd, our freedom and our being. 
In this fair Empire won of Earth and Air; 
For this ill news I bring, the Womans seed 
Destin'd to this, is late of woman born, 
His birth to our just fear gave no small cause, 
But his growth now to youths full flowr, displaying 
All vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve 
Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. 
Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim 
His coming, is sent Harbinger, who all 
Invites, and in the Consecrated stream 
Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so 
Purified to receive him pure, or rather 
To do him honour as their King; all come, 
And he himself among them was baptiz'd, 
Not thence to be more pure, but to receive 
The testimony of Heaven, that who he is 
Thenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw 
The Prophet do him reverence, on him rising 
Out of the water, Heav'n above the Clouds 
Unfold her Crystal Dores, thence on his head 
A perfect Dove descend, what e're it meant, 
And out of Heav'n the Sov'raign voice I heard, 
This is my Son belov'd, in him am pleas'd. 
His Mother then is mortal, but his Sire, 
He who obtains the Monarchy of Heav'n, 
And what will he not do to advance his Son? 
His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, 
When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep; 
Who this is we must learn, for man he seems 
In all his lineaments, though in his face 
The glimpses of his Fathers glory shine. 
Ye see our danger on the utmost edge 
Of hazard, which admits no long debate, 
But must with something sudden be oppos'd, 
Not force, but well couch't fraud, well woven snares, 
E're in the head of Nations he appear 
Their King, their Leader, and Supream on Earth. 
I, when no other durst, sole undertook 
The dismal expedition to find out 
And ruine Adam, and the exploit perform'd 
Successfully; a calmer voyage now 
Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once 
Induces best to hope of like success. 
   He ended, and his words impression left 
Of much amazement to th' infernal Crew, 
Distracted and surpriz'd with deep dismay 
At these sad tidings; but no time was then 
For long indulgence to their fears or grief: 
Unanimous they all commit the care 
And management of this main enterprize 
To him their great Dictator, whose attempt 
At first against mankind so well had thriv'd 
In Adam's overthrow, and led thir march 
From Hell's deep-vaulted Den to dwell in light, 
Regents and Potentates, and Kings, yea gods 
Of many a pleasant Realm and Province wide. 
So to the Coast of Jordan he directs 
His easie steps; girded with snaky wiles, 
Where he might likeliest find this new-declar'd, 
This man of men, attested Son of God, 
Temptation and all guile on him to try; 
So to subvert whom he suspected rais'd 
To end his Raign on Earth so long enjoy'd: 
But contrary unweeting he fulfill'd 
The purpos'd Counsel pre-ordain'd and fixt 
Of the most High, who in full frequence bright 
Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake. 
   Gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold, 
Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth 
With man or mens affairs, how I begin 
To verifie that solemn message late, 
On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure 
In Galilee, that she should bear a Son 
Great in Renown, and call'd the Son of God; 
Then toldst her doubting how these things could be 
To her a Virgin, that on her should come 
The Holy Ghost, and the power of the highest 
O're-shadow her: this man born and now up-grown, 
To shew him worthy of his birth divine 
And high prediction, henceforth I expose 
To Satan; let him tempt and now assay 
His utmost subtilty, because he boasts 
And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng 
Of his Apostasie; he might have learnt 
Less over-weening, since he fail'd in Job, 
Whose constant perseverance overcame 
Whate're his cruel malice could invent. 
He now shall know I can produce a man 
Of female Seed, far abler to resist 
All his sollicitations, and at length 
All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell, 
Winning by Conquest what the first man lost 
By fallacy surpriz'd.   But first I mean 
To exercise him in the Wilderness, 
There he shall first lay down the rudiments 
Of his great warfare, e're I send him forth 
To conquer Sin and Death the two grand foes, 
By Humiliation and strong Sufferance: 
His weakness shall o'recome Satanic strength 
And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; 
That all the Angels and Ætherial Powers, 
They now, and men hereafter may discern, 
From what consummate vertue I have chose 
This perfect Man, by merit call'd my Son, 
To earn Salvation for the Sons of men. 
   So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven 
Admiring stood a space, then into Hymns 
Burst forth, and in Celestial measures mov'd, 
Circling the Throne and Singing, while the hand 
Sung with the voice, and this the argument. 
   Victory and Triumph to the Son of God 
Now entring his great duel, not of arms, 
But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles. 
The Father knows the Son; therefore secure 
Ventures his filial Vertue, though untri'd, 
Against whate're may tempt, whate're seduce, 
Allure, or terrifie, or undermine. 
Be frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell, 
And devilish machinations come to nought. 
   So they in Heav'n their Odes and Vigils tun'd: 
Mean while the Son of God, who yet some days 
Lodg'd in Bethabara where John baptiz'd, 
Musing and much revolving in his brest, 
How best the mighty work he might begin 
Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first 
Publish his God-like office now mature, 
One day forth walk'd alone, the Spirit leading; 
And his deep thoughts, the better to converse 
With solitude, till far from track of men, 
Thought following thought, and step by step led on, 
He entred now the bordering Desert wild, 
And with dark shades and rocks environ'd round, 
His holy Meditations thus persu'd. 
   O what a multitude of thoughts at once 
Awakn'd in me swarm, while I consider 
What from within I feel my self, and hear 
What from without comes often to my ears, 
Ill sorting with my present state compar'd. 
When I was yet a child, no childish play 
To me was pleasing, all my mind was set 
Serious to learn and know, and thence to do 
What might be publick good; my self I thought 
Born to that end, born to promote all truth, 
All righteous things: therefore above my years, 
The Law of God I read, and found it sweet, 
Made it my whole delight, and in it grew 
To such perfection, that e're yet my age 
Had measur'd twice six years, at our great Feast 
I went into the Temple, there to hear 
The Teachers of our Law, and to propose 
What might improve my knowledge or their own; 
And was admir'd by all, yet this not all 
To which my Spirit aspir'd, victorious deeds 
Flam'd in my heart, heroic acts, one while 
To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke, 
Then to subdue and quell o're all the earth 
Brute violence and proud Tyrannick pow'r, 
Till truth were freed, and equity restor'd: 
Yet held it more humane, more heavenly first 
By winning words to conquer willing hearts, 
And make perswasion do the work of fear; 
At least to try, and teach the erring Soul 
Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware 
Misled; the stubborn only to destroy. 
These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving 
By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd, 
And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts 
O Son, but nourish them and let them soar 
To what highth sacred vertue and true worth 
Can raise them, though above example high; 
By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire. 
For know, thou art no Son of mortal man, 
Though men esteem thee low of Parentage, 
Thy Father is the Eternal King, who rules 
All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men, 
A messenger from God fore-told thy birth 
Conceiv'd in me a Virgin, he fore-told 
Thou shouldst be great and sit on David's Throne, 
And of thy Kingdom there should be no end. 
At thy Nativity a glorious Quire 
Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem sung 
To Shepherds watching at their folds by night, 
And told them the Messiah now was born, 
Where they might see him, and to thee they came; 
Directed to the Manger where thou lais't, 
For in the Inn was left no better room: 
A Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing 
Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, 
To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold, 
By whose bright course led on they found the place, 
Affirming it thy Star new grav'n in Heaven, 
By which they knew thee King of Israel born. 
Just Simeon and Prophetic Anna, warn'd 
By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake 
Before the Altar and the vested Priest, 
Like things of thee to all that present stood. 
This having heard, strait I again revolv'd 
The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ 
Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes 
Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake 
I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie 
Through many a hard assay even to the death, 
E're I the promis'd Kingdom can attain, 
Or work Redemption for mankind, whose sins 
Full weight must be transferr'd upon my head. 
Yet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd, 
The time prefixt I waited, when behold 
The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard, 
Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come 
Before Messiah and his way prepare. 
I as all others to his Baptism came, 
Which I believ'd was from above; but he 
Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd 
Me him (for it was shew'n him so from Heaven) 
Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first 
Refus'd on me his Baptism to confer, 
As much his greater, and was hardly won; 
But as I rose out of the laving stream, 
Heaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence 
The Spirit descended on me like a Dove, 
And last the sum of all, my Father's voice, 
Audibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me his, 
Me his beloved Son, in whom alone 
He was well pleas'd; by which I knew the time 
Now full, that I no more should live obscure, 
But openly begin, as best becomes 
The Authority which I deriv'd from Heaven. 
And now by some strong motion I am led 
Into this Wilderness, to what intent 
I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know; 
For what concerns my knowledge God reveals. 
   So spake our Morning Star then in his rise, 
And looking round on every side beheld 
A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades; 
The way he came not having mark'd, return 
Was difficult, by humane steps untrod; 
And he still on was led, but with such thoughts 
Accompanied of things past and to come 
Lodg'd in his breast, as well might recommend 
Such Solitude before choicest Society. 
Full forty days he pass'd, whether on hill 
Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night 
Under the covert of some ancient Oak, 
Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew, 
Or harbour'd in one Cave, is not reveal'd; 
Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt 
Till those days ended, hunger'd then at last 
Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild, 
Nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk 
The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, 
The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof. 
But now an aged man in Rural weeds, 
Following, as seem'd, the quest of some stray Ewe, 
Or wither'd sticks to gather; which might serve 
Against a Winters day when winds blow keen, 
To warm him wet return'd from field at Eve, 
He saw approach, who first with curious eye 
Perus'd him, then with words thus utt'red spake. 
   Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place 
So far from path or road of men, who pass 
In Troop or Caravan, for single none 
Durst ever, who return'd, and dropt not here 
His Carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth? 
I ask the rather, and the more admire, 
For that to me thou seem'st the man, whom late 
Our new baptizing Prophet at the Ford 
Of Jordan honour'd so, and call'd thee Son 
Of God; I saw and heard, for we sometimes 
Who dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come forth 
To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far) 
Where ought we hear, and curious are to hear, 
What happ'ns new; Fame also finds us out. 
   To whom the Son of God. Who brought me hither 
Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek. 
   By Miracle he may, reply'd the Swain, 
What other way I see not, for we here 
Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd 
More then the Camel, and to drink go far, 
Men to much misery and hardship born; 
But if thou be the Son of God, Command 
That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; 
So shalt thou save thy self and us relieve 
With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste. 
   He ended, and the Son of God reply'd. 
Think'st thou such force in Bread? is it not written 
(For I discern thee other then thou seem'st) 
Man lives not by Bread only, but each Word 
Proceeding from the mouth of God; who fed 
Our Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount 
Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank, 
And forty days Eliah without food 
Wandred this barren waste, the same I now. 
Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust, 
Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art? 
   Whom thus answer'd th' Arch Fiend now undisguis'd. 
'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate, 
Who leagu'd with millions more in rash revolt 
Kept not my happy Station, but was driv'n 
With them from bliss to the bottomless deep, 
Yet to that hideous place not so confin'd 
By rigour unconniving, but that oft 
Leaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy 
Large liberty to round this Globe of Earth, 
Or range in th' Air, nor from the Heav'n of Heav'ns 
Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. 
I came among the Sons of God, when he 
Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job 
To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; 
And when to all his Angels he propos'd 
To draw the proud King Ahab into fraud 
That he might fall in Ramoth, they demuring, 
I undertook that office, and the tongues 
Of all his flattering Prophets glibb'd with lyes 
To his destruction, as I had in charge. 
For what he bids I do; though I have lost 
Much lustre of my native brightness, lost 
To be belov'd of God, I have not lost 
To love, at least contemplate and admire 
What I see excellent in good, or fair, 
Or vertuous, I should so have lost all sense. 
What can be then less in me then desire 
To see thee and approach thee, whom I know 
Declar'd the Son of God, to hear attent 
Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds? 
Men generally think me much a foe 
To all mankind: why should I? they to me 
Never did wrong or violence, by them 
I lost not what I lost, rather by them 
I gain'd what I have gain'd, and with them dwell 
Copartner in these Regions of the World, 
If not disposer; lend them oft my aid, 
Oft my advice by presages and signs, 
And answers, oracles, portents and dreams, 
Whereby they may direct their future life. 
Envy they say excites me, thus to gain 
Companions of my misery and wo. 
At first it may be; but long since with wo 
Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof, 
That fellowship in pain divides not smart, 
Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load. 
Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn'd: 
This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man, 
Man fall'n shall be restor'd, I never more. 
   To whom our Saviour sternly thus reply'd. 
Deservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of lyes 
From the beginning, and in lies wilt end; 
Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come 
Into the Heav'n of Heavens; thou com'st indeed, 
As a poor miserable captive thrall, 
Comes to the place where he before had sat 
Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos'd, 
Ejected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, shun'd, 
A spectacle of ruin or of scorn 
To all the Host of Heaven; the happy place 
Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy, 
Rather inflames thy torment, representing 
Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable, 
So never more in Hell then when in Heaven. 
But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King. 
Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear 
Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? 
What but thy malice mov'd thee to misdeem 
Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him 
With all inflictions, but his patience won? 
The other service was thy chosen task, 
To be a lyer in four hundred mouths; 
For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. 
Yet thou pretend'st to truth; all Oracles 
By thee are giv'n, and what confest more true 
Among the Nations? that hath been thy craft, 
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes. 
But what have been thy answers, what but dark 
Ambiguous and with double sense deluding, 
Which they who ask'd have seldom understood, 
And not well understood as good not known? 
Who ever by consulting at thy shrine 
Return'd the wiser, or the more instruct 
To flye or follow what concern'd him most, 
And run not sooner to his fatal snare? 
For God hath justly giv'n the Nations up 
To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell 
Idolatrous, but when his purpose is 
Among them to declare his Providence 
To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, 
But from him or his Angels President 
In every Province, who themselves disdaining 
To approach thy Temples, give thee in command 
What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say 
To thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear, 
Or like a Fawning Parasite obey'st; 
Then to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told. 
But this thy glory shall be soon retrench'd; 
No more shalt thou by oracling abuse 
The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast, 
And thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice 
Shalt be enquir'd at Delphos or elsewhere, 
At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. 
God hath now sent his living Oracle 
Into the World, to teach his final will, 
And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell 
In pious Hearts, an inward Oracle 
To all truth requisite for men to know. 
   So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, 
Though inly stung with anger and disdain, 
Dissembl'd, and this Answer smooth return'd. 
   Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, 
And urg'd me hard with doings, which not will 
But misery hath rested from me; where 
Easily canst thou find one miserable, 
And not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth; 
If it may stand him more in stead to lye, 
Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? 
But thou art plac't above me, thou art Lord; 
From thee I can and must submiss endure 
Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. 
Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, 
Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear, 
And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song; 
What wonder then if I delight to hear 
Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire 
Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me 
To hear thee when I come (since no man comes) 
And talk at least, though I despair to attain. 
Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure, 
Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest 
To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister 
About his Altar, handling holy things, 
Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice 
To Balaam Reprobate, a Prophet yet 
Inspir'd; disdain not such access to me. 
   To whom our Saviour with unalter'd brow. 
Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, 
I bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st 
Permission from above; thou canst not more. 
   He added not; and Satan bowing low 
His gray dissimulation, disappear'd 
Into thin Air diffus'd: for now began 
Night with her sullen wing to double-shade 
The Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were couch't; 
And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45749/paradise-regaind-book-1-1671-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Regain'd: Book 2 (1671 version),"MEan while the new-baptiz'd, who yet remain'd 
At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen 
Him whom they heard so late expresly call'd 
Jesus Messiah Son of God declar'd, 
And on that high Authority had believ'd, 
And with him talkt, and with him lodg'd, I mean 
Andrew and Simon, famous after known 
With others though in Holy Writ not nam'd, 
Now missing him thir joy so lately found, 
So lately found, and so abruptly gone, 
Began to doubt, and doubted many days, 
And as the days increas'd, increas'd thir doubt: 
Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, 
And for a time caught up to God, as once 
Moses was in the Mount, and missing long; 
And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels 
Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. 
Therefore as those young Prophets then with care 
Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these 
Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico 
The City of Palms, Ænon, and Salem Old, 
Machærus and each Town or City wall'd 
On this side the broad lake Genezaret, 
Or in Perea, but return'd in vain. 
Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: 
Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play 
Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, 
Close in a Cottage low together got 
Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd. 
Alas, from what high hope to what relapse 
Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld 
Messiah certainly now come, so long 
Expected of our Fathers; we have heard 
His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, 
Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, 
The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor'd: 
Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd 
Into perplexity and new amaze: 
For whither is he gone, what accident 
Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire 
After appearance, and again prolong 
Our expectation?   God of Israel, 
Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; 
Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress 
Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust 
They have exalted, and behind them cast 
All fear of thee, arise and vindicate 
Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, 
But let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, 
Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him, 
By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, 
In publick, and with him we have convers'd; 
Let us be glad of this, and all our fears 
Lay on his Providence; he will not fail 
Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, 
Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, 
Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. 
   Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume 
To find whom at the first they found unsought: 
But to his Mother Mary, when she saw 
Others return'd from Baptism, not her Son, 
Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; 
Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, 
Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd 
Some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. 
   O what avails me now that honour high 
To have conceiv'd of God, or that salute 
Hale highly favour'd, among women blest; 
While I to sorrows am no less advanc't, 
And fears as eminent, above the lot 
Of other women, by the birth I bore, 
In such a season born when scarce a Shed 
Could be obtain'd to shelter him or me 
From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, 
A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye 
Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous King 
Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd 
With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; 
From Egypt home return'd, in Nazareth 
Hath been our dwelling many years, his life 
Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, 
Little suspicious to any King; but now 
Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear, 
By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, 
Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice; 
I look't for some great change; to Honour? no, 
But trouble, as old Simeon plain fore-told, 
That to the fall and rising he should be 
Of many in Israel, and to a sign 
Spoken against, that through my very Soul 
A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, 
My Exaltation to Afflictions high; 
Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; 
I will not argue that, nor will repine. 
But where delays he now? some great intent 
Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, 
I lost him, but so found, as well I saw 
He could not lose himself; but went about 
His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, 
Since understand; much more his absence now 
Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. 
But I to wait with patience am inur'd; 
My heart hath been a store-house long of things 
And sayings laid up, portending strange events. 
   Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind 
Recalling what remarkably had pass'd 
Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts 
Meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: 
The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, 
Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, 
Into himself descended, and at once 
All his great work to come before him set; 
How to begin, how to accomplish best 
His end of being on Earth, and mission high: 
For Satan with slye preface to return 
Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon 
Up to the middle Region of thick Air, 
Where all his Potentates in Council sate; 
There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, 
Sollicitous and blank he thus began. 
   Princes, Heavens antient Sons, Æthereal Thrones, 
Demonian Spirits now, from the Element 
Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, 
Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, 
So may we hold our place and these mild seats 
Without new trouble; such an Enemy 
Is ris'n to invade us, who no less 
Threat'ns then our expulsion down to Hell; 
I, as I undertook, and with the vote 
Consenting in full frequence was impowr'd, 
Have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find 
Far other labour to be undergon 
Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, 
Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, 
However to this Man inferior far, 
If he be Man by Mothers side at least, 
With more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn'd, 
Perfections absolute, Graces divine, 
And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. 
Therefore I am return'd, lest confidence 
Of my success with Eve in Paradise 
Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure 
Of like succeeding here; I summon all 
Rather to be in readiness, with hand 
Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst 
Thought none my equal, now be over-match'd. 
   So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all 
With clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid 
At his command; when from amidst them rose 
Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell, 
The sensuallest, and after Asmodai 
The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis'd. 
   Set women in his eye and in his walk, 
Among daughters of men the fairest found; 
Many are in each Region passing fair 
As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses 
Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, 
Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues 
Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild 
And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, 
Skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw 
Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets. 
Such object hath the power to soft'n and tame 
Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, 
Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, 
Draw out with credulous desire, and lead 
At will the manliest, resolutest brest, 
As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. 
Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart 
Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, 
And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives. 
   To whom quick answer Satan thus return'd. 
Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st 
All others by thy self; because of old 
Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring 
Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, 
None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. 
Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, 
False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth 
Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, 
And coupl'd with them, and begot a race. 
Have we not seen, or by relation heard, 
In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st, 
In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, 
In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay 
Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, 
Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, 
Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more 
Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, 
Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, 
Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan?   But these haunts 
Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, 
How many have with a smile made small account 
Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd 
All her assaults, on worthier things intent? 
Remember that Pellean Conquerour, 
A youth, how all the Beauties of the East 
He slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; 
How hee sirnam'd of Africa dismiss'd 
In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. 
For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and full 
Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond 
Higher design then to enjoy his State; 
Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd; 
But he whom we attempt is wiser far 
Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, 
Made and set wholly on the accomplishment 
Of greatest things; what woman will you find, 
Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, 
On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye 
Of fond desire? or should she confident, 
As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne, 
Descend with all her winning charms begirt 
To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once 
Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; 
How would one look from his Majestick brow 
Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, 
Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout 
All her array; her female pride deject, 
Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands 
In the admiration only of weak minds 
Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes 
Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, 
At every sudden slighting quite abasht: 
Therefore with manlier objects we must try 
His constancy, with such as have more shew 
Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; 
Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; 
Or that which only seems to satisfie 
Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; 
And now I know he hungers where no food 
Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; 
The rest commit to me, I shall let pass 
No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. 
   He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; 
Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band 
Of Spirits likest to himself in guile 
To be at hand, and at his beck appear, 
If cause were to unfold some active Scene 
Of various persons each to know his part; 
Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; 
Where still from shade to shade the Son of God 
After forty days fasting had remain'd, 
Now hungring first, and to himself thus said. 
   Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd 
Wandring this woody maze, and humane food 
Nor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast 
To Vertue I impute not, or count part 
Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, 
Or God support Nature without repast 
Though needing, what praise is it to endure? 
But now I feel I hunger, which declares, 
Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God 
Can satisfie that need some other way, 
Though hunger still remain: so it remain 
Without this bodies wasting, I content me, 
And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, 
Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed 
Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will. 
   It was the hour of night, when thus the Son 
Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down 
Under the hospitable covert nigh 
Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, 
And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, 
Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; 
Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood 
And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks 
Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, 
Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: 
He saw the Prophet also how he fled 
Into the Desert, and how there he slept 
Under a Juniper; then how awakt, 
He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, 
And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, 
And eat the second time after repose, 
The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; 
Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, 
Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. 
Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark 
Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry 
The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: 
As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose 
Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, 
Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. 
Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, 
From whose high top to ken the prospect round, 
If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; 
But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, 
Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, 
With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; 
Thither he bent his way, determin'd there 
To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade 
High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown 
That open'd in the midst a woody Scene, 
Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art) 
And to a Superstitious eye the haunt 
Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round, 
When suddenly a man before him stood, 
Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, 
As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, 
And with fair speech these words to him address'd. 
   With granted leave officious I return, 
But much more wonder that the Son of God 
In this wild solitude so long should bide 
Of all things destitute, and well I know, 
Not without hunger.   Others of some note, 
As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; 
The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son 
Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief 
By a providing Angel; all the race 
Of Israel here had famish'd, had not God 
Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold 
Native of Thebes wandring here was fed 
Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. 
Of thee these forty days none hath regard, 
Forty and more deserted here indeed. 
   To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? 
They all had need, I as thou seest have none. 
   How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd, 
Tell me if Food were now before thee set, 
Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like 
The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that 
Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, 
Hast thou not right to all Created things, 
Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee 
Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, 
But tender all their power? nor mention I 
Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first 
To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; 
Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who 
Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold 
Nature asham'd, or better to express, 
Troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd 
From all the Elements her choicest store 
To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord 
With honour, only deign to sit and eat. 
   He spake no dream, for as his words had end, 
Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld 
In ample space under the broadest shade 
A Table richly spred, in regal mode, 
With dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort 
And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, 
In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, 
Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, 
Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, 
And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd 
Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. 
Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd, 
Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! 
And at a stately side-board by the wine 
That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood 
Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew 
Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more 
Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood 
Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades 
With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, 
And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem'd 
Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since 
Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide 
By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, 
Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, 
And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard 
Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds 
Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd 
From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. 
Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now 
His invitation earnestly renew'd. 
   What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? 
These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict 
Defends the touching of these viands pure, 
Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, 
But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, 
Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. 
All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, 
Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay 
Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: 
What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat. 
   To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd: 
Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? 
And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? 
Shall I receive by gift what of my own, 
When and where likes me best, I can command? 
I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, 
Command a Table in this Wilderness, 
And call swift flights of Angels ministrant 
Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend: 
Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, 
In vain, where no acceptance it can find, 
And with my hunger what has thou to do? 
Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, 
And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. 
   To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: 
That I have also power to give thou seest, 
If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary 
What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd, 
And rather opportunely in this place 
Chose to impart to thy apparent need, 
Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see 
What I can do or offer is suspect; 
Of these things others quickly will dispose 
Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With that 
Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite 
With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; 
Only the importune Tempter still remain'd, 
And with these words his temptation pursu'd. 
   By hunger, that each other Creature tames, 
Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; 
Thy temperance invincible besides, 
For no allurement yields to appetite, 
And all thy heart is set on high designs, 
High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? 
Great acts require great means of enterprise, 
Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, 
A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self 
Bred up in poverty and streights at home; 
Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: 
Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire 
To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, 
What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, 
Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, 
Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? 
Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; 
What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, 
And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's Throne; 
(Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? 
Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, 
Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, 
Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, 
Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; 
They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, 
While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want. 
   To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd; 
Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, 
To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. 
Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, 
In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: 
But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd 
In lowest poverty to highest deeds; 
Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, 
Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat 
So many Ages, and shall yet regain 
That seat, and reign in Israel without end. 
Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World 
To me is not unknown what hath been done 
Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember 
Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? 
For I esteem those names of men so poor 
Who could do mighty things, and could contemn 
Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings. 
And what in me seems wanting, but that I 
May also in this poverty as soon 
Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? 
Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools, 
The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt 
To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, 
Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. 
What if with like aversion I reject 
Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, 
Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, 
Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights 
To him who wears the Regal Diadem, 
When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; 
For therein stands the office of a King, 
His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, 
That for the Publick all this weight he bears. 
Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules 
Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; 
Which every wise and vertuous man attains: 
And who attains not, ill aspires to rule 
Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes, 
Subject himself to Anarchy within, 
Or lawless passions in him which he serves. 
But to guide Nations in the way of truth 
By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead 
To know, and knowing worship God aright, 
Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, 
Governs the inner man, the nobler part, 
That other o're the body only reigns, 
And oft by force, which to a generous mind 
So reigning can be no sincere delight. 
Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought 
Greater and nobler done, and to lay down 
Far more magnanimous, then to assume. 
Riches are needless then, both for themselves, 
And for thy reason why they should be sought, 
To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45750/paradise-regaind-book-2-1671-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Regain'd: Book 3 (1671 version),"SO spake the Son of God, and Satan stood 
A while as mute confounded what to say, 
What to reply, confuted and convinc't 
Of his weak arguing, and fallacious drift; 
At length collecting all his Serpent wiles, 
With soothing words renew'd, him thus accosts. 
   I see thou know'st what is of use to know, 
What best to say canst say, to do canst do; 
Thy actions to thy words accord, thy words 
To thy large heart give utterance due, thy heart 
Conteins of good, wise, just, the perfect shape. 
Should Kings and Nations from thy mouth consult, 
Thy Counsel would be as the Oracle 
Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems 
On Aaron's breast: or tongue of Seers old 
Infallible; or wert thou sought to deeds 
That might require th' array of war, thy skill 
Of conduct would be such, that all the world 
Could not sustain thy Prowess, or subsist 
In battel, though against thy few in arms. 
These God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou hide? 
Affecting private life, or more obscure 
In savage Wilderness, wherefore deprive 
All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy self 
The fame and glory, glory the reward 
That sole excites to high attempts the flame 
Of most erected Spirits, most temper'd pure 
Ætherial, who all pleasures else despise, 
All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, 
And dignities and powers all but the highest? 
Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the Son 
Of Macedonian Philip had e're these 
Won Asia and the Throne of Cyrus held 
At his dispose, young Scipio had brought down 
The Carthaginian pride, young Pompey quell'd 
The Pontic King and in triumph had rode. 
Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, 
Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. 
Great Julius, whom now all the world admires 
The more he grew in years, the more inflam'd 
With glory, wept that he had liv'd so long 
Inglorious: but thou yet art not too late. 
   To whom our Saviour calmly thus reply'd. 
Thou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth 
For Empires sake, nor Empire to affect 
For glories sake by all thy argument. 
For what is glory but the blaze of fame, 
The peoples praise, if always praise unmixt? 
And what the people but a herd confus'd, 
A miscellaneous rabble, who extol 
Things vulgar, & well weigh'd, scarce worth the praise, 
They praise and they admire they know not what; 
And know not whom, but as one leads the other; 
And what delight to be by such extoll'd, 
To live upon thir tongues and be thir talk, 
Of whom to be disprais'd were no small praise? 
His lot who dares be singularly good. 
Th' intelligent among them and the wise 
Are few, and glory scarce of few is rais'd. 
This is true glory and renown, when God 
Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks 
The just man, and divulges him through Heaven 
To all his Angels, who with true applause 
Recount his praises; thus he did to Job, 
When to extend his fame through Heaven & Earth, 
As thou to thy reproach mayst well remember, 
He ask'd thee, hast thou seen my servant Job? 
Famous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known; 
Where glory is false glory, attributed 
To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. 
They err who count it glorious to subdue 
By Conquest far and wide, to over-run 
Large Countries, and in field great Battels win, 
Great Cities by assault: what do these Worthies, 
But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave 
Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote, 
Made Captive, yet deserving freedom more 
Then those thir Conquerours, who leave behind 
Nothing but ruin wheresoe're they rove, 
And all the flourishing works of peace destroy, 
Then swell with pride, and must be titl'd Gods, 
Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, 
Worship't with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice; 
One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the other, 
Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce men, 
Rowling in brutish vices, and deform'd, 
Violent or shameful death thir due reward. 
But if there be in glory aught of good, 
It may by means far different be attain'd 
Without ambition, war, or violence; 
By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, 
By patience, temperance; I mention still 
Him whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience born, 
Made famous in a Land and times obscure; 
Who names not now with honour patient Job? 
Poor Socrates (who next more memorable?) 
By what he taught and suffer'd for so doing, 
For truths sake suffering death unjust, lives now 
Equal in fame to proudest Conquerours. 
Yet if for fame and glory aught be done, 
Aught suffer'd; if young African for fame 
His wasted Country freed from Punic rage, 
The deed becomes unprais'd, the man at least, 
And loses, though but verbal, his reward. 
Shall I seek glory then, as vain men seek 
Oft not deserv'd?   I seek not mine, but his 
Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am. 
   To whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply'd. 
Think not so slight of glory; therein least 
Resembling thy great Father: he seeks glory, 
And for his glory all things made, all things 
Orders and governs, nor content in Heaven 
By all his Angels glorifi'd, requires 
Glory from men, from all men good or bad, 
Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption; 
Above all Sacrifice, or hallow'd gift 
Glory he requires, and glory he receives 
Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or Greek, 
Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declar'd; 
From us his foes pronounc't glory he exacts. 
   To whom our Saviour fervently reply'd. 
And reason; since his word all things produc'd, 
Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, 
But to shew forth his goodness, and impart 
His good communicable to every soul 
Freely; of whom what could he less expect 
Then glory and benediction, that is thanks, 
The slightest, easiest, readiest recompence 
From them who could return him nothing else, 
And not returning that would likeliest render 
Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? 
Hard recompence, unsutable return 
For so much good, so much beneficence. 
But why should man seek glory? who of his own 
Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs 
But condemnation, ignominy, and shame? 
Who for so many benefits receiv'd 
Turn'd recreant to God, ingrate and false, 
And so of all true good himself despoil'd, 
Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take 
That which to God alone of right belongs; 
Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, 
That who advance his glory, not thir own, 
Them he himself to glory will advance. 
   So spake the Son of God; and here again 
Satan had not to answer, but stood struck 
With guilt of his own sin, for he himself 
Insatiable of glory had lost all, 
Yet of another Plea bethought him soon. 
   Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so deem, 
Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass: 
But to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain'd 
To sit upon thy Father David's Throne; 
By Mothers side thy Father, though thy right 
Be now in powerful hands, that will not part 
Easily from possession won with arms; 
Judæa now and all the promis'd land 
Reduc't a Province under Roman yoke, 
Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul'd 
With temperate sway; oft have they violated 
The Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts, 
Abominations rather, as did once 
Antiochus: and think'st thou to regain 
Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring? 
So did not Machabeus: he indeed 
Retir'd unto the Desert, but with arms; 
And o're a mighty King so oft prevail'd, 
That by strong hand his Family obtain'd, 
Though Priests, the Crown, and David's Throne usurp'd, 
With Modin and her Suburbs once content. 
If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal, 
And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow; 
But on Occasions forelock watchful wait. 
They themselves rather are occasion best, 
Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free 
Thy Country from her Heathen servitude; 
So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie 
The Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign, 
The happier raign the sooner it begins, 
Raign then; what canst thou better do the while? 
   To whom our Saviour answer thus return'd. 
All things are best fullfil'd in their due time, 
And time there is for all things, Truth hath said: 
If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told, 
That it shall never end, so when begin 
The Father in his purpose hath decreed, 
He in whose hand all times and seasons roul. 
What if he hath decreed that I shall first 
Be try'd in humble state, and things adverse, 
By tribulations, injuries, insults, 
Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, 
Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting 
Without distrust or doubt, that he may know 
What I can suffer, how obey? who best 
Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who first 
Well hath obey'd; just tryal e're I merit 
My exaltation without change or end. 
But what concerns it thee when I begin 
My everlasting Kingdom, why art thou 
Sollicitous, what moves thy inquisition? 
Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall, 
And my promotion will be thy destruction? 
   To whom the Tempter inly rackt reply'd. 
Let that come when it comes; all hope is lost 
Of my reception into grace; what worse? 
For where no hope is left, is left no fear; 
If there be worse, the expectation more 
Of worse torments me then the feeling can. 
I would be at the worst; worst is my Port, 
My harbour and my ultimate repose, 
The end I would attain, my final good. 
My error was my error and my crime 
My crime; whatever for it self condemn'd, 
And will alike be punish'd; whether thou 
Raign or raign not; though to that gentle brow 
Willingly I could flye, and hope thy raign, 
From that placid aspect and meek regard, 
Rather then aggravate my evil state, 
Would stand between me and thy Fathers ire, 
(Whose ire I dread more then the fire of Hell) 
A shelter and a kind of shading cool 
Interposition, as a summers cloud. 
If I then to the worst that can be hast, 
Why move thy feet so slow to what is best, 
Happiest both to thy self and all the world, 
That thou who worthiest art should'st be thir King? 
Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detain'd 
Of the enterprize so hazardous and high; 
No wonder, for though in thee be united 
What of perfection can in man be found, 
Or human nature can receive, consider 
Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent 
At home, scarce view'd the Gallilean Towns, 
And once a year Jerusalem, few days 
Short sojourn; and what thence could'st thou observe? 
The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, 
Empires, and Monarchs, and thir radiant Courts, 
Best school of best experience, quickest in sight 
In all things that to greatest actions lead. 
The wisest, unexperienc't, will be ever 
Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, 
(As he who seeking Asses found a Kingdom) 
Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: 
But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit 
Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes 
The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and state, 
Sufficient introduction to inform 
Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal Arts, 
And regal Mysteries; that thou may'st know 
How best their opposition to withstand. 
   With that (such power was giv'n him then) he took 
The Son of God up to a Mountain high. 
It was a Mountain at whose verdant feet 
A spatious plain out stretch't in circuit wide 
Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flow'd, 
Th' one winding, the other strait and left between 
Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, 
Then meeting joyn'd thir tribute to the Sea: 
Fertil of corn the glebe, of oyl and wine, 
With herds the pastures throng'd, with flocks the hills, 
Huge Cities and high towr'd, that well might seem 
The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so large 
The Prospect was, that here and there was room 
For barren desert fountainless and dry. 
To this high mountain top the Tempter brought 
Our Saviour, and new train of words began. 
   Well have we speeded, and o're hill and dale, 
Forest and field, and flood, Temples and Towers 
Cut shorter many a league; here thou behold'st 
Assyria and her Empires antient bounds, 
Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence on 
As far as Indus East, Euphrates West, 
And oft beyond; to South the Persian Bay, 
And inaccessible the Arabian drouth: 
Here Ninevee, of length within her wall 
Several days journey, built by Ninus old, 
Of that first golden Monarchy the seat, 
And seat of Salmanassar, whose success 
Israel in long captivity still mourns; 
There Babylon the wonder of all tongues, 
As antient, but rebuilt by him who twice 
Judah and all thy Father David's house 
Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, 
Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis 
His City there thou seest, and Bactra there; 
Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, 
And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates, 
There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, 
The drink of none but Kings; of later fame 
Built by Emathian, or by Parthian hands, 
The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there 
Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, 
Turning with easie eye thou may'st behold. 
All these the Parthian, now some Ages past, 
By great Arsaces led, who founded first 
That Empire, under his dominion holds 
From the luxurious Kings of Antioch won. 
And just in time thou com'st to have a view 
Of his great power; for now the Parthian King 
In Ctesiphon hath gather'd all his Host 
Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild 
Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid 
He marches now in hast; see, though from far, 
His thousands, in what martial equipage 
They issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms 
Of equal dread in flight, or in pursuit; 
All Horsemen, in which fight they most excel; 
See how in warlike muster they appear, 
In Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings. 
   He look't and saw what numbers numberless 
The City gates out powr'd, light armed Troops 
In coats of Mail and military pride; 
In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong, 
Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice 
Of many Provinces from bound to bound; 
From Arachosia, from Candaor East, 
And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs 
Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales, 
From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains 
Of Adiabene, Media, and the South 
Of Susiana to Balsara's hav'n. 
He saw them in thir forms of battell rang'd, 
How quick they wheel'd, and flying behind them shot 
Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face 
Of thir pursuers, and overcame by flight; 
The field all iron cast a gleaming brown, 
Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn, 
Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight; 
Chariots or Elephants endorst with Towers 
Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners 
A multitude with Spades and Axes arm'd 
To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, 
Or where plain was raise hill, or over-lay 
With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke; 
Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, 
And Waggons fraught with Utensils of war. 
Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, 
When Agrican with all his Northern powers 
Besieg'd Albracca, as Romances tell; 
The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win 
The fairest of her Sex Angelica 
His daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights, 
Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. 
Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; 
At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum'd, 
And to our Saviour thus his words renew'd. 
   That thou may'st know I seek not to engage 
Thy Vertue, and not every way secure 
On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark 
To what end I have brought thee hither and shewn 
All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold 
By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou 
Endeavour, as thy Father David did, 
Thou never shalt obtain; prediction still 
In all things, and all men, supposes means, 
Without means us'd, what it predicts revokes. 
But say thou wer't possess'd of David's Throne 
By free consent of all, none opposite, 
Samaritan or Jew; how could'st thou hope 
Long to enjoy it quiet and secure, 
Between two such enclosing enemies 
Roman and Parthian? therefore one of these 
Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian first 
By my advice, as nearer and of late 
Found able by invasion to annoy 
Thy country, and captive lead away her Kings 
Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus bound, 
Maugre the Roman: it shall be my task 
To render thee the Parthian at dispose; 
Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league. 
By him thou shalt regain, without him not, 
That which alone can truly reinstall thee 
In David's royal seat, his true Successour, 
Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes 
Whose off-spring in his Territory yet serve 
In Habor, and among the Medes dispers't, 
Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph lost 
Thus long from Israel; serving as of old 
Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt serv'd, 
This offer sets before thee to deliver. 
These if from servitude thou shalt restore 
To thir inheritance, then, nor till then, 
Thou on the Throne of David in full glory, 
From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond 
Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear. 
   To whom our Saviour answer'd thus unmov'd. 
Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm, 
And fragile arms, much instrument of war 
Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, 
Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear 
Vented much policy, and projects deep 
Of enemies, of aids, battels and leagues, 
Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. 
Means I must use thou say'st, prediction else 
Will unpredict and fail me of the Throne: 
My time I told thee, (and that time for thee 
Were better farthest off) is not yet come,; 
When that comes think not thou to find me slack 
On my part aught endeavouring, or to need 
Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome 
Luggage of war there shewn me, argument 
Of human weakness rather then of strength. 
My brethren, as thou call'st them; those Ten Tribes 
I must deliver, if I mean to raign 
David's true heir, and his full Scepter sway 
To just extent over all Israel's Sons; 
But whence to thee this zeal, where was it then 
For Israel, or for David, or his Throne, 
When thou stood'st up his Tempter to the pride 
Of numbring Israel, which cost the lives 
Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites 
By three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal 
To Israel then, the same that now to me. 
As for those captive Tribes, themselves were they 
Who wrought their own captivity, fell off 
From God to worship Calves, the Deities 
Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, 
And all the Idolatries of Heathen round, 
Besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes; 
Nor in the land of their captivity 
Humbled themselves, or penitent besought 
The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy'd 
Impenitent, and left a race behind 
Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce 
From Gentils, but by Circumcision vain, 
And God with Idols in their worship joyn'd. 
Should I of these the liberty regard, 
Who freed, as to their antient Patrimony, 
Unhumbl'd, unrepentant, unreform'd, 
Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps 
Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them serve 
Thir enemies, who serve Idols with God. 
Yet he at length, time to himself best known, 
Remembring Abraham by some wond'rous call 
May bring them back repentant and sincere, 
And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, 
While to their native land with joy they hast, 
As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, 
When to the promis'd land thir Fathers pass'd; 
To his due time and providence I leave them. 
   So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend 
Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. 
So fares it when with truth falshood contends.",blank verse,meters,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'God & the Divine', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45751/paradise-regaind-book-3-1671-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-milton,,1608.0,1674.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Milton,1608–1674,Paradise Regain'd: Book 4 (1671 version),"PErplex'd and troubl'd at his bad success 
The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, 
Discover'd in his fraud, thrown from his hope, 
So oft, and the perswasive Rhetoric 
That sleek't his tongue, and won so much on Eve, 
So little here, nay lost; but Eve was Eve, 
This far his over-match, who self deceiv'd 
And rash, before-hand had no better weigh'd 
The strength he was to cope with, or his own: 
But as a man who had been matchless held 
In cunning, over-reach't where least he thought, 
To salve his credit, and for very spight 
Still will be tempting him who foyls him still, 
And never cease, though to his shame the more; 
Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time, 
About the wine-press where sweet moust is powr'd, 
Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; 
Or surging waves against a solid rock, 
Though all to shivers dash't, the assault renew, 
Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles end; 
So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse 
Met ever; and to shameful silence brought, 
Yet gives not o're though desperate of success, 
And his vain importunity pursues. 
He brought our Saviour to the western side 
Of that high mountain, whence he might behold 
Another plain, long but in bredth not wide; 
Wash'd by the Southern Sea, and on the North 
To equal length back'd with a ridge of hills 
That screen'd the fruits of the earth and seats of men 
From cold Septentrion blasts, thence in the midst 
Divided by a river, of whose banks 
On each side an Imperial City stood, 
With Towers and Temples proudly elevate 
On seven small Hills, with Palaces adorn'd, 
Porches and Theatres, Baths, Aqueducts, 
Statues and Trophees, and Triumphal Arcs, 
Gardens and Groves presented to his eyes, 
Above the highth of Mountains interpos'd. 
By what strange Parallax or Optic skill 
Of vision multiplyed through air, or glass 
Of Telescope, were curious to enquire: 
And now the Tempter thus his silence broke. 
   The City which thou seest no other deem 
Then great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth 
So far renown'd, and with the spoils enricht 
Of Nations; there the Capitol thou seest 
Above the rest lifting his stately head 
On the Tarpeian rock, her Cittadel 
Impregnable, and there Mount Palatine 
The Imperial Palace, compass huge, and high 
The Structure, skill of noblest Architects, 
With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, 
Turrets and Terrases, and glittering Spires. 
Many a fair Edifice besides, more like 
Houses of Gods (so well I have dispos'd 
My Aerie Microscope) thou may'st behold 
Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs 
Carv'd work, the hand of fam'd Artificers 
In Cedar, Marble, Ivory or Gold. 
Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see 
What conflux issuing forth, or entring in, 
Pretors, Proconsuls to thir Provinces 
Hasting or on return, in robes of State; 
Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir power, 
Legions and Cohorts, turmes of horse and wings: 
Or Embassies from Regions far remote 
In various habits on the Appian road, 
Or on the Æmilian, some from farthest South, 
Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, 
Meroe Nilotic Isle, and more to West, 
The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor Sea; 
From the Asian Kings and Parthian among these, 
From India and the golden Chersoness, 
And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane, 
Dusk faces with white silken Turbants wreath'd: 
From Gallia, Gades, and the Brittish West, 
Germans and Scythians, and Sarmatians North 
Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool. 
All Nations now to Rome obedience pay, 
To Rome's great Emperour, whose wide domain 
In ample Territory, wealth and power, 
Civility of Manners, Arts, and Arms, 
And long Renown thou justly may'st prefer 
Before the Parthian; these two Thrones except, 
The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, 
Shar'd among petty Kings too far remov'd; 
These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all 
The Kingdoms of the world, and all thir glory. 
This Emperour hath no Son, and now is old, 
Old, and lascivious, and from Rome retir'd 
To Capreæ an Island small but strong 
On the Campanian shore, with purpose there 
His horrid lusts in private to enjoy, 
Committing to a wicked Favourite 
All publick cares, and yet of him suspicious, 
Hated of all, and hating; with what ease 
Indu'd with Regal Vertues as thou art, 
Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, 
Might'st thou expel this monster from his Throne 
Now made a stye, and in his place ascending 
A victor, people free from servile yoke? 
And with my help thou may'st; to me the power 
Is given, and by that right I give it thee. 
Aim therefore at no less then all the world, 
Aim at the highest, without the highest attain'd 
Will be for thee no sitting, or not long 
On David's Throne, be propheci'd what will. 
   To whom the Son of God unmov'd reply'd. 
Nor doth this grandeur and majestic show 
Of luxury, though call'd magnificence, 
More then of arms before, allure mine eye, 
Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell 
Thir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts 
On Cittron tables or Atlantic stone; 
(For I have also heard, perhaps have read) 
Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, 
Chios and Creet, and how they quaff in Gold, 
Crystal and Myrrhine cups imboss'd with Gems 
And studs of Pearl, to me should'st tell who thirst 
And hunger still: then Embassies thou shew'st 
From Nations far and nigh; what honour that, 
But tedious wast of time to sit and hear 
So many hollow complements and lies, 
Outlandish flatteries? then proceed'st to talk 
Of the Emperour, how easily subdu'd, 
How gloriously; I shall, thou say'st, expel 
A brutish monster: what if I withal 
Expel a Devil who first made him such? 
Let his tormenter Conscience find him out, 
For him I was not sent, nor yet to free 
That people victor once, now vile and base, 
Deservedly made vassal, who once just, 
Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer'd well, 
But govern ill the Nations under yoke, 
Peeling thir Provinces, exhausted all 
By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown 
Of triumph that insulting vanity; 
Then cruel, by thir sports to blood enur'd 
Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts expos'd, 
Luxurious by thir wealth, and greedier still, 
And from the daily Scene effeminate. 
What wise and valiant man would seek to free 
These thus degenerate, by themselves enslav'd, 
Or could of inward slaves make outward free? 
Know therefore when my season comes to sit 
On David's Throne, it shall be like a tree 
Spreading and over-shadowing all the Earth, 
Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash 
All Monarchies besides throughout the world, 
And of my Kingdom there shall be no end: 
Means there shall be to this, but what the means, 
Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell. 
   To whom the Tempter impudent repli'd. 
I see all offers made by me how slight 
Thou valu'st, because offer'd, and reject'st: 
Nothing will please the difficult and nice, 
Or nothing more then still to contradict: 
On the other side know also thou, that I 
On what I offer set as high esteem, 
Nor what I part with mean to give for naught; 
All these which in a moment thou behold'st, 
The Kingdoms of the world to thee I give; 
For giv'n to me, I give to whom I please, 
No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else, 
On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, 
And worship me as thy superior Lord, 
Easily done, and hold them all of me; 
For what can less so great a gift deserve? 
   Whom thus our Saviour answer'd with disdain. 
I never lik'd thy talk, thy offers less, 
Now both abhor, since thou hast dar'd to utter 
The abominable terms, impious condition; 
But I endure the time, till which expir'd, 
Thou hast permission on me.   It is written 
The first of all Commandments, Thou shalt worship 
The Lord thy God, and only him shalt serve; 
And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound 
To worship thee accurst, now more accurst 
For this attempt bolder then that on Eve, 
And more blasphemous? which expect to rue. 
The Kingdoms of the world to thee were giv'n, 
Permitted rather, and by thee usurp't, 
Other donation none thou canst produce: 
If given, by whom but by the King of Kings, 
God over all supreme? if giv'n to thee, 
By thee how fairly is the Giver now 
Repaid?   But gratitude in thee is lost 
Long since.   Wert thou so void of fear or shame, 
As offer them to me the Son of God, 
To me my own, on such abhorred pact, 
That I fall down and worship thee as God? 
Get thee behind me; plain thou now appear'st 
That Evil one, Satan for ever damn'd. 
   To whom the Fiend with fear abasht reply'd. 
Be not so sore offended, Son of God; 
Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men, 
If I to try whether in higher sort 
Then these thou bear'st that title, have propos'd 
What both from Men and Angels I receive, 
Tetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the earth 
Nations besides from all the quarter'd winds, 
God of this world invok't and world beneath; 
Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold 
To me so fatal, me it most concerns. 
The tryal hath indamag'd thee no way, 
Rather more honour left and more esteem; 
Me naught advantag'd, missing what I aim'd. 
Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, 
The Kingdoms of this world; I shall no more 
Advise thee, gain them as thou canst, or not. 
And thou thy self seem'st otherwise inclin'd 
Then to a worldly Crown, addicted more 
To contemplation and profound dispute, 
As by that early action may be judg'd, 
When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou went'st 
Alone into the Temple; there was found 
Among the gravest Rabbies disputant 
On points and questions fitting Moses Chair, 
Teaching not taught; the childhood shews the man, 
As morning shews the day.   Be famous then 
By wisdom; as thy Empire must extend, 
So let extend thy mind o're all the world, 
In knowledge, all things in it comprehend, 
All knowledge is not couch't in Moses Law, 
The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote, 
The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach 
To admiration, led by Natures light; 
And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, 
Ruling them by perswasion as thou mean'st, 
Without thir learning how wilt thou with them, 
Or they with thee hold conversation meet? 
How wilt thou reason with them, how refute 
Thir Idolisms, Traditions, Paradoxes? 
Error by his own arms is best evinc't. 
Look once more e're we leave this specular Mount 
Westward, much nearer by Southwest, behold 
Where on the Ægean shore a City stands 
Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil, 
Athens the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts 
And Eloquence, native to famous wits 
Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, 
City or Suburban, studious walks and shades; 
See there the Olive Grove of Academe, 
Plato's retirement, where the Attic Bird 
Trills her thick-warbl'd notes the summer long, 
There flowrie hill Hymettus with the sound 
Of Bees industrious murmur oft invites 
To studious musing; there Ilissus rouls 
His whispering stream; within the walls then view 
The schools of antient Sages; his who bred 
Great Alexander to subdue the world, 
Lyceum there, and painted Stoa next: 
There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power 
Of harmony in tones and numbers hit 
By voice or hand, and various-measur'd verse, 
Æolian charms and Dorian Lyric Odes, 
And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, 
Blind Melesigenes thence Homer call'd, 
Whose Poem Phoebus challeng'd for his own. 
Thence what the lofty grave Tragoedians taught 
In Chorus or Iambic, teachers best 
Of moral prudence, with delight receiv'd 
In brief sententious precepts, while they treat 
Of fate, and chance, and change in human life; 
High actions, and high passions best describing: 
Thence to the famous Orators repair, 
Those antient, whose resistless eloquence 
Wielded at will that fierce Democratie, 
Shook the Arsenal and fulmin'd over Greece, 
To Macedon, and Artaxerxes Throne; 
To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, 
From Heaven descended to the low-rooft house 
Of Socrates, see there his Tenement, 
Whom well inspir'd the Oracle pronounc'd 
Wisest of men; from whose mouth issu'd forth 
Mellifluous streams that water'd all the schools 
Of Academics old and new, with those 
Sirnam'd Peripatetics, and the Sect 
Epicurean, and the Stoic severe; 
These here revolve, or, as thou lik'st, at home, 
Till time mature thee to a Kingdom's waight; 
These rules will render thee a King compleat 
Within thy self, much more with Empire joyn'd. 
   To whom our Saviour sagely thus repli'd. 
Think not but that I know these things, or think 
I know them not; not therefore am I short 
Of knowing what I aught: he who receives 
Light from above, from the fountain of light, 
No other doctrine needs, though granted true; 
But these are false, or little else but dreams, 
Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. 
The first and wisest of them all profess'd 
To know this only, that he nothing knew; 
The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits, 
A third sort doubted all things, though plain sence; 
Others in vertue plac'd felicity, 
But vertue joyn'd with riches and long life, 
In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease, 
The Stoic last in Philosophic pride, 
By him call'd vertue; and his vertuous man, 
Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing 
Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, 
As fearing God nor man, contemning all 
Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life, 
Which when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can, 
For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, 
Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. 
Alas what can they teach, and not mislead; 
Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, 
And how the world began, and how man fell 
Degraded by himself, on grace depending? 
Much of the Soul they talk, but all awrie, 
And in themselves seek vertue, and to themselves 
All glory arrogate, to God give none, 
Rather accuse him under usual names, 
Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite 
Of mortal things.   Who therefore seeks in these 
True wisdom, finds her not, or by delusion 
Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, 
An empty cloud.   However many books 
Wise men have said are wearisom; who reads 
Incessantly, and to his reading brings not 
A spirit and judgment equal or superior, 
(And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek) 
Uncertain and unsettl'd still remains, 
Deep verst in books and shallow in himself, 
Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys, 
And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge; 
As Children gathering pibles on the shore. 
Or if I would delight my private hours 
With Music or with Poem, where so soon 
As in our native Language can I find 
That solace?   All our Law and Story strew'd 
With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib'd, 
Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon, 
That pleas'd so well our Victors ear, declare 
That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv'd; 
Ill imitated, while they loudest sing 
The vices of thir Deities, and thir own 
In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating 
Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. 
Remove their swelling Epithetes thick laid 
As varnish on a Harlots cheek, the rest, 
Thin sown with aught of profit or delight, 
Will far be found unworthy to compare 
With Sion's songs, to all true tasts excelling, 
Where God is prais'd aright, and Godlike men, 
The Holiest of Holies, and his Saints; 
Such are from God inspir'd, not such from thee; 
Unless where moral vertue is express't 
By light of Nature not in all quite lost. 
Thir Orators thou then extoll'st, as those 
The top of Eloquence, Statists indeed, 
And lovers of thir Country, as may seem; 
But herein to our Prophets far beneath, 
As men divinely taught, and better teaching 
The solid rules of Civil Government 
In thir majestic unaffected stile 
Then all the Oratory of Greece and Rome. 
In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, 
What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it so, 
What ruins Kingdoms, and lays Cities flat; 
These only with our Law best form a King. 
   So spake the Son of God; but Satan now 
Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent, 
Thus to our Saviour with stern brow reply'd. 
   Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor arts, 
Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor aught 
By me propos'd in life contemplative, 
Or active, tended on by glory, or fame, 
What dost thou in this World? the Wilderness 
For thee is fittest place, I found thee there, 
And thither will return thee, yet remember 
What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have cause 
To wish thou never hadst rejected thus 
Nicely or cautiously my offer'd aid, 
Which would have set thee in short time with ease 
On David's Throne; or Throne of all the world, 
Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, 
When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill'd. 
Now contrary, if I read aught in Heaven, 
Or Heav'n write aught of Fate, by what the Stars 
Voluminous, or single characters, 
In their conjunction met, give me to spell, 
Sorrows, and labours, opposition, hate, 
Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, injuries, 
Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel death, 
A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, 
Real or Allegoric I discern not, 
Nor when, eternal sure, as without end, 
Without beginning; for no date prefixt 
Directs me in the Starry Rubric set. 
   So saying he took (for still he knew his power 
Not yet expir'd) and to the Wilderness 
Brought back the Son of God, and left him there, 
Feigning to disappear.   Darkness now rose, 
As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night 
Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both, 
Privation meer of light and absent day. 
Our Saviour meek and with untroubl'd mind 
After his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore, 
Hungry and cold betook him to his rest, 
Wherever, under some concourse of shades 
Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield 
From dews and damps of night his shelter'd head, 
But shelter'd slept in vain, for at his head 
The Tempter watch'd, and soon with ugly dreams 
Disturb'd his sleep; and either Tropic now 
Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n, the Clouds 
From many a horrid rift abortive pour'd 
Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire 
In ruine reconcil'd: nor slept the winds 
Within thir stony caves, but rush'd abroad 
From the four hinges of the world, and fell 
On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, 
Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks 
Bow'd their Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, 
Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, 
O patient Son of God, yet only stoodst 
Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror there, 
Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round 
Environ'd thee, some howl'd, some yell'd, some shriek'd, 
Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou 
Sat'st unappall'd in calm and sinless peace. 
Thus pass'd the night so foul till morning fair 
Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray; 
Who with her radiant finger still'd the roar 
Of thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds, 
And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais'd 
To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. 
And now the Sun with more effectual beams 
Had chear'd the face of Earth, and dry'd the wet 
From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds 
Who all things now behold more fresh and green, 
After a night of storm so ruinous, 
Clear'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray 
To gratulate the sweet return of morn; 
Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn 
Was absent, after all his mischief done, 
The Prince of darkness, glad would also seem 
Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came, 
Yet with no new device, they all were spent, 
Rather by this his last affront resolv'd, 
Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, 
And mad despight to be so oft repell'd. 
Him walking on a Sunny hill he found, 
Back'd on the North and West by a thick wood, 
Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape; 
And in a careless mood thus to him said. 
   Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God, 
After a dismal night; I heard the rack 
As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self 
Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them 
As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven, 
Or to the Earths dark basis underneath, 
Are to the main as inconsiderable, 
And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze 
To mans less universe, and soon are gone; 
Yet as being oft times noxious where they light 
On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent, 
Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, 
Over whose heads they rore, and seem to point, 
They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill: 
This Tempest at this Desert most was bent; 
Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. 
Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject 
The perfet season offer'd with my aid 
To win thy destin'd seat, but wilt prolong 
All to the push of Fate, persue thy way 
Of gaining David's Throne no man knows when, 
For both the when and how is no where told, 
Thou shalt be what thou art ordain'd, no doubt; 
For Angels have proclaim'd it, but concealing 
The time and means: each act is rightliest done, 
Not when it must, but when it may be best. 
If thou observe not this, be sure to find, 
What I foretold thee, many a hard assay 
Of dangers, and adversities and pains, 
E're thou of Israel's Scepter get fast hold; 
Whereof this ominous night that clos'd thee round, 
So many terrors, voices, prodigies 
May warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign. 
   So talk'd he, while the Son of God went on 
And staid not, but in brief him answer'd thus. 
   Mee worse then wet thou find'st not; other harm 
Those terrors which thou speak'st of, did me none; 
I never fear'd they could, though noising loud 
And threatning nigh; what they can do as signs 
Betok'ning, or ill boding, I contemn 
As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; 
Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing, 
Obtrud'st thy offer'd aid, that I accepting 
At least might seem to hold all power of thee, 
Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God, 
And storm'st refus'd, thinking to terrifie 
Mee to thy will; desist, thou art discern'd 
And toil'st in vain, nor me in vain molest. 
   To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply'd: 
Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born; 
For Son of God to me is yet in doubt, 
Of the Messiah I have heard foretold 
By all the Prophets; of thy birth at length 
Announc't by Gabriel with the first I knew, 
And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field, 
On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. 
From that time seldom have I ceas'd to eye 
Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, 
Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; 
Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all 
Flock'd to the Baptist, I among the rest, 
Though not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from Heav'n 
Heard thee pronounc'd the Son of God belov'd. 
Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view 
And narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn 
In what degree or meaning thou art call'd 
The Son of God, which bears no single sence; 
The Son of God I also am, or was, 
And if I was, I am; relation stands; 
All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought 
In some respect far higher so declar'd. 
Therefore I watch'd thy footsteps from that hour, 
And follow'd thee still on to this wast wild; 
Where by all best conjectures I collect 
Thou art to be my fatal enemy. 
Good reason then, if I before-hand seek 
To understand my Adversary, who 
And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent, 
By parl, or composition, truce, or league 
To win him, or win from him what I can. 
And opportunity I here have had 
To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee 
Proof against all temptation as a rock 
Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm 
To the utmost of meer man both wise and good, 
Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory 
Have been before contemn'd, and may agen: 
Therefore to know what more thou art then man, 
Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heav'n, 
Another method I must now begin. 
   So saying he caught him up, and without wing 
Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime 
Over the Wilderness and o're the Plain; 
Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, 
The holy City lifted high her Towers, 
And higher yet the glorious Temple rear'd 
Her pile, far off appearing like a Mount 
Of Alabaster, top't with Golden Spires: 
There on the highest Pinacle he set 
The Son of God; and added thus in scorn: 
   There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright 
Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house 
Have brought thee, and highest plac't, highest is best, 
Now shew thy Progeny; if not to stand, 
Cast thy self down; safely if Son of God: 
For it is written, He will give command 
Concerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands 
They shall up lift thee, lest at any time 
Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone. 
   To whom thus Jesus: also it is written, 
Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood. 
But Satan smitten with amazement fell 
As when Earths Son Antæus (to compare 
Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove 
With Joves Alcides, and oft foil'd still rose, 
Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, 
Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn'd, 
Throttl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and fell; 
So after many a foil the Tempter proud, 
Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride 
Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall. 
And as that Theban Monster that propos'd 
Her riddle, and him, who solv'd it not, devour'd; 
That once found out and solv'd, for grief and spight 
Cast her self headlong from th' Ismenian steep, 
So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend, 
And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought 
Joyless triumphals of his hop't success, 
Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, 
Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. 
So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe 
Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, 
Who on their plumy Vans receiv'd him soft 
From his uneasie station, and upbore 
As on a floating couch through the blithe Air, 
Then in a flowry valley set him down 
On a green bank, and set before him spred 
A table of Celestial Food, Divine, 
Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life, 
And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink, 
That soon refresh'd him wearied, and repair'd 
What hunger, if aught hunger had impair'd, 
Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires 
Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory 
Over temptation, and the Tempter proud. 
   True Image of the Father whether thron'd 
In the bosom of bliss, and light of light 
Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin'd 
In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, 
Wandring the Wilderness, whatever place, 
Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing 
The Son of God, with Godlike force indu'd 
Against th' Attempter of thy Fathers Throne, 
And Thief of Paradise; him long of old 
Thou didst debel, and down from Heav'n cast 
With all his Army, now thou hast aveng'd 
Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing 
Temptation, hast regain'd lost Paradise, 
And frustrated the conquest fraudulent: 
He never more henceforth will dare set foot 
In Paradise to tempt; his snares are broke: 
For though that seat of earthly bliss be fail'd, 
A fairer Paradise is founded now 
For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom thou 
A Saviour art come down to re-install. 
Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be 
Of Tempter and Temptation without fear. 
But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not long 
Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal Star 
Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav'n trod down 
Under his feet: for proof, e're this thou feel'st 
Thy wound, yet not thy last and deadliest wound 
By this repulse receiv'd, and hold'st in Hell 
No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues 
Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with awe 
To dread the Son of God: he all unarm'd 
Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice 
From thy Demoniac holds, possession foul, 
Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall flye, 
And beg to hide them in a herd of Swine, 
Lest he command them down into the deep 
Bound, and to torment sent before thir time. 
Hail Son of the most High, heir of both worlds, 
Queller of Satan, on thy glorious work 
Now enter, and begin to save mankind. 
   Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek 
Sung Victor, and from Heavenly Feast refresht 
Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv'd

       That piece of beauty passes?
There was a time when I did vow
       To that alone;
   But mark the fate of faces;
The red and white works now no more on me
Than if it could not charm, or I not see.

And yet the face continues good,
       And I have still desires,
Am still the selfsame flesh and blood,
       As apt to melt
   And suffer from those fires;
Oh some kind pow’r unriddle where it lies,
Whether my heart be faulty, or her eyes?

She ev’ry day her man does kill,
       And I as often die;
Neither her power then, nor my will
       Can question’d be.

Have certain periods set, and hidden fates.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Love', 'Desire', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Unrequited Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Sonnet', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45248/sonnet-1-dost-see-how-unregarded-now,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sir-john-suckling,,1609.0,1642.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Sir John Suckling,1609–1642,from A Ballad Upon A Wedding,"I tell thee, Dick, where I have been,
Where I the rarest things have seen;
     Oh, things without compare!
Such sights again cannot be found
In any place on English ground,
     Be it at wake, or fair.

At Charing-Cross, hard by the way,
Where we (thou know’st) do sell our hay,
     There is a house with stairs;
And there did I see coming down
Such folk as are not in our town,
     Vorty, at least, in pairs.

Amongst the rest, one pest’lent fine
(His beard no bigger though than thine)
     Walk’d on before the rest:
Our landlord looks like nothing to him:
The King (God bless him) ’twould undo him,
     Should he go still so drest.

At Course-a-Park, without all doubt,
He should have first been taken out
     By all the maids i’th’ town:
Though lusty Roger there had been,
Or little George upon the Green,
     Or Vincent of the Crown.

But wot you what? the youth was going
To make an end of all his wooing;
     The parson for him stay’d:
Yet by his leave (for all his haste),
He did not so much wish all past
     (Perchance), as did the maid.

The maid (and thereby hangs a tale)
For such a maid no Whitsun-ale
     Could ever yet produce:
No grape, that’s kindly ripe, could be
So round, so plump, so soft as she,
     Nor half so full of juice.

Her finger was so small, the ring
Would not stay on, which they did bring;
     It was too wide a peck:
And to say truth (for out it must)
It look’d like the great collar (just)
     About our young colt’s neck.

Her feet beneath her petticoat,
Like little mice, stole in and out,
     As if they fear’d the light:
But oh! she dances such a way
No sun upon an Easter-day
     Is half so fine a sight.

He would have kissed her once or twice,
But she would not, she was nice,
     She would not do’t in sight,
And then she looked as who should say
I will do what I list to day;
     And you shall do’t at night.

Her cheeks so rare a white was on,
No daisy makes comparison,
     (Who sees them is undone);
For streaks of red were mingled there,
Such as are on a Catherine pear
     (The side that’s next the sun).

Her lips were red, and one was thin,
Compar’d to that was next her chin;
     (Some bee had stung it newly);
But (Dick) her eyes so guard her face,
I durst no more upon them gaze
     Than on the sun in July.

Her mouth so small, when she does speak,
Thou’dst swear her teeth her words did break,
     That they might passage get;
But she so handled still the matter,
They came as good as ours, or better,
     And are not spent a whit.

If wishing should be any sin,
The Parson himself had guilty been;
     (She looked that day so purely,)
And did the youth so oft the feat
At night, as some did in conceit,
     It would have spoil’d him, surely.

Passion o’ me, how I run on!
There’s that that would be thought upon
     (I trow) besides the bride.
The business of the kitchen’s great,
For it is fit that men should eat;
     Nor was it there denied.

Just in the nick the cook knock’d thrice,
And all the waiters in a trice
     His summons did obey:
Each serving-man, with dish in hand,
March’d boldly up, like our train’d band,
     Presented, and away.

When all the meat was on the table,
What man of knife or teeth was able
     To stay to be intreated?
And this the very reason was,
Before the parson could say grace,
     The company was seated.

Now hats fly off, and youths carouse,
Healths first go round, and then the house,
     The bride’s came thick and thick;
And when ’twas nam’d another’s health,
Perhaps he made it hers by stealth;
     And who could help it, Dick?

O’ th’ sudden up they rise and dance;
Then sit again and sigh, and glance;
     Then dance again and kiss:
Thus sev’ral ways the time did pass,
Whilst ev’ry woman wish’d her place,
     And ev’ry man wish’d his.

By this time all were stol’n aside
To counsel and undress the Bride;
     But that he must not know:
But yet ’twas thought he guess’d her mind,
And did not mean to stay behind
     Above an hour or so.

When in he came (Dick) there she lay
Like new-fal’n snow melting away,
     (’Twas time I trow to part)
Kisses were now the only stay,
Which soon she gave, as who would say,
     Good Boy! with all my heart.

But just as heav’ns would have to cross it,
In came the Bridemaids with the Posset:
     The Bridegroom eat in spite;
For had he left the Women to’t
It would have cost two hours to do’t,
     Which were too much that night.

At length the candles out and out,
All that they had not done, they do’t:
     What that is, who can tell?
But I believe it was no more
Then thou and I have done before
     With Bridget, and with Nell.",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45243/a-ballad-upon-a-wedding,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sir-john-suckling,,1609.0,1642.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Richard Crashaw,1612–1649,A Hymn to the Name and Honour of the Admirable Saint Teresa,"Love, thou are absolute sole lord
Of life and death. To prove the word,
We’ll now appeal to none of all
Those thy old soldiers, great and tall,
Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach down
With strong arms their triumphant crown;
Such as could with lusty breath
Speak loud into the face of death
Their great Lord’s glorious name; to none
Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne
For love at large to fill; spare blood and sweat,
And see him take a private seat,
Making his mansion in the mild
And milky soul of a soft child.

    Scarce has she learn’d to lisp the name
Of martyr, yet she thinks it shame
Life should so long play with that breath
Which spent can buy so brave a death.
She never undertook to know
What death with love should have to do;
Nor has she e’er yet understood
Why to show love she should shed blood;
Yet though she cannot tell you why,
She can love, and she can die.

    Scarce has she blood enough to make
A guilty sword blush for her sake;
Yet has she’a heart dares hope to prove
How much less strong is death than love.

    Be love but there, let poor six years
Be pos’d with the maturest fears
Man trembles at, you straight shall find
Love knows no nonage, nor the mind.
’Tis love, not years or limbs that can
Make the martyr, or the man.

    Love touch’d her heart, and lo it beats
High, and burns with such brave heats,
Such thirsts to die, as dares drink up
A thousand cold deaths in one cup.
Good reason, for she breathes all fire;
Her weak breast heaves with strong desire
Of what she may with fruitless wishes
Seek for amongst her mother’s kisses.

    Since ’tis not to be had at home,
She’ll travel to a martyrdom.
No home for hers confesses she
But where she may a martyr be.

     She’ll to the Moors, and trade with them
For this unvalued diadem.
She’ll offer them her dearest breath,
With Christ’s name in ’t, in change for death.
She’ll bargain with them, and will give
Them God; teach them how to live
In him; or, if they this deny,
For him she’ll teach them how to die.
So shall she leave amongst them sown
Her Lord’s blood, or at least her own.

    Farewell then, all the world, adieu!
Teresa is no more for you.
Farewell, all pleasures, sports, and joys,
(Never till now esteemed toys)
Farewell, whatever dear may be,
Mother’s arms or father’s knee,
Farewell house and farewell home,
She’s for the Moors, and martyrdom!

    Sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair spouse,
Whom thou seek’st with so swift vows,
Calls thee back, and bids thee come
T’ embrace a milder martyrdom.

    Blest powers forbid thy tender life
Should bleed upon a barbarous knife;
Or some base hand have power to rase
Thy breast’s chaste cabinet, and uncase
A soul kept there so sweet; oh no,
Wise Heav’n will never have it so;
Thou art Love’s victim, and must die
A death more mystical and high;
Into Love’s arms thou shalt let fall
A still-surviving funeral.
He is the dart must make the death
Whose stroke shall taste thy hallow’d breath;
A dart thrice dipp’d in that rich flame
Which writes thy spouse’s radiant name
Upon the roof of heav’n, where aye
It shines, and with a sovereign ray
Beats bright upon the burning faces
Of souls, which in that name’s sweet graces
Find everlasting smiles. So rare,
So spiritual, pure, and fair
Must be th’ immortal instrument
Upon whose choice point shall be sent
A life so lov’d; and that there be
Fit executioners for thee,
The fair’st and first-born sons of fire,
Blest Seraphim, shall leave their quire
And turn Love’s soldiers, upon thee
To exercise their archery.

    Oh, how oft shalt thou complain
Of a sweet and subtle pain,
Of intolerable joys,
Of a death in which who dies
Loves his death, and dies again,
And would forever so be slain,
And lives and dies, and knows not why
To live, but that he thus may never leave to die.

    How kindly will thy gentle heart
Kiss the sweetly-killing dart!
And close in his embraces keep
Those delicious wounds, that weep
Balsam to heal themselves with. Thus
When these thy deaths, so numerous,
Shall all at last die into one,
And melt thy soul’s sweet mansion
Like a soft lump of incense, hasted
By too hot a fire, and wasted
Into perfuming clouds, so fast
Shalt thou exhale to Heav’n at last
In a resolving sigh; and then,
O what? Ask not the tongues of men;
Angels cannot tell; suffice,
Thyself shall feel thine own full joys
And hold them fast forever. There
So soon as thou shalt first appear,
The moon of maiden stars, thy white
Mistress, attended by such bright
Souls as thy shining self, shall come
And in her first ranks make thee room;
Where ’mongst her snowy family
Immortal welcomes wait for thee.

    O what delight, when reveal’d Life shall stand
And teach thy lips heav’n with his hand,
On which thou now mayst to thy wishes
Heap up thy consecrated kisses.
What joys shall seize thy soul when she,
Bending her blessed eyes on thee,
(Those second smiles of heav’n) shall dart
Her mild rays through thy melting heart!

    Angels, thy old friends, there shall greet thee,
Glad at their own home now to meet thee.

    All thy good works which went before
And waited for thee, at the door,
Shall own thee there, and all in one
Weave a constellation
Of crowns, with which the King, thy spouse,
Shall build up thy triumphant brows.

    All thy old woes shall now smile on thee,
And thy pains sit bright upon thee;
All thy sorrows here shall shine,
All thy suff’rings be divine;
Tears shall take comfort and turn gems,
And wrongs repent to diadems.
Ev’n thy deaths shall live, and new
Dress the soul that erst they slew;
Thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars
As keep account of the Lamb’s wars.

    Those rare works where thou shalt leave writ
Love’s noble history, with wit
Taught thee by none but him, while here
They feed our souls, shall clothe thine there.
Each heav’nly word by whose hid flame
Our hard hearts shall strike fire, the same
Shall flourish on thy brows, and be
Both fire to us and flame to thee,
Whose light shall live bright in thy face
By glory, in our hearts by grace.

    Thou shalt look round about and see
Thousands of crown’d souls throng to be
Themselves thy crown; sons of thy vows,
The virgin-births with which thy sovereign spouse
Made fruitful thy fair soul, go now
And with them all about thee, bow
To him. “Put on,” he’ll say, “put on,
My rosy love, that thy rich zone
Sparkling with the sacred flames
Of thousand souls whose happy names
Heav’n keeps upon thy score. Thy bright
Life brought them first to kiss the light
That kindled them to stars.” And so
Thou with the Lamb, thy Lord, shalt go,
And wheresoe’er he sets his white
Steps, walk with him those ways of light
Which who in death would live to see
Must learn in life to die like thee.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'Social Commentaries', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44057/a-hymn-to-the-name-and-honour-of-the-admirable-saint-teresa,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/richard-crashaw,,1612.0,1649.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

O heart, the equal poise of love’s both parts,
Big alike with wounds and darts,
Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same,
And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame;
Live here, great heart, and love and die and kill,
And bleed and wound, and yield and conquer still.
Let this immortal life, where’er it comes,
Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms;
Let mystic deaths wait on ’t, and wise souls be
The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.
O sweet incendiary! show here thy art,
Upon this carcass of a hard cold heart,
Let all thy scatter’d shafts of light, that play
Among the leaves of thy large books of day,
Combin’d against this breast, at once break in
And take away from me my self and sin;
This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be,
And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.
O thou undaunted daughter of desires!
By all thy dow’r of lights and fires,
By all the eagle in thee, all the dove,
By all thy lives and deaths of love,
By thy large draughts of intellectual day,
And by thy thirsts of love more large than they,
By all thy brim-fill’d bowls of fierce desire,
By thy last morning’s draught of liquid fire,
By the full kingdom of that final kiss
That seiz’d thy parting soul and seal’d thee his,
By all the heav’ns thou hast in him,
Fair sister of the seraphim!
By all of him we have in thee,
Leave nothing of my self in me:

Unto all life of mine may die.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'Relationships', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44056/the-flaming-heart,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/richard-crashaw,,1612.0,1649.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,A Dialogue between Old England and New,"New England. 
Alas, dear Mother, fairest Queen and best, 
With honour, wealth, and peace happy and blest, 
What ails thee hang thy head, and cross thine arms, 
And sit i’ the dust to sigh these sad alarms? 
What deluge of new woes thus over-whelm 
The glories of thy ever famous Realm? 
What means this wailing tone, this mournful guise? 
Ah, tell thy Daughter; she may sympathize. 
 
Old England. 
Art ignorant indeed of these my woes, 
Or must my forced tongue these griefs disclose, 
And must my self dissect my tatter’d state, 
Which Amazed Christendom stands wondering at? 
And thou a child, a Limb, and dost not feel 
My weak’ned fainting body now to reel? 
This physic-purging-potion I have taken 
Will bring Consumption or an Ague quaking, 
Unless some Cordial thou fetch from high, 
Which present help may ease my malady. 
If I decease, dost think thou shalt survive? 
Or by my wasting state dost think to thrive? 
Then weigh our case, if ‘t be not justly sad. 
Let me lament alone, while thou art glad. 
 
New England. 
And thus, alas, your state you much deplore 
In general terms, but will not say wherefore. 
What Medicine shall I seek to cure this woe, 
If th’ wound’s so dangerous, I may not know? 
But you, perhaps, would have me guess it out. 
What, hath some Hengist like that Saxon stout 
By fraud and force usurp’d thy flow’ring crown, 
Or by tempestuous Wars thy fields trod down? 
Or hath Canutus, that brave valiant Dane, 
The regal peaceful Sceptre from thee ta’en? 
Or is 't a Norman whose victorious hand 
With English blood bedews thy conquered Land? 
Or is ‘t intestine Wars that thus offend? 
Do Maud and Stephen for the Crown contend? 
Do Barons rise and side against their King, 
And call in Foreign aid to help the thing? 
Must Edward be depos’d? Or is ‘t the hour 
That second Richard must be clapp’d i’ th’ Tower? 
Or is it the fatal jar, again begun, 
That from the red, white pricking Roses sprung? 
Must Richmond’s aid the Nobles now implore 
To come and break the tushes of the Boar? 
If none of these, dear Mother, what’s your woe? 
Pray, do not fear Spain’s bragging Armado. 
Doth your Ally, fair France, conspire your wrack, 
Or doth the Scots play false behind your back? 
Doth Holland quit you ill for all your love? 
Whence is this storm, from Earth or Heaven above? 
Is ‘t drought, is ‘t Famine, or is ‘t Pestilence? 
Dost feel the smart, or fear the consequence? 
Your humble Child entreats you shew your grief. 
Though Arms nor Purse she hath for your relief— 
Such is her poverty,—yet shall be found 
A suppliant for your help, as she is bound. 
 
Old England. 
I must confess some of those Sores you name 
My beauteous Body at this present maim, 
But foreign Foe nor feigned friend I fear, 
For they have work enough, thou knowest, elsewhere. 
Nor is it Alcie’s son and Henry’s Daughter 
Whose proud contention cause this slaughter; 
Nor Nobles siding to make John no King, 
French Louis unjustly to the Crown to bring; 
No Edward, Richard, to lose rule and life, 
Nor no Lancastrians to renew old strife; 
No Crook-backt Tyrant now usurps the Seat, 
Whose tearing tusks did wound, and kill, and threat. 
No Duke of York nor Earl of March to soil 
Their hands in Kindred’s blood whom they did foil; 
No need of Tudor Roses to unite: 
None knows which is the Red or which the White. 
Spain’s braving Fleet a second time is sunk. 
France knows how of my fury she hath drunk 
By Edward third and Henry fifth of fame; 
Her Lilies in my Arms avouch the same. 
My Sister Scotland hurts me now no more, 
Though she hath been injurious heretofore. 
What Holland is, I am in some suspense, 
But trust not much unto his Excellence. 
For wants, sure some I feel, but more I fear; 
And for the Pestilence, who knows how near? 
Famine and Plague, two sisters of the Sword, 
Destruction to a Land doth soon afford. 
They’re for my punishments ordain'd on high, 
Unless thy tears prevent it speedily. 
But yet I answer not what you demand 
To shew the grievance of my troubled Land. 
Before I tell the effect I’ll shew the cause, 
Which are my sins—the breach of sacred Laws: 
Idolatry, supplanter of a Nation, 
With foolish superstitious adoration, 
Are lik’d and countenanc’d by men of might, 
The Gospel is trod down and hath no right. 
Church Offices are sold and bought for gain 
That Pope had hope to find Rome here again. 
For Oaths and Blasphemies did ever ear 
From Beelzebub himself such language hear? 
What scorning of the Saints of the most high! 
What injuries did daily on them lie! 
What false reports, what nick-names did they take, 
Not for their own, but for their Master’s sake! 
And thou, poor soul, wast jeer’d among the rest; 
Thy flying for the Truth I made a jest. 
For Sabbath-breaking and for Drunkenness 
Did ever Land profaneness more express? 
From crying bloods yet cleansed am not I, 
Martyrs and others dying causelessly. 
How many Princely heads on blocks laid down 
For nought but title to a fading Crown! 
‘Mongst all the cruelties which I have done, 
Oh, Edward’s Babes, and Clarence’s hapless Son, 
O Jane, why didst thou die in flow’ring prime?— 
Because of Royal Stem, that was thy crime. 
For Bribery, Adultery, for Thefts, and Lies 
Where is the Nation I can’t paralyze? 
With Usury, Extortion, and Oppression, 
These be the Hydras of my stout transgression; 
These be the bitter fountains, heads, and roots 
Whence flow’d the source, the sprigs, the boughs, and fruits. 
Of more than thou canst hear or I relate, 
That with high hand I still did perpetrate, 
For these were threat’ned the woeful day 
I mocked the Preachers, put it fair away. 
The Sermons yet upon record do stand 
That cried destruction to my wicked Land. 
These Prophets’ mouths (all the while) was stopt, 
Unworthily, some backs whipt, and ears crept; 
Their reverent cheeks bear the glorious marks 
Of stinking, stigmatizing Romish Clerks; 
Some lost their livings, some in prison pent, 
Some grossly fined, from friends to exile went: 
Their silent tongues to heaven did vengeance cry, 
Who heard their cause, and wrongs judg’d righteously, 
And will repay it sevenfold in my lap. 
This is fore-runner of my after-clap. 
Nor took I warning by my neighbors’ falls. 
I saw sad Germany’s dismantled walls, 
I saw her people famish’d, Nobles slain, 
Her fruitful land a barren heath remain. 
I saw (unmov’d) her Armies foil’d and fled, 
Wives forc’d, babes toss’d, her houses calcined. 
I saw strong Rochelle yield’d to her foe, 
Thousands of starved Christians there also. 
I saw poor Ireland bleeding out her last, 
Such cruelty as all reports have past. 
Mine heart obdurate stood not yet aghast. 
Now sip I of that cup, and just ‘t may be 
The bottom dregs reserved are for me. 
 
New England. 
To all you’ve said, sad mother, I assent. 
Your fearful sins great cause there ‘s to lament. 
My guilty hands (in part) hold up with you, 
A sharer in your punishment’s my due. 
But all you say amounts to this effect, 
Not what you feel, but what you do expect. 
Pray, in plain terms, what is your present grief? 
Then let’s join heads and hands for your relief. 
 
Old England. 
Well, to the matter, then. There’s grown of late 
‘Twixt King and Peers a question of state: 
Which is the chief, the law, or else the King? 
One saith, it’s he; the other, no such thing. 
My better part in Court of Parliament 
To ease my groaning land shew their intent 
To crush the proud, and right to each man deal, 
To help the Church, and stay the Common-Weal. 
So many obstacles comes in their way 
As puts me to a stand what I should say. 
Old customs, new Prerogatives stood on. 
Had they not held law fast, all had been gone, 
Which by their prudence stood them in such stead 
They took high Strafford lower by the head, 
And to their Laud be ‘t spoke they held ‘n th’ Tower 
All England’s metropolitan that hour. 
This done, an Act they would have passed fain 
No prelate should his Bishopric retain. 
Here tugg’d they hard indeed, for all men saw 
This must be done by Gospel, not by law. 
Next the Militia they urged sore. 
This was denied, I need not say wherefore. 
The King, displeased, at York himself absents. 
They humbly beg return, shew their intents. 
The writing, printing, posting to and fro, 
Shews all was done; I’ll therefore let it go. 
But now I come to speak of my disaster. 
Contention’s grown ‘twixt Subjects and their Master, 
They worded it so long they fell to blows, 
That thousands lay on heaps. Here bleeds my woes. 
I that no wars so many years have known 
Am now destroy’d and slaughter’d by mine own. 
But could the field alone this strife decide, 
One battle, two, or three I might abide, 
But these may be beginnings of more woe— 
Who knows, the worst, the best may overthrow! 
Religion, Gospel, here lies at the stake, 
Pray now, dear child, for sacred Zion’s sake, 
Oh, pity me in this sad perturbation, 
My plundered Towns, my houses’ devastation, 
My ravisht virgins, and my young men slain, 
My wealthy trading fallen, my dearth of grain. 
The seedtime’s come, but Ploughman hath no hope 
Because he knows not who shall inn his crop. 
The poor they want their pay, their children bread, 
Their woful mothers’ tears unpitied. 
If any pity in thy heart remain, 
Or any child-like love thou dost retain, 
For my relief now use thy utmost skill, 
And recompense me good for all my ill. 
 
New England. 
Dear mother, cease complaints, and wipe your eyes, 
Shake off your dust, cheer up, and now arise. 
You are my mother, nurse, I once your flesh, 
Your sunken bowels gladly would refresh. 
Your griefs I pity much but should do wrong, 
To weep for that we both have pray’d for long, 
To see these latter days of hop’d-for good, 
That Right may have its right, though ‘t be with blood. 
After dark Popery the day did clear; 
But now the Sun in’s brightness shall appear. 
Blest be the Nobles of thy Noble Land 
With (ventur’d lives) for truth’s defence that stand. 
Blest be thy Commons, who for Common good 
And thy infringed Laws have boldly stood. 
Blest be thy Counties, who do aid thee still 
With hearts and states to testify their will. 
Blest be thy Preachers, who do cheer thee on. 
Oh, cry: the sword of God and Gideon! 
And shall I not on them wish Mero’s curse 
That help thee not with prayers, arms, and purse? 
And for my self, let miseries abound 
If mindless of thy state I e’er be found. 
These are the days the Church’s foes to crush, 
To root out Prelates, head, tail, branch, and rush. 
Let’s bring Baal’s vestments out, to make a fire, 
Their Mitres, Surplices, and all their tire, 
Copes, Rochets, Croziers, and such trash, 
And let their names consume, but let the flash 
Light Christendom, and all the world to see 
We hate Rome’s Whore, with all her trumpery. 
Go on, brave Essex, shew whose son thou art, 
Not false to King, nor Country in thy heart, 
But those that hurt his people and his Crown, 
By force expel, destroy, and tread them down. 
Let Gaols be fill’d with th’ remnant of that pack, 
And sturdy Tyburn loaded till it crack. 
And ye brave Nobles, chase away all fear, 
And to this blessed Cause closely adhere. 
O mother, can you weep and have such Peers? 
When they are gone, then drown your self in tears, 
If now you weep so much, that then no more 
The briny Ocean will o’erflow your shore. 
These, these are they (I trust) with Charles our king, 
Out of all mists such glorious days will bring 
That dazzled eyes, beholding, much shall wonder 
At that thy settled Peace, thy wealth, and splendour, 
Thy Church and Weal establish’d in such manner 
That all shall joy that thou display’dst thy banner, 
And discipline erected so, I trust, 
That nursing Kings shall come and lick thy dust. 
Then Justice shall in all thy Courts take place 
Without respect of persons or of case. 
Then bribes shall cease, and suits shall not stick long, 
Patience and purse of Clients for to wrong. 
Then High Commissions shall fall to decay, 
And Pursuivants and Catchpoles want their pay. 
So shall thy happy Nation ever flourish, 
When truth and righteousness they thus shall nourish. 
When thus in Peace, thine Armies brave send out 
To sack proud Rome, and all her vassals rout. 
There let thy name, thy fame, and valour shine, 
As did thine Ancestors’ in Palestine, 
And let her spoils full pay with int’rest be 
Of what unjustly once she poll’d from thee. 
Of all the woes thou canst let her be sped, 
Execute to th’ full the vengeance threatened. 
Bring forth the beast that rul’d the world with’s beck, 
And tear his flesh, and set your feet on’s neck, 
And make his filthy den so desolate 
To th’ ‘stonishment of all that knew his state. 
This done, with brandish’d swords to Turkey go,— 
(For then what is it but English blades dare do?) 
And lay her waste, for so’s the sacred doom, 
And do to Gog as thou hast done to Rome. 
Oh Abraham’s seed, lift up your heads on high, 
For sure the day of your redemption’s nigh. 
The scales shall fall from your long blinded eyes, 
And him you shall adore who now despise. 
Then fullness of the Nations in shall flow, 
And Jew and Gentile to one worship go. 
Then follows days of happiness and rest. 
Whose lot doth fall to live therein is blest. 
No Canaanite shall then be found ‘n th’ land, 
And holiness on horses’ bells shall stand. 
If this make way thereto, then sigh no more, 
But if at all thou didst not see ‘t before. 
Farewell, dear mother; Parliament, prevail, 
And in a while you’ll tell another tale.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'Other Religions', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet', 'Allusion', 'Metaphor', 'Imagery', 'Mixed']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,The Four Ages of Man,"[Introduction] 
Lo now! four other acts upon the stage, 
Childhood, and Youth, the Manly, and Old-age. 
The first: son unto Phlegm, grand-child to water, 
Unstable, supple, moist, and cold’s his Nature. 
The second: frolic claims his pedigree; 
From blood and air, for hot and moist is he. 
The third of fire and choler is compos’d, 
Vindicative, and quarrelsome dispos’d. 
The last, of earth and heavy melancholy, 
Solid, hating all lightness, and all folly. 
Childhood was cloth’d in white, and given to show, 
His spring was intermixed with some snow. 
Upon his head a Garland Nature set: 
Of Daisy, Primrose, and the Violet. 
Such cold mean flowers (as these) blossom betime, 
Before the Sun hath throughly warm’d the clime. 
His hobby striding, did not ride, but run, 
And in his hand an hour-glass new begun, 
In dangers every moment of a fall, 
And when ‘tis broke, then ends his life and all. 
But if he held till it have run its last, 
Then may he live till threescore years or past. 
Next, youth came up in gorgeous attire 
(As that fond age, doth most of all desire), 
His Suit of Crimson, and his Scarf of Green. 
In’s countenance, his pride quickly was seen. 
Garland of Roses, Pinks, and Gillyflowers 
Seemed to grow on’s head (bedew’d with showers). 
His face as fresh, as is Aurora fair, 
When blushing first, she ‘gins to red the Air. 
No wooden horse, but one of metal try’d: 
He seems to fly, or swim, and not to ride. 
Then prancing on the Stage, about he wheels; 
But as he went, death waited at his heels. 
The next came up, in a more graver sort, 
As one that cared for a good report. 
His Sword by’s side, and choler in his eyes, 
But neither us’d (as yet) for he was wise, 
Of Autumn fruits a basket on his arm, 
His golden rod in’s purse, which was his charm. 
And last of all, to act upon this Stage, 
Leaning upon his staff, comes up old age. 
Under his arm a Sheaf of wheat he bore, 
A Harvest of the best: what needs he more? 
In’s other hand a glass, ev’n almost run, 
This writ about: This out, then I am done. 
His hoary hairs and grave aspect made way, 
And all gave ear to what he had to say. 
These being met, each in his equipage 
Intend to speak, according to their age, 
But wise Old-age did with all gravity 
To childish childhood give precedency, 
And to the rest, his reason mildly told: 
That he was young, before he grew so old. 
To do as he, the rest full soon assents, 
Their method was that of the Elements, 
That each should tell what of himself he knew, 
Both good and bad, but yet no more then’s true. 
With heed now stood, three ages of frail man, 
To hear the child, who crying, thus began. 
 
Childhood 
Ah me! conceiv’d in sin, and born in sorrow, 
A nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow, 
Whose mean beginning, blushing can’t reveal, 
But night and darkness must with shame conceal. 
My mother’s breeding sickness, I will spare, 
Her nine months’ weary burden not declare. 
To shew her bearing pangs, I should do wrong, 
To tell that pain, which can’t be told by tongue. 
With tears into this world I did arrive; 
My mother still did waste, as I did thrive, 
Who yet with love and all alacity, 
Spending was willing to be spent for me. 
With wayward cries, I did disturb her rest, 
Who sought still to appease me with her breast; 
With weary arms, she danc’d, and By, By, sung, 
When wretched I (ungrate) had done the wrong. 
When Infancy was past, my Childishness 
Did act all folly that it could express. 
My silliness did only take delight, 
In that which riper age did scorn and slight, 
In Rattles, Bables, and such toyish stuff. 
My then ambitious thoughts were low enough. 
My high-born soul so straitly was confin’d 
That its own worth it did not know nor mind. 
This little house of flesh did spacious count, 
Through ignorance, all troubles did surmount, 
Yet this advantage had mine ignorance, 
Freedom from Envy and from Arrogance. 
How to be rich, or great, I did not cark, 
A Baron or a Duke ne’r made my mark, 
Nor studious was, Kings favours how to buy, 
With costly presents, or base flattery; 
No office coveted, wherein I might 
Make strong my self and turn aside weak right. 
No malice bare to this or that great Peer, 
Nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear. 
I gave no hand, nor vote, for death, of life. 
I’d nought to do, ‘twixt Prince, and peoples’ strife. 
No Statist I: nor Marti’list i’ th’ field. 
Where e’re I went, mine innocence was shield. 
My quarrels, not for Diadems, did rise, 
But for an Apple, Plumb, or some such prize. 
My strokes did cause no death, nor wounds, nor scars. 
My little wrath did cease soon as my wars. 
My duel was no challenge, nor did seek. 
My foe should weltering, with his bowels reek. 
I had no Suits at law, neighbours to vex, 
Nor evidence for land did me perplex. 
I fear’d no storms, nor all the winds that blows. 
I had no ships at Sea, no fraughts to loose. 
I fear’d no drought, nor wet; I had no crop, 
Nor yet on future things did place my hope. 
This was mine innocence, but oh the seeds 
Lay raked up of all the cursed weeds, 
Which sprouted forth in my insuing age, 
As he can tell, that next comes on the stage. 
But yet me let me relate, before I go, 
The sins and dangers I am subject to: 
From birth stained, with Adam’s sinful fact, 
From thence I ‘gan to sin, as soon as act; 
A perverse will, a love to what’s forbid; 
A serpent’s sting in pleasing face lay hid; 
A lying tongue as soon as it could speak 
And fifth Commandment do daily break; 
Oft stubborn, peevish, sullen, pout, and cry; 
Then nought can please, and yet I know not why. 
As many was my sins, so dangers too, 
For sin brings sorrow, sickness, death, and woe, 
And though I miss the tossings of the mind, 
Yet griefs in my frail flesh I still do find. 
What gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain? 
What tortures I, in breeding teeth sustain? 
What crudities my cold stomach hath bred? 
Whence vomits, worms, and flux have issued? 
What breaches, knocks, and falls I daily have? 
And some perhaps, I carry to my grave. 
Sometimes in fire, sometimes in water fall: 
Strangely preserv’d, yet mind it not at all. 
At home, abroad, my danger’s manifold 
That wonder ‘tis, my glass till now doth hold. 
I’ve done: unto my elders I give way, 
For ‘tis but little that a child can say. 
 
Youth 
My goodly clothing and beauteous skin 
Declare some greater riches are within, 
But what is best I‘ll first present to view, 
And then the worst, in a more ugly hue, 
For thus to do we on this Stage assemble, 
Then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble. 
Mine education, and my learning‘s such, 
As might my self, and others, profit much: 
With nurture trained up in virtue‘s Schools; 
Of Science, Arts, and Tongues, I know the rules; 
The manners of the Court, I likewise know, 
Nor ignorant what they in Country do. 
The brave attempts of valiant Knights I prize 
That dare climb Battlements, rear‘d to the skies. 
The snorting Horse, the Trumpet, Drum I like, 
The glist‘ring Sword, and well advanced Pike. 
I cannot lie in trench before a Town, 
Nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown. 
I scorn the heavy Corslet, Musket-proof; 
I fly to catch the Bullet that‘s aloof. 
Though thus in field, at home, to all most kind, 
So affable that I do suit each mind, 
I can insinuate into the breast 
And by my mirth can raise the heart deprest. 
Sweet Music rapteth my harmonious Soul, 
And elevates my thoughts above the Pole. 
My wit, my bounty, and my courtesy 
Makes all to place their future hopes on me. 
This is my best, but youth (is known) alas, 
To be as wild as is the snuffing Ass, 
As vain as froth, as vanity can be, 
That who would see vain man may look on me: 
My gifts abus‘d, my education lost, 
My woful Parents‘ longing hopes all crost; 
My wit evaporates in merriment; 
My valour in some beastly quarrel‘s spent; 
Martial deeds I love not, ‘cause they’re virtuous, 
But doing so, might seem magnanimous. 
My Lust doth hurry me to all that’s ill, 
I know no Law, nor reason, but my will; 
Sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse 
Or stab the man in’s own defence, that’s worse. 
Sometimes I cheat (unkind) a female Heir 
Of all at once, who not so wise, as fair, 
Trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue 
Until her friends, treasure, and honour’s gone. 
Sometimes I sit carousing others’ health 
Until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth. 
From pipe to pot, from pot to words and blows, 
For he that loveth Wine wanteth no woes. 
Days, nights, with Ruffins, Roarers, Fiddlers spend, 
To all obscenity my ears I bend, 
All counsel hate which tends to make me wise, 
And dearest friends count for mine enemies. 
If any care I take, ‘tis to be fine, 
For sure my suit more than my virtues shine. 
If any time from company I spare, 
‘Tis spent in curling, frisling up my hair, 
Some young Adonais I do strive to be. 
Sardana Pallas now survives in me. 
Cards, Dice, and Oaths, concomitant, I love; 
To Masques, to Plays, to Taverns still I move; 
And in a word, if what I am you’d hear, 
Seek out a British, bruitish Cavalier. 
Such wretch, such monster am I; but yet more 
I want a heart all this for to deplore. 
Thus, thus alas! I have mispent my time, 
My youth, my best, my strength, my bud, and prime, 
Remembring not the dreadful day of Doom, 
Nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come, 
Though dangers do attend me every hour 
And ghastly death oft threats me with her power: 
Sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken, 
Sometimes by Agues all my body shaken; 
Sometimes by Fevers, all my moisture drinking, 
My heart lies frying, and my eyes are sinking. 
Sometimes the Cough, Stitch, painful Pleurisy, 
With sad affrights of death, do menace me. 
Sometimes the loathsome Pox my face be-mars 
With ugly marks of his eternal scars. 
Sometimes the Frenzy strangely mads my Brain 
That oft for it in Bedlam I remain. 
Too many’s my Diseases to recite, 
That wonder ‘tis I yet behold the light, 
That yet my bed in darkness is not made, 
And I in black oblivion’s den long laid. 
Of Marrow full my bones, of Milk my breasts, 
Ceas’d by the gripes of Serjeant Death's Arrests: 
Thus I have said, and what I’ve said you see, 
Childhood and youth is vain, yea vanity. 
 
Middle Age 
Childhood and youth forgot, sometimes I’ve seen, 
And now am grown more staid that have been green, 
What they have done, the same was done by me: 
As was their praise, or shame, so mine must be. 
Now age is more, more good ye do expect; 
But more my age, the more is my defect. 
But what’s of worth, your eyes shall first behold, 
And then a world of dross among my gold. 
When my Wild Oats were sown, and ripe, and mown, 
I then receiv’d a harvest of mine own. 
My reason, then bad judge, how little hope 
Such empty seed should yield a better crop. 
I then with both hands graspt the world together, 
Thus out of one extreme into another, 
But yet laid hold on virtue seemingly: 
Who climbs without hold, climbs dangerously. 
Be my condition mean, I then take pains 
My family to keep, but not for gains. 
If rich, I’m urged then to gather more 
To bear me out i’ th’ world and feed the poor; 
If a father, then for children must provide, 
But if none, then for kindred near ally’d; 
If Noble, then mine honour to maintain; 
If not, yet wealth, Nobility can gain. 
For time, for place, likewise for each relation, 
I wanted not my ready allegation. 
Yet all my powers for self-ends are not spent, 
For hundreds bless me for my bounty sent, 
Whose loins I’ve cloth’d, and bellies I have fed, 
With mine own fleece, and with my household bread. 
Yea, justice I have done, was I in place, 
To cheer the good and wicked to deface. 
The proud I crush’d, th’oppressed I set free, 
The liars curb’d but nourisht verity. 
Was I a pastor, I my flock did feed 
And gently lead the lambs, as they had need. 
A Captain I, with skill I train’d my band 
And shew’d them how in face of foes to stand. 
If a Soldier, with speed I did obey 
As readily as could my Leader say. 
Was I a laborer, I wrought all day 
As cheerfully as ere I took my pay. 
Thus hath mine age (in all) sometimes done well; 
Sometimes mine age (in all) been worse than hell. 
In meanness, greatness, riches, poverty 
Did toil, did broil; oppress’d, did steal and lie. 
Was I as poor as poverty could be, 
Then baseness was companion unto me. 
Such scum as Hedges and High-ways do yield, 
As neither sow, nor reap, nor plant, nor build. 
If to Agriculture I was ordain’d, 
Great labours, sorrows, crosses I sustain’d. 
The early Cock did summon, but in vain, 
My wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain. 
For restless day and night, I’m robb’d of sleep 
By cankered care, who sentinel doth keep. 
My weary breast rest from his toil can find, 
But if I rest, the more distrest my mind. 
If happiness my sordidness hath found, 
‘Twas in the crop of my manured ground: 
My fatted Ox, and my exuberous Cow, 
My fleeced Ewe, and ever farrowing Sow. 
To greater things I never did aspire, 
My dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher. 
If to be rich, or great, it was my fate. 
How was I broil’d with envy, and with hate? 
Greater than was the great’st was my desire, 
And greater still, did set my heart on fire. 
If honour was the point to which I steer’d, 
To run my hull upon disgrace I fear’d, 
But by ambitious sails I was so carried 
That over flats, and sands, and rocks I hurried, 
Opprest, and sunk, and sack’d, all in my way 
That did oppose me to my longed bay. 
My thirst was higher than Nobility 
And oft long’d sore to taste on Royalty, 
Whence poison, Pistols, and dread instruments 
Have been curst furtherers of mine intents. 
Nor Brothers, Nephews, Sons, nor Sires I’ve spar’d. 
When to a Monarchy my way they barr'’d, 
There set, I rid my self straight out of hand 
Of such as might my son, or his withstand, 
Then heapt up gold and riches as the clay, 
Which others scatter like the dew in May. 
Sometimes vain-glory is the only bait 
Whereby my empty school is lur’d and caught. 
Be I of worth, of learning, or of parts, 
I judge I should have room in all men’s hearts; 
And envy gnaws if any do surmount. 
I hate for to be had in small account. 
If Bias like, I’m stript unto my skin; 
I glory in my wealth I have within. 
Thus good, and bad, and what I am, you see, 
Now in a word, what my diseases be: 
The vexing Stone, in bladder and in reins, 
Torments me with intolerable pains; 
The windy cholic oft my bowels rend, 
To break the darksome prison, where it’s penn’d; 
The knotty Gout doth sadly torture me, 
And the restraining lame Sciatica; 
The Quinsy and the Fevers often distaste me, 
And the Consumption to the bones doth waste me, 
Subject to all Diseases, that’s the truth, 
Though some more incident to age, or youth; 
And to conclude, I may not tedious be, 
Man at his best estate is vanity. 
 
Old Age 
What you have been, ev’n such have I before, 
And all you say, say I, and something more. 
Babe's innocence, Youth’s wildness I have seen, 
And in perplexed Middle-age have been, 
Sickness, dangers, and anxieties have past, 
And on this Stage am come to act my last. 
I have been young, and strong, and wise as you 
But now, Bis pueri senes is too true. 
In every Age I’ve found much vanity. 
An end of all perfection now I see. 
It’s not my valour, honour, nor my gold, 
My ruin’d house, now falling can uphold; 
It’s not my Learning, Rhetoric, wit so large, 
Now hath the power, Death’s Warfare, to discharge. 
It’s not my goodly house, nor bed of down, 
That can refresh, or ease, if Conscience frown; 
Nor from alliance now can I have hope, 
But what I have done well, that is my prop. 
He that in youth is godly, wise, and sage 
Provides a staff for to support his age. 
Great mutations, some joyful, and some sad, 
In this short Pilgrimage I oft have had. 
Sometimes the Heavens with plenty smil’d on me, 
Sometimes, again, rain’d all adversity; 
Sometimes in honour, sometimes in disgrace, 
Sometime an abject, then again in place: 
Such private changes oft mine eyes have seen. 
In various times of state I’ve also been. 
I’ve seen a Kingdom flourish like a tree 
When it was rul’d by that Celestial she, 
And like a Cedar others so surmount 
That but for shrubs they did themselves account. 
Then saw I France, and Holland sav’d, Calais won, 
And Philip and Albertus half undone. 
I saw all peace at home, terror to foes, 
But ah, I saw at last those eyes to close, 
And then, me thought, the world at noon grew dark 
When it had lost that radiant Sun-like spark. 
In midst of griefs, I saw some hopes revive 
(For ‘twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive); 
I saw hopes dash’t, our forwardness was shent, 
And silenc’d we, by Act of Parliament. 
I’ve seen from Rome, an execrable thing, 
A plot to blow up Nobles and their King. 
I’ve seen designs at Ree and Cades cross’t, 
And poor Palatinate for every lost. 
I’ve seen a Prince to live on others’ lands, 
A Royal one, by alms from Subjects’ hands. 
I’ve seen base men, advanc’d to great degree, 
And worthy ones, put to extremity, 
But not their Prince’s love, nor state so high, 
Could once reverse, their shameful destiny. 
I’ve seen one stabb’d, another lose his head, 
And others fly their Country through their dread. 
I’ve seen, and so have ye, for ‘tis but late, 
The desolation of a goodly State. 
Plotted and acted so that none can tell 
Who gave the counsell, but the Prince of hell. 
I’ve seen a land unmoulded with great pain, 
But yet may live to see’t made up again. 
I’ve seen it shaken, rent, and soak’d in blood, 
But out of troubles ye may see much good. 
These are no old wives’ tales, but this is truth. 
We old men love to tell, what’s done in youth. 
But I return from whence I stept awry; 
My memory is short and brain is dry. 
My Almond-tree (gray hairs) doth flourish now, 
And back, once straight, begins apace to bow. 
My grinders now are few, my sight doth fail, 
My skin is wrinkled, and my cheeks are pale. 
No more rejoice, at music’s pleasant noise, 
But do awake at the cock’s clanging voice. 
I cannot scent savours of pleasant meat, 
Nor sapors find in what I drink or eat. 
My hands and arms, once strong, have lost their might. 
I cannot labour, nor I cannot fight: 
My comely legs, as nimble as the Roe, 
Now stiff and numb, can hardly creep or go. 
My heart sometimes as fierce, as Lion bold, 
Now trembling, and fearful, sad, and cold. 
My golden Bowl and silver Cord, e’re long, 
Shall both be broke, by wracking death so strong. 
I then shall go whence I shall come no more. 
Sons, Nephews, leave, my death for to deplore. 
In pleasures, and in labours, I have found 
That earth can give no consolation sound 
To great, to rich, to poor, to young, or old, 
To mean, to noble, fearful, or to bold. 
From King to beggar, all degrees shall find 
But vanity, vexation of the mind. 
Yea, knowing much, the pleasant’st life of all 
Hath yet amongst that sweet, some bitter gall. 
Though reading others’ Works doth much refresh, 
Yet studying much brings weariness to th’ flesh. 
My studies, labours, readings all are done, 
And my last period can e’en elmost run. 
Corruption, my Father, I do call, 
Mother, and sisters both; the worms that crawl 
In my dark house, such kindred I have store. 
There I shall rest till heavens shall be no more; 
And when this flesh shall rot and be consum’d, 
This body, by this soul, shall be assum’d; 
And I shall see with these same very eyes 
My strong Redeemer coming in the skies. 
Triumph I shall, o’re Sin, o’re Death, o’re Hell, 
And in that hope, I bid you all farewell.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Time & Brevity', 'Nature', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Weather', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet', 'Metaphor']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess, Queen Elizabeth","Proem. 
Although great Queen, thou now in silence lie, 
Yet thy loud Herald Fame, doth to the sky 
Thy wondrous worth proclaim, in every clime, 
And so has vow’d, whilst there is world or time. 
So great’s thy glory, and thine excellence, 
The sound thereof raps every human sense 
That men account it no impiety 
To say thou wert a fleshly Deity. 
Thousands bring off’rings (though out of date) 
Thy world of honours to accumulate. 
‘Mongst hundred Hecatombs of roaring Verse, 
‘Mine bleating stands before thy royal Hearse. 
Thou never didst, nor canst thou now disdain, 
T’ accept the tribute of a loyal Brain. 
Thy clemency did yerst esteem as much 
The acclamations of the poor, as rich, 
Which makes me deem, my rudeness is no wrong, 
Though I resound thy greatness ‘mongst the throng. 
 
The Poem. 
No Phoenix Pen, nor Spenser’s Poetry, 
No Speed’s, nor Camden’s learned History; 
Eliza’s works, wars, praise, can e’re compact, 
The World’s the Theater where she did act. 
No memories, nor volumes can contain, 
The nine Olymp’ades of her happy reign, 
Who was so good, so just, so learn’d, so wise, 
From all the Kings on earth she won the prize. 
Nor say I more than truly is her due. 
Millions will testify that this is true. 
She hath wip’d off th’ aspersion of her Sex, 
That women wisdom lack to play the Rex. 
Spain’s Monarch sa’s not so, not yet his Host: 
She taught them better manners to their cost. 
The Salic Law had not in force now been, 
If France had ever hop’d for such a Queen. 
But can you Doctors now this point dispute, 
She’s argument enough to make you mute, 
Since first the Sun did run, his ne’er runn’d race, 
And earth had twice a year, a new old face; 
Since time was time, and man unmanly man, 
Come shew me such a Phoenix if you can. 
Was ever people better rul’d than hers? 
Was ever Land more happy, freed from stirs? 
Did ever wealth in England so abound? 
Her Victories in foreign Coasts resound? 
Ships more invincible than Spain’s, her foe 
She rack’t, she sack’d, she sunk his Armadoe. 
Her stately Troops advanc’d to Lisbon’s wall, 
Don Anthony in’s right for to install. 
She frankly help’d Franks’ (brave) distressed King, 
The States united now her fame do sing. 
She their Protectrix was, they well do know, 
Unto our dread Virago, what they owe. 
Her Nobles sacrific’d their noble blood, 
Nor men, nor coin she shap’d, to do them good. 
The rude untamed Irish she did quell, 
And Tiron bound, before her picture fell. 
Had ever Prince such Counsellors as she? 
Her self Minerva caus’d them so to be. 
Such Soldiers, and such Captains never seen, 
As were the subjects of our (Pallas) Queen: 
Her Sea-men through all straits the world did round, 
Terra incognitæ might know her sound. 
Her Drake came laded home with Spanish gold, 
Her Essex took Cadiz, their Herculean hold. 
But time would fail me, so my wit would too, 
To tell of half she did, or she could do. 
Semiramis to her is but obscure; 
More infamy than fame she did procure. 
She plac’d her glory but on Babel’s walls, 
World's wonder for a time, but yet it falls. 
Fierce Tomris (Cirus’ Heads-man, Sythians’ Queen) 
Had put her Harness off, had she but seen 
Our Amazon i’ th’ Camp at Tilbury, 
(Judging all valour, and all Majesty) 
Within that Princess to have residence, 
And prostrate yielded to her Excellence. 
Dido first Foundress of proud Carthage walls 
(Who living consummates her Funerals), 
A great Eliza, but compar’d with ours, 
How vanisheth her glory, wealth, and powers. 
Proud profuse Cleopatra, whose wrong name, 
Instead of glory, prov’d her Country’s shame: 
Of her what worth in Story’s to be seen, 
But that she was a rich Ægyptian Queen. 
Zenobia, potent Empress of the East, 
And of all these without compare the best 
(Whom none but great Aurelius could quell) 
Yet for our Queen is no fit parallel: 
She was a Phoenix Queen, so shall she be, 
Her ashes not reviv’d more Phoenix she. 
Her personal perfections, who would tell, 
Must dip his Pen i’ th’ Heliconian Well, 
Which I may not, my pride doth but aspire 
To read what others write and then admire. 
Now say, have women worth, or have they none? 
Or had they some, but with our Queen is’t gone? 
Nay Masculines, you have thus tax’d us long, 
But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong. 
Let such as say our sex is void of reason 
Know ‘tis a slander now, but once was treason. 
But happy England, which had such a Queen, 
O happy, happy, had those days still been, 
But happiness lies in a higher sphere. 
Then wonder not, Eliza moves not here. 
Full fraught with honour, riches, and with days, 
She set, she set, like Titan in his rays. 
No more shall rise or set such glorious Sun, 
Until the heaven’s great revolution: 
If then new things, their old form must retain, 
Eliza shall rule Albian once again. 
 
Her Epitaph. 
Here sleeps T H E Queen, this is the royal bed 
O’ th’ Damask Rose, sprung from the white and red, 
Whose sweet perfume fills the all-filling air, 
This Rose is withered, once so lovely fair: 
On neither tree did grow such Rose before, 
The greater was our gain, our loss the more. 
 
Another. 
Here lies the pride of Queens, pattern of Kings: 
So blaze it fame, here’s feathers for thy wings. 
Here lies the envy’d, yet unparallel’d Prince, 
Whose living virtues speak (though dead long since). 
If many worlds, as that fantastic framed, 
In every one, be her great glory famed.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'History & Politics', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,Prologue,"To sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings, 
Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun, 
For my mean Pen are too superior things; 
Or how they all, or each their dates have run, 
Let Poets and Historians set these forth. 
My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth. 
 
But when my wond’ring eyes and envious heart 
Great Bartas’ sugar’d lines do but read o’er, 
Fool, I do grudge the Muses did not part 
‘Twixt him and me that over-fluent store. 
A Bartas can do what a Bartas will 
But simple I according to my skill. 
 
From School-boy’s tongue no Rhet’ric we expect, 
Nor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings, 
Nor perfect beauty where’s a main defect. 
My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings, 
And this to mend, alas, no Art is able, 
‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable. 
 
Nor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued Greek 
Who lisp’d at first, in future times speak plain. 
By Art he gladly found what he did seek, 
A full requital of his striving pain. 
Art can do much, but this maxim’s most sure: 
A weak or wounded brain admits no cure. 
 
I am obnoxious to each carping tongue 
Who says my hand a needle better fits. 
A Poet’s Pen all scorn I should thus wrong, 
For such despite they cast on female wits. 
If what I do prove well, it won’t advance, 
They’ll say it’s stol’n, or else it was by chance. 
 
But sure the antique Greeks were far more mild, 
Else of our Sex, why feigned they those nine 
And poesy made Calliope’s own child? 
So ‘mongst the rest they placed the Arts divine, 
But this weak knot they will full soon untie. 
The Greeks did nought but play the fools and lie. 
 
Let Greeks be Greeks, and Women what they are. 
Men have precedency and still excel; 
It is but vain unjustly to wage war. 
Men can do best, and Women know it well. 
Preeminence in all and each is yours; 
Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours. 
 
And oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies, 
And ever with your prey still catch your praise, 
If e’er you deign these lowly lines your eyes, 
Give thyme or Parsley wreath, I ask no Bays. 
This mean and unrefined ore of mine 
Will make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Related Audio', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'History & Politics', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,The Author to Her Book,"Thou ill-form’d offspring of my feeble brain, 
Who after birth didst by my side remain, 
Till snatched from thence by friends, less wise than true, 
Who thee abroad, expos’d to publick view, 
Made thee in raggs, halting to th’ press to trudge, 
Where errors were not lessened (all may judg). 
At thy return my blushing was not small, 
My rambling brat (in print) should mother call, 
I cast thee by as one unfit for light, 
Thy Visage was so irksome in my sight; 
Yet being mine own, at length affection would 
Thy blemishes amend, if so I could: 
I wash’d thy face, but more defects I saw, 
And rubbing off a spot, still made a flaw. 
I stretched thy joynts to make thee even feet, 
Yet still thou run’st more hobling then is meet; 
In better dress to trim thee was my mind, 
But nought save home-spun Cloth, i’ th’ house I find. 
In this array ’mongst Vulgars mayst thou roam. 
In Criticks hands, beware thou dost not come; 
And take thy way where yet thou art not known, 
If for thy Father askt, say, thou hadst none: 
And for thy Mother, she alas is poor, 
Which caus’d her thus to send thee out of door.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Related Audio', 'Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Reading & Books', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'Couplet']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,Contemplations,"1 
Sometime now past in the Autumnal Tide, 
When Phoebus wanted but one hour to bed, 
The trees all richly clad, yet void of pride, 
Were gilded o’re by his rich golden head. 
Their leaves and fruits seem’d painted but was true 
Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew, 
Rapt were my senses at this delectable view. 
 
2 
I wist not what to wish, yet sure thought I, 
If so much excellence abide below, 
How excellent is he that dwells on high? 
Whose power and beauty by his works we know. 
Sure he is goodness, wisdom, glory, light, 
That hath this under world so richly dight. 
More Heaven than Earth was here, no winter and no night. 
 
3 
Then on a stately Oak I cast mine Eye, 
Whose ruffling top the Clouds seem’d to aspire; 
How long since thou wast in thine Infancy? 
Thy strength and stature, more thy years admire, 
Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born? 
Or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn, 
If so, all these as nought, Eternity doth scorn. 
 
4 
Then higher on the glistering Sun I gaz’d, 
Whose beams was shaded by the leafy Tree. 
The more I look’d, the more I grew amaz’d 
And softly said, what glory’s like to thee? 
Soul of this world, this Universe’s Eye, 
No wonder some made thee a Deity: 
Had I not better known (alas) the same had I. 
 
5 
Thou as a Bridegroom from thy Chamber rushes 
And as a strong man joys to run a race. 
The morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes. 
The Earth reflects her glances in thy face. 
Birds, insects, Animals with Vegative, 
Thy heat from death and dullness doth revive: 
And in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive. 
 
6 
Thy swift Annual and diurnal Course, 
Thy daily straight and yearly oblique path, 
Thy pleasing fervour, and thy scorching force, 
All mortals here the feeling knowledge hath. 
Thy presence makes it day, thy absence night, 
Quaternal seasons caused by thy might: 
Hail Creature, full of sweetness, beauty, and delight. 
 
7 
Art thou so full of glory that no Eye 
Hath strength thy shining Rays once to behold? 
And is thy splendid Throne erect so high? 
As, to approach it, can no earthly mould. 
How full of glory then must thy Creator be? 
Who gave this bright light luster unto thee: 
Admir’d, ador’d for ever be that Majesty. 
 
8 
Silent alone where none or saw, or heard, 
In pathless paths I lead my wand’ring feet. 
My humble Eyes to lofty Skies I rear’d 
To sing some Song my mazed Muse thought meet. 
My great Creator I would magnifie, 
That nature had thus decked liberally: 
But Ah and Ah again, my imbecility! 
 
9 
I heard the merry grasshopper then sing, 
The black clad Cricket bear a second part. 
They kept one tune and played on the same string, 
Seeming to glory in their little Art. 
Shall creatures abject thus their voices raise? 
And in their kind resound their maker’s praise: 
Whilst I, as mute, can warble forth no higher layes. 
 
10 
When present times look back to Ages past 
And men in being fancy those are dead, 
It makes things gone perpetually to last 
And calls back months and years that long since fled 
It makes a man more aged in conceit, 
Than was Methuselah or’s grand-sire great: 
While of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat. 
 
11 
Sometimes in Eden fair he seems to be, 
See glorious Adam there made Lord of all, 
Fancies the Apple, dangle on the Tree, 
That turn’d his Sovereign to a naked thrall, 
Who like a miscreant’s driven from that place 
To get his bread with pain and sweat of face: 
A penalty impos’d on his backsliding Race. 
 
12 
Here sits our Grandame in retired place, 
And in her lap her bloody Cain new born, 
The weeping Imp oft looks her in the face, 
Bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn; 
His Mother sighs to think of Paradise, 
And how she lost her bliss, to be more wise, 
Believing him that was, and is, Father of lyes. 
 
13 
Here Cain and Abel come to sacrifice, 
Fruits of the Earth and Fatlings each do bring, 
On Abels gift the fire descends from Skies, 
But no such sign on false Cain’s offering; 
With sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes. 
Hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes, 
Upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise. 
 
14 
There Abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks, 
His brother comes, then acts his fratricide. 
The Virgin Earth of blood her first draught drinks, 
But since that time she often hath been cloy’d; 
The wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind, 
Thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind, 
Though none on Earth but kindred near then could he find. 
 
15 
Who fancies not his looks now at the Barr, 
His face like death, his heart with horror fraught, 
Nor Male-factor ever felt like warr, 
When deep despair with wish of life hath fought, 
Branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes, 
A Vagabond to Land of Nod he goes. 
A City builds, that wals might him secure from foes. 
 
16 
Who thinks not oft upon the Fathers ages. 
Their long descent, how nephews sons they saw, 
The starry observations of those Sages, 
And how their precepts to their sons were law, 
How Adam sigh’d to see his Progeny, 
Cloath’d all in his black, sinful Livery, 
Who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly. 
 
17 
Our Life compare we with their length of dayes 
Who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive? 
And though thus short, we shorten many wayes, 
Living so little while we are alive; 
In eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight 
So unawares comes on perpetual night, 
And puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight. 
 
18 
When I behold the heavens as in their prime, 
And then the earth (though old) still clad in green, 
The stones and trees, insensible of time, 
Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen; 
If winter come, and greenness then do fade, 
A Spring returns, and they more youthfull made; 
But Man grows old, lies down, remains where once he’s laid. 
 
19 
By birth more noble than those creatures all, 
Yet seems by nature and by custom curs’d, 
No sooner born, but grief and care makes fall 
That state obliterate he had at first: 
Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again 
Nor habitations long their names retain, 
But in oblivion to the final day remain. 
 
20 
Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth 
Because their beauty and their strength last longer 
Shall I wish there, or never to had birth, 
Because they’re bigger and their bodyes stronger? 
Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye, 
And when unmade, so ever shall they lye, 
But man was made for endless immortality. 
 
21 
Under the cooling shadow of a stately Elm 
Close sate I by a goodly Rivers side, 
Where gliding streams the Rocks did overwhelm; 
A lonely place, with pleasures dignifi’d. 
I once that lov’d the shady woods so well, 
Now thought the rivers did the trees excel, 
And if the sun would ever shine, there would I dwell.

While on the stealing stream I fixt mine eye, 
Which to the long’d-for Ocean held its course, 
I markt, nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye 
Could hinder ought but still augment its force: 
O happy Flood, quoth I, that holds thy race 
Till thou arrive at thy beloved place, 
Nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace. 
 
23 
Nor is’t enough that thou alone may’st slide, 
But hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet, 
So hand in hand along with thee they glide 
To Thetis house, where all imbrace and greet: 
Thou Emblem true of what I count the best, 
O could I lead my Rivolets to rest, 
So may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest. 
 
24 
Ye Fish which in this liquid Region ’bide 
That for each season have your habitation, 
Now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide 
To unknown coasts to give a visitation, 
In Lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry, 
So Nature taught, and yet you know not why, 
You watry folk that know not your felicity. 
 
25 
Look how the wantons frisk to tast the air, 
Then to the colder bottome streight they dive, 
Eftsoon to Neptun’s glassy Hall repair 
To see what trade they, great ones, there do drive, 
Who forrage o’re the spacious sea-green field, 
And take the trembling prey before it yield, 
Whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield. 
 
26 
While musing thus with contemplation fed, 
And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain, 
The sweet-tongu’d Philomel percht ore my head, 
And chanted forth a most melodious strain 
Which rapt me so with wonder and delight, 
I judg’d my hearing better than my sight, 
And wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight. 
 
27 
O merry Bird (said I) that fears no snares, 
That neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn, 
Feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating cares 
To gain more good, or shun what might thee harm 
Thy clothes ne’re wear, thy meat is every where, 
Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer, 
Reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear. 
 
28 
The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent, 
Sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew, 
So each one tunes his pretty instrument, 
And warbling out the old, begin anew, 
And thus they pass their youth in summer season, 
Then follow thee into a better Region, 
Where winter’s never felt by that sweet airy legion. 
 
29 
Man at the best a creature frail and vain, 
In knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak, 
Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain, 
Each storm his state, his mind, his body break, 
From some of these he never finds cessation, 
But day or night, within, without, vexation, 
Troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near’st Relation. 
 
30 
And yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain, 
This lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow, 
This weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain, 
Joys not in hope of an eternal morrow; 
Nor all his losses, crosses and vexation, 
In weight, in frequency and long duration 
Can make him deeply groan for that divine Translation. 
 
31 
The Mariner that on smooth waves doth glide, 
Sings merrily and steers his Barque with ease, 
As if he had command of wind and tide, 
And now becomes great Master of the seas; 
But suddenly a storm spoils all the sport, 
And makes him long for a more quiet port, 
Which ’gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort. 
 
32 
So he that faileth in this world of pleasure, 
Feeding on sweets, that never bit of th’ sowre, 
That’s full of friends, of honour and of treasure, 
Fond fool, he takes this earth ev’n for heav’ns bower, 
But sad affliction comes and makes him see 
Here’s neither honour, wealth, nor safety; 
Only above is found all with security. 
 
33 
O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things, 
That draws oblivions curtains over kings, 
Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not, 
Their names without a Record are forgot, 
Their parts, their ports, their pomp’s all laid in th’ dust. 
Nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust; 
But he whose name is grav’d in the white stone 
Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Growing Old', 'Time & Brevity', 'Nature', 'Fall', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet', 'Imagery']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,"In Reference to her Children, 23 June 1659","I had eight birds hatcht in one nest, 
Four Cocks were there, and Hens the rest. 
I nurst them up with pain and care, 
No cost nor labour did I spare 
Till at the last they felt their wing, 
Mounted the Trees and learned to sing. 
Chief of the Brood then took his flight 
To Regions far and left me quite. 
My mournful chirps I after send 
Till he return, or I do end. 
Leave not thy nest, thy Dame and Sire, 
Fly back and sing amidst this Quire. 
My second bird did take her flight 
And with her mate flew out of sight. 
Southward they both their course did bend, 
And Seasons twain they there did spend, 
Till after blown by Southern gales 
They Norward steer’d with filled sails. 
A prettier bird was no where seen, 
Along the Beach, among the treen. 
I have a third of colour white 
On whom I plac’d no small delight, 
Coupled with mate loving and true, 
Hath also bid her Dame adieu. 
And where Aurora first appears, 
She now hath percht to spend her years. 
One to the Academy flew 
To chat among that learned crew. 
Ambition moves still in his breast 
That he might chant above the rest, 
Striving for more than to do well, 
That nightingales he might excell. 
My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone, 
Is ‘mongst the shrubs and bushes flown 
And as his wings increase in strength 
On higher boughs he’ll perch at length. 
My other three still with me nest 
Until they’re grown, then as the rest, 
Or here or there, they’ll take their flight, 
As is ordain’d, so shall they light. 
If birds could weep, then would my tears 
Let others know what are my fears 
Lest this my brood some harm should catch 
And be surpris’d for want of watch 
Whilst pecking corn and void of care 
They fall un’wares in Fowler’s snare; 
Or whilst on trees they sit and sing 
Some untoward boy at them do fling, 
Or whilst allur’d with bell and glass 
The net be spread and caught, alas; 
Or lest by Lime-twigs they be foil’d; 
Or by some greedy hawks be spoil’d. 
O would, my young, ye saw my breast 
And knew what thoughts there sadly rest. 
Great was my pain when I you bred, 
Great was my care when I you fed. 
Long did I keep you soft and warm 
And with my wings kept off all harm. 
My cares are more, and fears, than ever, 
My throbs such now as ‘fore were never. 
Alas, my birds, you wisdom want 
Of perils you are ignorant. 
Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight, 
Sore accidents on you may light. 
O to your safety have an eye, 
So happy may you live and die. 
Mean while, my days in tunes I’ll spend 
Till my weak lays with me shall end. 
In shady woods I’ll sit and sing 
And things that past, to mind I’ll bring. 
Once young and pleasant, as are you, 
But former toys (no joys) adieu! 
My age I will not once lament 
But sing, my time so near is spent, 
And from the top bough take my flight 
Into a country beyond sight 
Where old ones instantly grow young 
And there with seraphims set song. 
No seasons cold, nor storms they see 
But spring lasts to eternity. 
When each of you shall in your nest 
Among your young ones take your rest, 
In chirping languages oft them tell 
You had a Dame that lov’d you well, 
That did what could be done for young 
And nurst you up till you were strong 
And ‘fore she once would let you fly 
She shew'd you joy and misery, 
Taught what was good, and what was ill, 
What would save life, and what would kill. 
Thus gone, amongst you I may live, 
And dead, yet speak and counsel give. 
Farewell, my birds, farewell, adieu, 
I happy am, if well with you.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Parenthood', 'Time & Brevity', 'Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Weather', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'Couplet']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,To My Dear and Loving Husband,"If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more, we may live ever.

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,Before the Birth of One of Her Children,"All things within this fading world hath end,   
Adversity doth still our joyes attend;

And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains   
Look to my little babes, my dear remains.   
And if thou love thyself, or loved’st me,

of Our house, July 10th. 1666. Copied Out of
a Loose Paper.


In silent night when rest I took,
For sorrow near I did not look,
I wakened was with thund’ring noise
And piteous shrieks of dreadful voice.
That fearful sound of “fire” and “fire,”
Let no man know is my Desire.
I, starting up, the light did spy,
And to my God my heart did cry
To straighten me in my Distress
And not to leave me succourless.
Then, coming out, behold a space
The flame consume my dwelling place.
And when I could no longer look,
I blest His name that gave and took,
That laid my goods now in the dust.
Yea, so it was, and so ‘twas just.
It was his own, it was not mine,
Far be it that I should repine;
He might of all justly bereft
But yet sufficient for us left.
When by the ruins oft I past
My sorrowing eyes aside did cast
And here and there the places spy
Where oft I sate and long did lie.
Here stood that trunk, and there that chest,
There lay that store I counted best.
My pleasant things in ashes lie
And them behold no more shall I.
Under thy roof no guest shall sit,
Nor at thy Table eat a bit.
No pleasant talk shall ‘ere be told
Nor things recounted done of old.
No Candle e'er shall shine in Thee,
Nor bridegroom‘s voice e'er heard shall be.
In silence ever shalt thou lie,
Adieu, Adieu, all’s vanity.
Then straight I ‘gin my heart to chide,
And did thy wealth on earth abide?
Didst fix thy hope on mould'ring dust?
The arm of flesh didst make thy trust?
Raise up thy thoughts above the sky
That dunghill mists away may fly.
Thou hast a house on high erect
Frameed by that mighty Architect,
With glory richly furnished,
Stands permanent though this be fled.
It‘s purchased and paid for too
By Him who hath enough to do.
A price so vast as is unknown,
Yet by His gift is made thine own;
There‘s wealth enough, I need no more,
Farewell, my pelf, farewell, my store.
The world no longer let me love,
My hope and treasure lies above.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Relationships', 'Home Life', 'Couplet']","Source:

Anne Bradstreet,1612–1672,"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess, Queen Elizabeth","Proem. 
Although great Queen, thou now in silence lie, 
Yet thy loud Herald Fame, doth to the sky 
Thy wondrous worth proclaim, in every clime, 
And so has vow’d, whilst there is world or time. 
So great’s thy glory, and thine excellence, 
The sound thereof raps every human sense 
That men account it no impiety 
To say thou wert a fleshly Deity. 
Thousands bring off’rings (though out of date) 
Thy world of honours to accumulate. 
‘Mongst hundred Hecatombs of roaring Verse, 
‘Mine bleating stands before thy royal Hearse. 
Thou never didst, nor canst thou now disdain, 
T’ accept the tribute of a loyal Brain. 
Thy clemency did yerst esteem as much 
The acclamations of the poor, as rich, 
Which makes me deem, my rudeness is no wrong, 
Though I resound thy greatness ‘mongst the throng. 
 
The Poem. 
No Phoenix Pen, nor Spenser’s Poetry, 
No Speed’s, nor Camden’s learned History; 
Eliza’s works, wars, praise, can e’re compact, 
The World’s the Theater where she did act. 
No memories, nor volumes can contain, 
The nine Olymp’ades of her happy reign, 
Who was so good, so just, so learn’d, so wise, 
From all the Kings on earth she won the prize. 
Nor say I more than truly is her due. 
Millions will testify that this is true. 
She hath wip’d off th’ aspersion of her Sex, 
That women wisdom lack to play the Rex. 
Spain’s Monarch sa’s not so, not yet his Host: 
She taught them better manners to their cost. 
The Salic Law had not in force now been, 
If France had ever hop’d for such a Queen. 
But can you Doctors now this point dispute, 
She’s argument enough to make you mute, 
Since first the Sun did run, his ne’er runn’d race, 
And earth had twice a year, a new old face; 
Since time was time, and man unmanly man, 
Come shew me such a Phoenix if you can. 
Was ever people better rul’d than hers? 
Was ever Land more happy, freed from stirs? 
Did ever wealth in England so abound? 
Her Victories in foreign Coasts resound? 
Ships more invincible than Spain’s, her foe 
She rack’t, she sack’d, she sunk his Armadoe. 
Her stately Troops advanc’d to Lisbon’s wall, 
Don Anthony in’s right for to install. 
She frankly help’d Franks’ (brave) distressed King, 
The States united now her fame do sing. 
She their Protectrix was, they well do know, 
Unto our dread Virago, what they owe. 
Her Nobles sacrific’d their noble blood, 
Nor men, nor coin she shap’d, to do them good. 
The rude untamed Irish she did quell, 
And Tiron bound, before her picture fell. 
Had ever Prince such Counsellors as she? 
Her self Minerva caus’d them so to be. 
Such Soldiers, and such Captains never seen, 
As were the subjects of our (Pallas) Queen: 
Her Sea-men through all straits the world did round, 
Terra incognitæ might know her sound. 
Her Drake came laded home with Spanish gold, 
Her Essex took Cadiz, their Herculean hold. 
But time would fail me, so my wit would too, 
To tell of half she did, or she could do. 
Semiramis to her is but obscure; 
More infamy than fame she did procure. 
She plac’d her glory but on Babel’s walls, 
World's wonder for a time, but yet it falls. 
Fierce Tomris (Cirus’ Heads-man, Sythians’ Queen) 
Had put her Harness off, had she but seen 
Our Amazon i’ th’ Camp at Tilbury, 
(Judging all valour, and all Majesty) 
Within that Princess to have residence, 
And prostrate yielded to her Excellence. 
Dido first Foundress of proud Carthage walls 
(Who living consummates her Funerals), 
A great Eliza, but compar’d with ours, 
How vanisheth her glory, wealth, and powers. 
Proud profuse Cleopatra, whose wrong name, 
Instead of glory, prov’d her Country’s shame: 
Of her what worth in Story’s to be seen, 
But that she was a rich Ægyptian Queen. 
Zenobia, potent Empress of the East, 
And of all these without compare the best 
(Whom none but great Aurelius could quell) 
Yet for our Queen is no fit parallel: 
She was a Phoenix Queen, so shall she be, 
Her ashes not reviv’d more Phoenix she. 
Her personal perfections, who would tell, 
Must dip his Pen i’ th’ Heliconian Well, 
Which I may not, my pride doth but aspire 
To read what others write and then admire. 
Now say, have women worth, or have they none? 
Or had they some, but with our Queen is’t gone? 
Nay Masculines, you have thus tax’d us long, 
But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong. 
Let such as say our sex is void of reason 
Know ‘tis a slander now, but once was treason. 
But happy England, which had such a Queen, 
O happy, happy, had those days still been, 
But happiness lies in a higher sphere. 
Then wonder not, Eliza moves not here. 
Full fraught with honour, riches, and with days, 
She set, she set, like Titan in his rays. 
No more shall rise or set such glorious Sun, 
Until the heaven’s great revolution: 
If then new things, their old form must retain, 
Eliza shall rule Albian once again. 
 
Her Epitaph. 
Here sleeps T H E Queen, this is the royal bed 
O’ th’ Damask Rose, sprung from the white and red, 
Whose sweet perfume fills the all-filling air, 
This Rose is withered, once so lovely fair: 
On neither tree did grow such Rose before, 
The greater was our gain, our loss the more. 
 
Another. 
Here lies the pride of Queens, pattern of Kings: 
So blaze it fame, here’s feathers for thy wings. 
Here lies the envy’d, yet unparallel’d Prince, 
Whose living virtues speak (though dead long since). 
If many worlds, as that fantastic framed, 
In every one, be her great glory famed.",elegy,types/modes,"['Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'History & Politics', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

In cream below, in milk-baths higher:

Richard Lovelace,1618–1657,The Snail,"Wise emblem of our politic world,
Sage snail, within thine own self curl’d;
Instruct me softly to make haste,
Whilst these my feet go slowly fast.

     Compendious snail! thou seem’st to me,
Large Euclid’s strict epitome;
And in each diagram dost fling
Thee from the point unto the ring;
A figure now triangular,
An oval now, and now a square;
And then a serpentine dost crawl,
Now a straight line, now crook’d, now all.

     Preventing rival of the day,
Th’art up and openest thy ray,
And ere the morn cradles the moon
Th’art broke into a beauteous noon.
Then when the sun sups in the deep,
Thy silver horns ere Cynthia’s peep;
And thou from thine own liquid bed
New Phoebus heav’st thy pleasant head.

     Who shall a name for thee create,
Deep riddle of mysterious state?
Bold Nature that gives common birth
To all products of seas and earth,
Of thee, as earthquakes, is afraid,
Nor will thy dire deliv’ry aid.

     Thou thine own daughter then, and sire,
That son and mother art entire,
That big still with thy self dost go,
And liv’st an aged embryo;
That like the cubs of India,
Thou from thyself a while dost play;
But frighted with a dog or gun,
In thine own belly thou dost run,
And as thy house was thine own womb,
So thine own womb concludes thy tomb.

     But now I must (analyz’d king)
Thy economic virtues sing;
Thou great stay’d husband still within,
Thou, thee, that’s thine dost discipline;
And when thou art to progress bent,
Thou mov’st thy self and tenement,
As warlike Scythians travell’d, you
Remove your men and city too;
Then after a sad dearth and rain,
Thou scatterest thy silver train;
And when the trees grow nak’d and old,
Thou clothest them with cloth of gold,
Which from thy bowels thou dost spin,
And draw from the rich mines within.

     Now hast thou chang’d thee saint; and made
Thy self a fane that’s cupola’d;
And in thy wreathed cloister thou
Walkest thine own grey friar too;
Strict, and lock’d up, th’art hood all o’er,

 Hovers within my Gates,

 To whisper at the Grates;

 With no allaying Thames,
Our careless heads with Roses bound,
 Our hearts with Loyal Flames;
When thirsty grief in Wine we steep,
 When Healths and draughts go free,
Fishes that tipple in the Deep

 With shriller throat shall sing
The sweetness, Mercy, Majesty,
 And glories of my King;
When I shall voice aloud how good
 He is, how Great should be,

In th’ ocean’s bosom unespy’d,
From a small boat, that row’d along,
The list’ning winds receiv’d this song.

     What should we do but sing his praise
That led us through the wat’ry maze
Unto an isle so long unknown,
And yet far kinder than our own?
Where he the huge sea-monsters wracks,
That lift the deep upon their backs,
He lands us on a grassy stage,
Safe from the storm’s and prelates’ rage.
He gave us this eternal spring
Which here enamels everything,
And sends the fowls to us in care,
On daily visits through the air.
He hangs in shades the orange bright,
Like golden lamps in a green night;
And does in the pomegranates close
Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.
He makes the figs our mouths to meet
And throws the melons at our feet,
But apples plants of such a price,
No tree could ever bear them twice.
With cedars, chosen by his hand,
From Lebanon, he stores the land,
And makes the hollow seas that roar
Proclaim the ambergris on shore.
He cast (of which we rather boast)
The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast,
And in these rocks for us did frame
A temple, where to sound his name.
Oh let our voice his praise exalt,
Till it arrive at heaven’s vault;
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may
Echo beyond the Mexic Bay.

An holy and a cheerful note,

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Character of Holland,"(excerpt)

Holland, that scarce deserves the name of land, 
As but th’ off-scouring of the British sand; 
And so much earth as was contributed 
By English pilots when they heav’d the lead; 
Or what by th’ ocean’s slow alluvion fell, 
Of shipwrack’d cockle and the mussel-shell; 
This indigested vomit of the sea 
Fell to the Dutch by just propriety. 
 
Glad then, as miners that have found the ore, 
They with mad labour fish’d the land to shore; 
And div’d as desperately for each piece 
Of earth, as if’t had been of ambergris; 
Collecting anxiously small loads of clay, 
Less than what building swallows bear away; 
Or than those pills which sordid beetles roll, 
Transfusing into them their dunghill soul. 
 
How did they rivet, with gigantic piles, 
Thorough the centre their new-catched miles; 
And to the stake a struggling country bound, 
Where barking waves still bait the forced ground; 
Building their watry Babel far more high 
To reach the sea, than those to scale the sky. 
 
Yet still his claim the injur’d ocean laid, 
And oft at leap-frog ore their steeples play’d: 
As if on purpose it on land had come 
To show them what’s their mare liberum. 
A daily deluge over them does boil; 
The earth and water play at level-coil; 
The fish oft-times the burgher dispossest, 
And sat not as a meat but as a guest; 
And oft the Tritons and the sea-nymphs saw 
Whole sholes of Dutch serv’d up for cabillau; 
Or as they over the new level rang’d 
For pickled herring, pickled heeren chang’d. 
Nature, it seem’d, asham’d of her mistake, 
Would throw their land away at duck and drake.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44678/the-character-of-holland,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/andrew-marvell,,1621.0,1678.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,A Dialogue between the Soul and the Body,"SOUL 
O who shall, from this dungeon, raise 
A soul enslav’d so many ways? 
With bolts of bones, that fetter’d stands 
In feet, and manacled in hands; 
Here blinded with an eye, and there 
Deaf with the drumming of an ear; 
A soul hung up, as ’twere, in chains 
Of nerves, and arteries, and veins; 
Tortur’d, besides each other part, 
In a vain head, and double heart. 
 
BODY 
O who shall me deliver whole 
From bonds of this tyrannic soul? 
Which, stretch’d upright, impales me so 
That mine own precipice I go; 
And warms and moves this needless frame, 
(A fever could but do the same) 
And, wanting where its spite to try, 
Has made me live to let me die. 
A body that could never rest, 
Since this ill spirit it possest. 
 
SOUL 
What magic could me thus confine 
Within another’s grief to pine? 
Where whatsoever it complain, 
I feel, that cannot feel, the pain; 
And all my care itself employs; 
That to preserve which me destroys; 
Constrain’d not only to endure 
Diseases, but, what’s worse, the cure; 
And ready oft the port to gain, 
Am shipwreck’d into health again. 
 
BODY 
But physic yet could never reach 
The maladies thou me dost teach; 
Whom first the cramp of hope does tear, 
And then the palsy shakes of fear; 
The pestilence of love does heat, 
Or hatred’s hidden ulcer eat; 
Joy’s cheerful madness does perplex, 
Or sorrow’s other madness vex; 
Which knowledge forces me to know, 
And memory will not forego. 
What but a soul could have the wit 
To build me up for sin so fit?

Green trees that in the forest grew.",couplet,stanza forms,"['The Body', 'Nature', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44680/a-dialogue-between-the-soul-and-the-body,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/andrew-marvell,,1621.0,1678.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Garden,"How vainly men themselves amaze
To win the palm, the oak, or bays,
And their uncessant labours see
Crown’d from some single herb or tree,
Whose short and narrow verged shade
Does prudently their toils upbraid;
While all flow’rs and all trees do close
To weave the garlands of repose.

Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,
And Innocence, thy sister dear!
Mistaken long, I sought you then
In busy companies of men;
Your sacred plants, if here below,
Only among the plants will grow.
Society is all but rude,
To this delicious solitude.

No white nor red was ever seen
So am’rous as this lovely green.
Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,
Cut in these trees their mistress’ name;
Little, alas, they know or heed
How far these beauties hers exceed!
Fair trees! wheres’e’er your barks I wound,
No name shall but your own be found.

When we have run our passion’s heat,
Love hither makes his best retreat.
The gods, that mortal beauty chase,
Still in a tree did end their race:
Apollo hunted Daphne so,
Only that she might laurel grow;
And Pan did after Syrinx speed,
Not as a nymph, but for a reed.

What wond’rous life in this I lead!
Ripe apples drop about my head;
The luscious clusters of the vine
Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
The nectarine and curious peach
Into my hands themselves do reach;
Stumbling on melons as I pass,
Ensnar’d with flow’rs, I fall on grass.

Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,
Withdraws into its happiness;
The mind, that ocean where each kind
Does straight its own resemblance find,
Yet it creates, transcending these,
Far other worlds, and other seas;
Annihilating all that’s made
To a green thought in a green shade.

Here at the fountain’s sliding foot,
Or at some fruit tree’s mossy root,
Casting the body’s vest aside,
My soul into the boughs does glide;
There like a bird it sits and sings,
Then whets, and combs its silver wings;
And, till prepar’d for longer flight,
Waves in its plumes the various light.

Such was that happy garden-state,
While man there walk’d without a mate;
After a place so pure and sweet,
 What other help could yet be meet!
But ’twas beyond a mortal’s share
To wander solitary there:
Two paradises ’twere in one
To live in paradise alone.

How well the skillful gard’ner drew
Of flow’rs and herbs this dial new,
Where from above the milder sun
Does through a fragrant zodiac run;
And as it works, th’ industrious bee
Computes its time as well as we.
How could such sweet and wholesome hours
Be reckon’d but with herbs and flow’rs!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'Desire', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Activities', 'Gardening', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44682/the-garden-56d223dec2ced,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/andrew-marvell,,1621.0,1678.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Mower,"Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
     Did after him the world seduce;
And from the fields the flow’rs and plants allure,
     Where nature was most plain and pure.
He first enclos’d within the garden’s square
     A dead and standing pool of air;
And a more luscious earth for them did knead,
     Which stupefied them while it fed.
The pink grew then as double as his mind;
     The nutriment did change the kind.
With strange perfumes he did the roses taint,
     And flow’rs themselves were taught to paint.
The tulip, white, did for complexion seek,
     And learn’d to interline its cheek;
Its onion root they then so high did hold,
     That one was for a meadow sold.
Another world was search’d, through oceans new,
     To find the Marvel of Peru.
And yet these rarities might be allow’d,
     To man, that sov’reign thing and proud;
Had he not dealt between the bark and tree,
     Forbidden mixtures there to see.
No plant now knew the stock from which it came,
     He grafts upon the wild the tame;
That the uncertain and adult’rate fruit
     Might put the palate in dispute.
His green seraglio has its eunuchs too,
     Lest any tyrant him out-do;
And in the cherry he does nature vex,
     To procreate without a sex.
’Tis all enforc’d, the fountain and the grot,
     While the sweet fields do lie forgot;
Where willing nature does to all dispense
     A wild and fragrant innocence;
And fauns and fairies do the meadows till,
     More by their presence than their skill.
Their statues polish’d by some ancient hand,
     May to adorn the gardens stand;
But howso’ere the figures do excel,

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn,"The wanton troopers riding by 
Have shot my fawn, and it will die. 
Ungentle men! they cannot thrive 
To kill thee. Thou ne’er didst alive 
Them any harm, alas, nor could 
Thy death yet do them any good. 
I’m sure I never wish’d them ill, 
Nor do I for all this, nor will; 
But if my simple pray’rs may yet 
Prevail with Heaven to forget 
Thy murder, I will join my tears 
Rather than fail. But oh, my fears! 
It cannot die so. Heaven’s King 
Keeps register of everything, 
And nothing may we use in vain. 
Ev’n beasts must be with justice slain, 
Else men are made their deodands; 
Though they should wash their guilty hands 
In this warm life-blood, which doth part 
From thine, and wound me to the heart, 
Yet could they not be clean, their stain 
Is dyed in such a purple grain. 
There is not such another in 
The world to offer for their sin. 
 
       Unconstant Sylvio, when yet 
I had not found him counterfeit 
One morning (I remember well) 
Tied in this silver chain and bell, 
Gave it to me; nay, and I know 
What he said then; I’m sure I do. 
Said he, “Look how your huntsman here 
Hath taught a fawn to hunt his dear.” 
But Sylvio soon had me beguil’d, 
This waxed tame, while he grew wild; 
And quite regardless of my smart, 
Left me his fawn, but took his heart. 
 
       Thenceforth I set myself to play 
My solitary time away, 
With this, and very well content 
Could so mine idle life have spent; 
For it was full of sport, and light 
Of foot and heart, and did invite 
Me to its game; it seem’d to bless 
Itself in me. How could I less 
Than love it? Oh, I cannot be 
Unkind t’ a beast that loveth me. 
 
       Had it liv’d long, I do not know 
Whether it too might have done so 
As Sylvio did; his gifts might be 
Perhaps as false or more than he. 
But I am sure, for aught that I 
Could in so short a time espy, 
Thy love was far more better then 
The love of false and cruel men. 
 
       With sweetest milk and sugar first 
I it at mine own fingers nurst; 
And as it grew, so every day 
It wax’d more white and sweet than they. 
It had so sweet a breath! And oft 
I blush’d to see its foot more soft 
And white, shall I say than my hand? 
Nay, any lady’s of the land. 
 
       It is a wond’rous thing how fleet 
’Twas on those little silver feet; 
With what a pretty skipping grace 
It oft would challenge me the race; 
And when ’t had left me far away, 
’Twould stay, and run again, and stay, 
For it was nimbler much than hinds, 
And trod, as on the four winds. 
 
       I have a garden of my own, 
But so with roses overgrown 
And lilies, that you would it guess 
To be a little wilderness; 
And all the spring time of the year 
It only loved to be there. 
Among the beds of lilies I 
Have sought it oft, where it should lie; 
Yet could not, till itself would rise, 
Find it, although before mine eyes; 
For, in the flaxen lilies’ shade, 
It like a bank of lilies laid. 
Upon the roses it would feed 
Until its lips ev’n seemed to bleed, 
And then to me ’twould boldly trip 
And print those roses on my lip. 
But all its chief delight was still 
On roses thus itself to fill, 
And its pure virgin limbs to fold 
In whitest sheets of lilies cold. 
Had it liv’d long it would have been 
Lilies without, roses within. 
 
       O help, O help! I see it faint, 
And die as calmly as a saint. 
See how it weeps! The tears do come, 
Sad, slowly dropping like a gum. 
So weeps the wounded balsam, so 
The holy frankincense doth flow; 
The brotherless Heliades 
Melt in such amber tears as these. 
 
       I in a golden vial will 
Keep these two crystal tears, and fill 
It till it do o’erflow with mine, 
Then place it in Diana’s shrine. 
 
       Now my sweet fawn is vanish’d to 
Whither the swans and turtles go, 
In fair Elysium to endure 
With milk-white lambs and ermines pure. 
O do not run too fast, for I 
Will but bespeak thy grave, and die. 
 
       First my unhappy statue shall 
Be cut in marble, and withal 
Let it be weeping too; but there 
Th’ engraver sure his art may spare, 
For I so truly thee bemoan 
That I shall weep though I be stone; 
Until my tears, still dropping, wear 
My breast, themselves engraving there. 
There at my feet shalt thou be laid, 
Of purest alabaster made;

White as I can, though not as thee.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Relationships', 'Pets', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44687/the-nymph-complaining-for-the-death-of-her-fawn,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/andrew-marvell,,1621.0,1678.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,To His Coy Mistress,"Had we but world enough and time, 
This coyness, lady, were no crime. 
We would sit down, and think which way 
To walk, and pass our long love’s day. 
Thou by the Indian Ganges’ side 
Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide 
Of Humber would complain. I would 
Love you ten years before the flood, 
And you should, if you please, refuse 
Till the conversion of the Jews. 
My vegetable love should grow 
Vaster than empires and more slow; 
An hundred years should go to praise 
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze; 
Two hundred to adore each breast, 
But thirty thousand to the rest; 
An age at least to every part, 
And the last age should show your heart. 
For, lady, you deserve this state, 
Nor would I love at lower rate. 
       But at my back I always hear 
Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near; 
And yonder all before us lie 
Deserts of vast eternity. 
Thy beauty shall no more be found; 
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound 
My echoing song; then worms shall try 
That long-preserved virginity, 
And your quaint honour turn to dust, 
And into ashes all my lust; 
The grave’s a fine and private place, 
But none, I think, do there embrace.

Sits on thy skin like morning dew, 
And while thy willing soul transpires 
At every pore with instant fires, 
Now let us sport us while we may, 
And now, like amorous birds of prey, 
Rather at once our time devour 
Than languish in his slow-chapped power. 
Let us roll all our strength and all 
Our sweetness up into one ball, 
And tear our pleasures with rough strife

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,"from Upon Appleton House, to my Lord Fairfax","Within this sober frame expect 
Work of no foreign architect; 
That unto caves the quarries drew, 
And forests did to pastures hew; 
Who of his great design in pain 
Did for a model vault his brain; 
Whose columns should so high be rais’d 
To arch the brows that on them gaz’d. 
 
Why should of all things man unrul’d 
Such unproportion’d dwellings build? 
The beasts are by their dens exprest, 
And birds contrive an equal nest; 
The low roof’d tortoises do dwell 
In cases fit of tortoise-shell; 
No creature loves an empty space; 
Their bodies measure out their place. 
 
But he, superfluously spread, 
Demands more room alive than dead; 
And in his hollow palace goes 
Where winds as he themselves may lose. 
What need of all this marble crust 
T’impark the wanton mote of dust, 
That thinks by breadth the world t’unite 
Though the first builders fail’d in height? 
 
But all things are composed here 
Like nature, orderly and near; 
In which we the dimensions find 
Of that more sober age and mind, 
When larger sized men did stoop 
To enter at a narrow loop; 
As practising, in doors so straight, 
To strain themselves through Heaven’s gate. 
 
And surely when the after age 
Shall hither come in pilgrimage, 
These sacred places to adore, 
By Vere and Fairfax trod before, 
Men will dispute how their extent 
Within such dwarfish confines went; 
And some will smile at this, as well 
As Romulus his bee-like cell. 
 
Humility alone designs 
Those short but admirable lines, 
By which, ungirt and unconstrain’d, 
Things greater are in less contain’d. 
Let others vainly strive t’immure 
The circle in the quadrature! 
These holy mathematics can 
In ev’ry figure equal man. 
 
Yet thus the laden house does sweat, 
And scarce endures the master great, 
But where he comes the swelling hall 
Stirs, and the square grows spherical; 
More by his magnitude distress’d, 
Then he is by its straightness press’d, 
And too officiously it slights 
That in itself which him delights. 
 
So honour better lowness bears, 
Than that unwonted greatness wears; 
Height with a certain grace does bend, 
But low things clownishly ascend. 
And yet what needs there here excuse, 
Where ev’ry thing does answer use? 
Where neatness nothing can condemn, 
Nor pride invent what to contemn? 
 
A stately frontispiece of poor 
Adorns without the open door; 
Nor less the rooms within commends 
Daily new furniture of friends. 
The house was built upon the place 
Only as for a mark of grace; 
And for an inn to entertain 
Its lord a while, but not remain. 
 
Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may, 
Or Billbrough, better hold than they; 
But nature here hath been so free 
As if she said leave this to me. 
Art would more neatly have defac’d

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,Clorinda and Damon,"C. Damon, come drive thy flocks this way. 
D. No, ’tis too late; they went astray. 
C. I have a grassy scutcheon spied,
  Where Flora blazons all her pride. 
  The grass I aim to feast thy sheep: 
  The flowers I for thy temples keep.
D. Grass withers; and the flowers too fade.
C. Seize the short joys then, ere they vade, 
  Seest thou that unfrequented cave?
D. That den?
C.           Love’s Shrine.
D.                         But virtue’s grave. 
C. In whose cool bosom we may lie
  Safe from the sun.
D.                    Not heaven’s eye.
C. Near this, a fountain’s liquid bell 
  Tinkles within the concave shell.
D. Might a soul bathe there and be clean, 
  Or slake its drought?
C.                      What is’t you mean? 
D. These once had been enticing things,
  Clorinda, pastures, caves, and springs.
C. And what late change?
D.                       The other day 
  Pan met me.
C.              What did great Pan say?
D. Words that transcend poor shepherds’ skill,
  But he e’er since my songs does fill:
  And his name swells my slender oat.
C. Sweet must Pan sound in Damon’s note. 
D. Clorinda’s voice might make it sweet. 
C. Who would not in Pan’s praises meet?

CHORUS
Of Pan the flowery pastures sing, 
Caves echo, and the fountains ring.

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,"A Dialogue, between the Resolved Soul and Created Pleasure","Courage, my Soul, now learn to wield 
The weight of thine immortal shield. 
Close on thy head thy helmet bright. 
Balance thy sword against the fight. 
See where an army, strong as fair, 
With silken banners spreads the air. 
Now, if thou be’st that thing divine, 
In this day’s combat let it shine: 
And show that Nature wants an art 
To conquer one resolvèd heart. 
 
PLEASURE 
Welcome the creation’s guest, 
Lord of earth, and heaven’s heir. 
Lay aside that warlike crest, 
And of Nature’s banquet share: 
Where the souls of fruits and flowers 
Stand prepared to heighten yours. 
 
SOUL 
I sup above, and cannot stay 
To bait so long upon the way. 
 
PLEASURE 
On these downy pillows lie, 
Whose soft plumes will thither fly: 
On these roses strewed so plain 
Lest one leaf thy side should strain. 
 
SOUL 
My gentler rest is on a thought, 
Conscious of doing what I ought. 
 
PLEASURE 
If thou be’st with perfumes pleased, 
Such as oft the gods appeased, 
Thou in fragrant clouds shalt show 
Like another god below. 
 
SOUL 
A soul that knows not to presume 
Is heaven’s and its own perfume. 
 
PLEASURE 
Everything does seem to vie 
Which should first attract thine eye: 
But since none deserves that grace, 
In this crystal view thy face. 
 
SOUL 
When the Creator’s skill is prized, 
The rest is all but earth disguised. 
 
PLEASURE 
Hark how music then prepares 
For thy stay these charming airs; 
Which the posting winds recall, 
And suspend the river’s fall. 
 
SOUL 
Had I but any time to lose, 
On this I would it all dispose. 
Cease, tempter. None can chain a mind 
Whom this sweet chordage cannot bind. 
 
CHORUS 
Earth cannot show so brave a sight 
As when a single soul does fence 
The batteries of alluring sense, 
And heaven views it with delight. 
   Then persevere: for still new charges sound: 
   And if thou overcom’st, thou shalt be crowned. 
 
PLEASURE 
All this fair, and soft, and sweet, 
   Which scatteringly doth shine, 
Shall within one beauty meet, 
   And she be only thine. 
 
SOUL 
If things of sight such heavens be, 
What heavens are those we cannot see? 
 
PLEASURE 
Wheresoe’er thy foot shall go 
   The minted gold shall lie, 
Till thou purchase all below, 
   And want new worlds to buy. 
 
SOUL 
Were’t not a price, who’d value gold? 
And that’s worth naught that can be sold. 
 
PLEASURE 
Wilt thou all the glory have 
   That war or peace commend? 
Half the world shall be thy slave 
   The other half thy friend. 
 
SOUL 
What friends, if to my self untrue! 
What slaves, unless I captive you! 
 
PLEASURE 
Thou shalt know each hidden cause; 
   And see the future time: 
Try what depth the centre draws; 
   And then to heaven climb. 
 
SOUL 
None thither mounts by the degree 
Of knowledge, but humility. 
 
CHORUS 
Triumph, triumph, victorious Soul; 
The world has not one pleasure more: 
The rest does lie beyond the Pole, 
And is thine everlasting store.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Mixed']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Gallery,"Clora, come view my soul, and tell   
Whether I have contrived it well.   
Now all its several lodgings lie   
Composed into one gallery; 
And the great arras-hangings, made   
Of various faces, by are laid;   
That, for all furniture, you’ll find   
Only your picture in my mind. 
 
Here thou are painted in the dress 
Of an inhuman murderess;   
Examining upon our hearts   
Thy fertile shop of cruel arts:   
Engines more keen than ever yet   
Adorned a tyrant’s cabinet; 
Of which the most tormenting are 
Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair. 
 
But, on the other side, th’art drawn   
Like to Aurora in the dawn; 
When in the East she slumbering lies,   
And stretches out her milky thighs;   
While all the morning choir does sing,   
And manna falls, and roses spring;   
And, at thy feet, the wooing doves   
Sit pérfecting their harmless loves. 
 
Like an enchantress here thou show’st,   
Vexing thy restless lover’s ghost;   
And, by a light obscure, dost rave   
Over his entrails, in the cave;   
Divining thence, with horrid care,   
How long thou shalt continue fair; 
And (when informed) them throw’st away, 
To be the greedy vulture’s prey. 
 
But, against that, thou sit’st afloat   
Like Venus in her pearly boat. 
The halcyons, calming all that’s nigh,   
Betwixt the air and water fly;   
Or, if some rolling wave appears,   
A mass of ambergris it bears. 
Nor blows more wind than what may well   
Convoy the perfume to the smell. 
 
These pictures and a thousand more 
Of thee my gallery do store 
In all the forms thou canst invent   
Either to please me, or torment:   
For thou alone to people me,   
Art grown a numerous colony;   
And a collection choicer far 
Than or Whitehall’s or Mantua’s were. 
 
But, of these pictures and the rest, 
That at the entrance likes me best:   
Where the same posture, and the look   
Remains, with which I first was took:   
A tender shepherdess, whose hair 
Hangs loosely playing in the air,   
Transplanting flowers from the green hill,   
To crown her head, and bosom fill.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Painting & Sculpture', 'Couplet', 'Ekphrasis']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Unfortunate Lover,"Alas, how pleasant are their days 
With whom the infant Love yet plays! 
Sorted by pairs, they still are seen 
By fountains cool, and shadows green. 
But soon these flames do lose their light, 
Like meteors of a summer’s night: 
Nor can they to that region climb, 
To make impression upon time.

’Twas in a shipwreck, when the seas 
Ruled, and the winds did what they please, 
That my poor lover floating lay,
And, ere brought forth, was cast away: 
Till at the last the master-wave
Upon the rock his mother drave;
And there she split against the stone, 
In a Caesarean sectión.

The sea him lent those bitter tears
Which at his eyes he always wears;
And from the winds the sighs he bore, 
Which through his surging breast do roar. 
No day he saw but that which breaks 
Through frighted clouds in forkèd streaks, 
While round the rattling thunder hurled, 
As at the funeral of the world.

While Nature to his birth presents 
This masque of quarrelling elements,
A numerous fleet of cormorants black,
That sailed insulting o’er the wrack, 
Received into their cruel care 
Th’ unfortunate and abject heir: 
Guardians most fit to entertain 
The orphan of the hurricane.

They fed him up with hopes and air, 
Which soon digested to despair, 
And as one cormorant fed him, still 
Another on his heart did bill,
Thus while they famish him, and feast, 
He both consumèd, and increased: 
And languishèd with doubtful breath, 
The amphibíum of life and death.

And now, when angry heaven would
Behold a spectacle of blood, 
Fortune and he are called to play 
At sharp before it all the day:
And tyrant Love his breast does ply
With all his winged artillery,
Whilst he, betwixt the flames and waves, 
Like Ajax, the mad tempest braves.

See how he nak’d and fierce does stand, 
Cuffing the thunder with one hand,
While with the other he does lock,
And grapple, with the stubborn rock: 
From which he with each wave rebounds, 
Torn into flames, and ragg’d with wounds, 
And all he ’says, a lover dressed
In his own blood does relish best.

This is the only banneret 
That ever Love created yet:
Who though, by the malignant stars,
Forcèd to live in storms and wars, 
Yet dying leaves a perfume here, 
And music within every ear: 
And he in story only rules, 
In a field sable a lover gules.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Love', 'Break-ups & Vexed Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Couplet']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,Upon the Hill and Grove at Bilbrough,"TO THE LORD FAIRFAX

See how the archèd earth does here 
Rise in a perfect hemisphere!
The stiffest compass could not strike 
A line more circular and like; 
Nor softest pencil draw a brow 
So equal as this hill does bow. 
It seems as for a model laid, 
And that the world by it was made.

Here learn, ye mountains more unjust, 
Which to abrupter greatness thrust,
That do with your hook-shouldered height 
The earth deform and heaven fright, 
For whose excrescence, ill-designed, 
Nature must a new centre find,
Learn here those humble steps to tread, 
Which to securer glory lead.

See what a soft access and wide 
Lies open to its grassy side;
Nor with the rugged path deters 
The feet of breathless travellers. 
See then how courteous it ascends, 
And all the way it rises bends; 
Nor for itself the height does gain, 
But only strives to raise the plain.

Yet thus it all the field commands,
And in unenvied greatness stands, 
Discerning further than the cliff 
Of heaven-daring Tenerife.
How glad the weary seamen haste 
When they salute it from the mast! 
By night the Northern Star their way 
Directs, and this no less by day.

Upon its crest this mountain grave
A plump of agèd trees does wave. 
No hostile hand durst ere invade 
With impious steel the sacred shade. 
For something always did appear 
Of the great Master’s terror there: 
And men could hear his armour still 
Rattling through all the grove and hill. 

Fear of the Master, and respect
Of the great Nymph, did it protect, 
Vera the Nymph that him inspired, 
To whom he often here retired,
And on these oaks engraved her name; 
Such wounds alone these woods became: 
But ere he well the barks could part 
’Twas writ already in their heart.

For they (’tis credible) have sense,
As we, of love and reverence,
And underneath the coarser rind
The genius of the house do bind. 
Hence they successes seem to know, 
And in their Lord’s advancement grow;
But in no memory were seen,
As under this, so straight and green;

Yet now no further strive to shoot, 
Contented if they fix their root. 
Nor to the wind’s uncertain gust, 
Their prudent heads too far intrust. 
Only sometimes a fluttering breeze 
Discourses with the breathing trees, 
Which in their modest whispers name 
Those acts that swelled the cheek of fame.

‘Much other groves’, say they, ‘than these 
And other hills him once did please. 
Through groves of pikes he thundered then, 
And mountains raised of dying men. 
For all the civic garlands due
To him, our branches are but few. 
Nor are our trunks enow to bear 
The trophies of one fertile year.’

’Tis true, ye trees, nor ever spoke 
More certain oracles in oak.
But peace, (if you his favour prize): 
That courage its own praises flies. 
Therefore to your obscurer seats 
From his own brightness he retreats: 
Nor he the hills without the groves, 
Nor height, but with retirement, loves.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Couplet']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Mower against Gardens,"Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
 Did after him the world seduce,
And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,
 Where nature was most plain and pure. 
He first enclosed within the gardens square
 A dead and standing pool of air,
And a more luscious earth for them did knead, 
 Which stupified them while it fed.
The pink grew then as double as his mind; 
 The nutriment did change the kind.
With strange perfumes he did the roses taint,
 And flowers themselves were taught to paint. 
The tulip, white, did for complexion seek,
 And learned to interline its cheek:
Its onion root they then so high did hold, 
 That one was for a meadow sold.
Another world was searched, through oceans new, 
 To find the Marvel of Peru.
And yet these rarities might be allowed
 To man, that sovereign thing and proud, 
Had he not dealt between the bark and tree, 
 Forbidden mixtures there to see.
No plant now knew the stock from which it came; 
 He grafts upon the wild the tame:
That th’ uncertain and adulterate fruit
 Might put the palate in dispute.
His green seraglio has its eunuchs too,
 Lest any tyrant him outdo.
And in the cherry he does nature vex,
 To procreate without a sex.
’Tis all enforced, the fountain and the grot, 
 While the sweet fields do lie forgot:
Where willing nature does to all dispense
 A wild and fragrant innocence:
And fauns and fairies do the meadows till,
 More by their presence than their skill.
Their statues, polished by some ancient hand,
 May to adorn the gardens stand: 
But howsoe’er the figures do excel,
 The gods themselves with us do dwell.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Gardening', 'Jobs & Working', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,Damon the Mower,"Hark how the Mower Damon sung, 
With love of Juliana stung! 
While everything did seem to paint 
The scene more fit for his complaint. 
Like her fair eyes the day was fair, 
But scorching like his am’rous care. 
Sharp like his scythe his sorrow was, 
And withered like his hopes the grass. 
 
‘Oh what unusual heats are here, 
Which thus our sunburned meadows sear! 
The grasshopper its pipe gives o’er; 
And hamstringed frogs can dance no more. 
But in the brook the green frog wades; 
And grasshoppers seek out the shades. 
Only the snake, that kept within, 
Now glitters in its second skin. 
 
‘This heat the sun could never raise, 
Nor Dog Star so inflame the days. 
It from an higher beauty grow’th, 
Which burns the fields and mower both: 
Which mads the dog, and makes the sun 
Hotter than his own Phaëton. 
Not July causeth these extremes, 
But Juliana’s scorching beams. 
 
‘Tell me where I may pass the fires 
Of the hot day, or hot desires. 
To what cool cave shall I descend, 
Or to what gelid fountain bend? 
Alas! I look for ease in vain, 
When remedies themselves complain. 
No moisture but my tears do rest, 
Nor cold but in her icy breast. 
 
‘How long wilt thou, fair shepherdess, 
Esteem me, and my presents less? 
To thee the harmless snake I bring, 
Disarmèd of its teeth and sting; 
To thee chameleons, changing hue, 
And oak leaves tipped with honey dew. 
Yet thou, ungrateful, hast not sought 
Nor what they are, nor who them brought. 
 
‘I am the Mower Damon, known 
Through all the meadows I have mown. 
On me the morn her dew distills 
Before her darling daffodils. 
And, if at noon my toil me heat, 
The sun himself licks off my sweat. 
While, going home, the evening sweet 
In cowslip-water bathes my feet. 
 
‘What, though the piping shepherd stock 
The plains with an unnumbered flock, 
This scythe of mine discovers wide 
More ground than all his sheep do hide. 
With this the golden fleece I shear 
Of all these closes every year. 
And though in wool more poor than they, 
Yet am I richer far in hay. 
 
‘Nor am I so deformed to sight, 
If in my scythe I lookèd right; 
In which I see my picture done, 
As in a crescent moon the sun. 
The deathless fairies take me oft 
To lead them in their dances soft: 
And, when I tune myself to sing, 
About me they contract their ring. 
 
‘How happy might I still have mowed, 
Had not Love here his thistles sowed! 
But now I all the day complain, 
Joining my labour to my pain; 
And with my scythe cut down the grass, 
Yet still my grief is where it was: 
But, when the iron blunter grows, 
Sighing, I whet my scythe and woes.’ 
 
While thus he threw his elbow round, 
Depopulating all the ground, 
And, with his whistling scythe, does cut 
Each stroke between the earth and root, 
The edgèd steel by careless chance 
Did into his own ankle glance; 
And there among the grass fell down, 
By his own scythe, the Mower mown. 
 
‘Alas!’ said he, ‘these hurts are slight 
To those that die by love’s despite. 
With shepherd’s-purse, and clown’s-all-heal, 
The blood I staunch, and wound I seal. 
Only for him no cure is found, 
Whom Juliana’s eyes do wound.

For Death thou art a Mower too.’",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Unrequited Love', 'Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']","Source:

There’s no wolf, no fox, no bear. 
No need of dog to fetch our stray, 
Our Lightfoot we may give away; 
No oat-pipe’s needful; there thy ears 
May sleep with music of the spheres. 
 
DORINDA 
Oh sweet! Oh sweet! How I my future state 
By silent thinking antedate: 
I prithee let us spend our time to come 
In talking of Elysium. 
 
THYRSIS 
Then I’ll go on. There sheep are full 
Of sweetest grass and softest wool; 
There birds sing consorts, garlands grow, 
Cool winds do whisper, springs do flow. 
There always is a rising sun, 
And day is ever but begun. 
Shepherds there bear equal sway, 
And every nymph’s a Queen of May. 
 
DORINDA 
Ah me, ah me! 
 
 
THYRSIS 
                        Dorinda, why dost cry? 
 
DORINDA 
I’m sick, I’m sick, and fain would die. 
Convince me now that this is true 
By bidding with me all adieu. 
 
THYRSIS 
I cannot live without thee, I, 
I’ll for thee, much more with thee, die. 
 
CHORUS 
Then let us give Corillo charge o’ the sheep, 
And thou and I’ll pick poppies, and them steep 
In wine, and drink on’t even till we weep, 
So shall we smoothly pass away in sleep.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,Clorinda and Damon,"C. Damon, come drive thy flocks this way. 
D. No, ’tis too late; they went astray. 
C. I have a grassy scutcheon spied,
  Where Flora blazons all her pride. 
  The grass I aim to feast thy sheep: 
  The flowers I for thy temples keep.
D. Grass withers; and the flowers too fade.
C. Seize the short joys then, ere they vade, 
  Seest thou that unfrequented cave?
D. That den?
C.           Love’s Shrine.
D.                         But virtue’s grave. 
C. In whose cool bosom we may lie
  Safe from the sun.
D.                    Not heaven’s eye.
C. Near this, a fountain’s liquid bell 
  Tinkles within the concave shell.
D. Might a soul bathe there and be clean, 
  Or slake its drought?
C.                      What is’t you mean? 
D. These once had been enticing things,
  Clorinda, pastures, caves, and springs.
C. And what late change?
D.                       The other day 
  Pan met me.
C.              What did great Pan say?
D. Words that transcend poor shepherds’ skill,
  But he e’er since my songs does fill:
  And his name swells my slender oat.
C. Sweet must Pan sound in Damon’s note. 
D. Clorinda’s voice might make it sweet. 
C. Who would not in Pan’s praises meet?

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Picture of Little T. C. in a Prospect of Flowers,"See with what simplicity
This nymph begins her golden days! 
In the green grass she loves to lie, 
And there with her fair aspect tames
The wilder flowers, and gives them names: 
But only with the roses plays;
                 And them does tell
What colour best becomes them, and what smell.

Who can foretell for what high cause 
This Darling of the Gods was born! 
Yet this is she whose chaster laws 
The wanton Love shall one day fear, 
And, under her command severe, 
See his bow broke and ensigns torn.
                 Happy, who can 
Appease this virtuous enemy of man!

O, then let me in time compound,
And parley with those conquering eyes; 
Ere they have tried their force to wound, 
Ere, with their glancing wheels, they drive
In triumph over hearts that strive,
And them that yield but more despise. 
                 Let me be laid,
Where I may see thy glories from some shade.

Meantime, whilst every verdant thing 
Itself does at thy beauty charm, 
Reform the errors of the spring; 
Make that the tulips may have share 
Of sweetness, seeing they are fair; 
And roses of their thorns disarm:
                 But most procure 
That violets may a longer age endure.

But, O young beauty of the woods,
Whom Nature courts with fruits and flowers, 
Gather the flowers, but spare the buds; 
Lest Flora angry at thy crime, 
To kill her infants in their prime, 
Do quickly make the example yours;
                 And, ere we see,
Nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Living', 'Infancy', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Philosophy', 'Pastoral', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Mower against Gardens,"Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
 Did after him the world seduce,
And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,
 Where nature was most plain and pure. 
He first enclosed within the gardens square
 A dead and standing pool of air,
And a more luscious earth for them did knead, 
 Which stupified them while it fed.
The pink grew then as double as his mind; 
 The nutriment did change the kind.
With strange perfumes he did the roses taint,
 And flowers themselves were taught to paint. 
The tulip, white, did for complexion seek,
 And learned to interline its cheek:
Its onion root they then so high did hold, 
 That one was for a meadow sold.
Another world was searched, through oceans new, 
 To find the Marvel of Peru.
And yet these rarities might be allowed
 To man, that sovereign thing and proud, 
Had he not dealt between the bark and tree, 
 Forbidden mixtures there to see.
No plant now knew the stock from which it came; 
 He grafts upon the wild the tame:
That th’ uncertain and adulterate fruit
 Might put the palate in dispute.
His green seraglio has its eunuchs too,
 Lest any tyrant him outdo.
And in the cherry he does nature vex,
 To procreate without a sex.
’Tis all enforced, the fountain and the grot, 
 While the sweet fields do lie forgot:
Where willing nature does to all dispense
 A wild and fragrant innocence:
And fauns and fairies do the meadows till,
 More by their presence than their skill.
Their statues, polished by some ancient hand,
 May to adorn the gardens stand: 
But howsoe’er the figures do excel,
 The gods themselves with us do dwell.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Activities', 'Gardening', 'Jobs & Working', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,Damon the Mower,"Hark how the Mower Damon sung, 
With love of Juliana stung! 
While everything did seem to paint 
The scene more fit for his complaint. 
Like her fair eyes the day was fair, 
But scorching like his am’rous care. 
Sharp like his scythe his sorrow was, 
And withered like his hopes the grass. 
 
‘Oh what unusual heats are here, 
Which thus our sunburned meadows sear! 
The grasshopper its pipe gives o’er; 
And hamstringed frogs can dance no more. 
But in the brook the green frog wades; 
And grasshoppers seek out the shades. 
Only the snake, that kept within, 
Now glitters in its second skin. 
 
‘This heat the sun could never raise, 
Nor Dog Star so inflame the days. 
It from an higher beauty grow’th, 
Which burns the fields and mower both: 
Which mads the dog, and makes the sun 
Hotter than his own Phaëton. 
Not July causeth these extremes, 
But Juliana’s scorching beams. 
 
‘Tell me where I may pass the fires 
Of the hot day, or hot desires. 
To what cool cave shall I descend, 
Or to what gelid fountain bend? 
Alas! I look for ease in vain, 
When remedies themselves complain. 
No moisture but my tears do rest, 
Nor cold but in her icy breast. 
 
‘How long wilt thou, fair shepherdess, 
Esteem me, and my presents less? 
To thee the harmless snake I bring, 
Disarmèd of its teeth and sting; 
To thee chameleons, changing hue, 
And oak leaves tipped with honey dew. 
Yet thou, ungrateful, hast not sought 
Nor what they are, nor who them brought. 
 
‘I am the Mower Damon, known 
Through all the meadows I have mown. 
On me the morn her dew distills 
Before her darling daffodils. 
And, if at noon my toil me heat, 
The sun himself licks off my sweat. 
While, going home, the evening sweet 
In cowslip-water bathes my feet. 
 
‘What, though the piping shepherd stock 
The plains with an unnumbered flock, 
This scythe of mine discovers wide 
More ground than all his sheep do hide. 
With this the golden fleece I shear 
Of all these closes every year. 
And though in wool more poor than they, 
Yet am I richer far in hay. 
 
‘Nor am I so deformed to sight, 
If in my scythe I lookèd right; 
In which I see my picture done, 
As in a crescent moon the sun. 
The deathless fairies take me oft 
To lead them in their dances soft: 
And, when I tune myself to sing, 
About me they contract their ring. 
 
‘How happy might I still have mowed, 
Had not Love here his thistles sowed! 
But now I all the day complain, 
Joining my labour to my pain; 
And with my scythe cut down the grass, 
Yet still my grief is where it was: 
But, when the iron blunter grows, 
Sighing, I whet my scythe and woes.’ 
 
While thus he threw his elbow round, 
Depopulating all the ground, 
And, with his whistling scythe, does cut 
Each stroke between the earth and root, 
The edgèd steel by careless chance 
Did into his own ankle glance; 
And there among the grass fell down, 
By his own scythe, the Mower mown. 
 
‘Alas!’ said he, ‘these hurts are slight 
To those that die by love’s despite. 
With shepherd’s-purse, and clown’s-all-heal, 
The blood I staunch, and wound I seal. 
Only for him no cure is found, 
Whom Juliana’s eyes do wound. 
’Tis death alone that this must do: 
For Death thou art a Mower too.’",pastoral,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Unrequited Love', 'Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']","Source:

Andrew Marvell,1621–1678,The Gallery,"Clora, come view my soul, and tell   
Whether I have contrived it well.   
Now all its several lodgings lie   
Composed into one gallery; 
And the great arras-hangings, made   
Of various faces, by are laid;   
That, for all furniture, you’ll find   
Only your picture in my mind. 
 
Here thou are painted in the dress 
Of an inhuman murderess;   
Examining upon our hearts   
Thy fertile shop of cruel arts:   
Engines more keen than ever yet   
Adorned a tyrant’s cabinet; 
Of which the most tormenting are 
Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair. 
 
But, on the other side, th’art drawn   
Like to Aurora in the dawn; 
When in the East she slumbering lies,   
And stretches out her milky thighs;   
While all the morning choir does sing,   
And manna falls, and roses spring;   
And, at thy feet, the wooing doves   
Sit pérfecting their harmless loves. 
 
Like an enchantress here thou show’st,   
Vexing thy restless lover’s ghost;   
And, by a light obscure, dost rave   
Over his entrails, in the cave;   
Divining thence, with horrid care,   
How long thou shalt continue fair; 
And (when informed) them throw’st away, 
To be the greedy vulture’s prey. 
 
But, against that, thou sit’st afloat   
Like Venus in her pearly boat. 
The halcyons, calming all that’s nigh,   
Betwixt the air and water fly;   
Or, if some rolling wave appears,   
A mass of ambergris it bears. 
Nor blows more wind than what may well   
Convoy the perfume to the smell. 
 
These pictures and a thousand more 
Of thee my gallery do store 
In all the forms thou canst invent   
Either to please me, or torment:   
For thou alone to people me,   
Art grown a numerous colony;   
And a collection choicer far 
Than or Whitehall’s or Mantua’s were. 
 
But, of these pictures and the rest, 
That at the entrance likes me best:   
Where the same posture, and the look   
Remains, with which I first was took:   
A tender shepherdess, whose hair 
Hangs loosely playing in the air,   
Transplanting flowers from the green hill,   
To crown her head, and bosom fill.",ekphrasis,types/modes,"['Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Painting & Sculpture', 'Couplet', 'Ekphrasis']","Source:

Shined in my angel infancy. 
Before I understood this place 
Appointed for my second race, 
Or taught my soul to fancy aught 
But a white, celestial thought; 
When yet I had not walked above 
A mile or two from my first love, 
And looking back, at that short space, 
Could see a glimpse of His bright face; 
When on some gilded cloud or flower 
My gazing soul would dwell an hour, 
And in those weaker glories spy 
Some shadows of eternity; 
Before I taught my tongue to wound 
My conscience with a sinful sound, 
Or had the black art to dispense 
A several sin to every sense, 
But felt through all this fleshly dress 
Bright shoots of everlastingness. 
       O, how I long to travel back, 
And tread again that ancient track! 
That I might once more reach that plain 
Where first I left my glorious train, 
From whence th’ enlightened spirit sees 
That shady city of palm trees. 
But, ah! my soul with too much stay 
Is drunk, and staggers in the way.

Henry Vaughan,1621–1695,The World,"I saw Eternity the other night,
Like a great ring of pure and endless light,
    All calm, as it was bright;
And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,
    Driv’n by the spheres
Like a vast shadow mov’d; in which the world
    And all her train were hurl’d.
The doting lover in his quaintest strain
    Did there complain;
Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,
    Wit’s sour delights,
With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,
    Yet his dear treasure
All scatter’d lay, while he his eyes did pour
    Upon a flow’r.

The darksome statesman hung with weights and woe,
Like a thick midnight-fog mov’d there so slow,
    He did not stay, nor go;
Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl
    Upon his soul,
And clouds of crying witnesses without
    Pursued him with one shout.
Yet digg’d the mole, and lest his ways be found,
    Work’d under ground,
Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see
    That policy;
Churches and altars fed him; perjuries
    Were gnats and flies;
It rain’d about him blood and tears, but he
    Drank them as free.

The fearful miser on a heap of rust
Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust
    His own hands with the dust,
Yet would not place one piece above, but lives
    In fear of thieves;
Thousands there were as frantic as himself,
    And hugg’d each one his pelf;
The downright epicure plac’d heav’n in sense,
    And scorn’d pretence,
While others, slipp’d into a wide excess,
    Said little less;
The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,
    Who think them brave;
And poor despised Truth sate counting by
    Their victory.

Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,
And sing, and weep, soar’d up into the ring;
    But most would use no wing.
O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night
    Before true light,
To live in grots and caves, and hate the day
    Because it shews the way,
The way, which from this dead and dark abode
    Leads up to God,
A way where you might tread the sun, and be
    More bright than he.
But as I did their madness so discuss
    One whisper’d thus,
“This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,
    But for his bride.”",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Time & Brevity', 'Nature', 'Stars, Planets, Heavens', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45434/the-world-56d2250cca80d,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-vaughan,,1621.0,1695.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Henry Vaughan,1621–1695,The Water-fall,"With what deep murmurs through time’s silent stealth
Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat’ry wealth
Here flowing fall,
And chide, and call,
As if his liquid, loose retinue stay’d
Ling’ring, and were of this steep place afraid;
The common pass
Where, clear as glass,
All must descend
Not to an end,
But quicken’d by this deep and rocky grave,
Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.

Dear stream! dear bank, where often I
Have sate and pleas’d my pensive eye,
Why, since each drop of thy quick store
Runs thither whence it flow’d before,
Should poor souls fear a shade or night,
Who came, sure, from a sea of light?
Or since those drops are all sent back
So sure to thee, that none doth lack,
Why should frail flesh doubt any more
That what God takes, he’ll not restore?

O useful element and clear!
My sacred wash and cleanser here,
My first consigner unto those
Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!
What sublime truths and wholesome themes
Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!
Such as dull man can never find

Which first upon thy face did move,
And hatch’d all with his quick’ning love.

In streaming rings restagnates all,

John Bunyan,1628–1688,Upon the Disobedient Child,"LXVI. Upon the Disobedient Child.
Children become, while little, our delights,
When they grow bigger, they begin to fright's.
Their sinful Nature prompts them to rebel,
And to delight in Paths that lead to Hell.
Their Parents Love, and Care, they overlook,
As if Relation had them quite forsook.
They take the Counsels of the Wanton's rather,
Then the most grave Instructions of a Father.
They reckon Parents ought to do for them,
Tho they the Fifth Commandement contemn.
They snap, and snarl, if Parents them controul,
Tho but in things, most hurtful to the Soul.
They reckon they are Masters, and that we,
Who Parents are, should to them Subject be!
If Parents fain would have a hand in chusing,
The Children have a heart will in refusing.
They'l by wrong doings, under Parents, gather
And say, it is no Sin to rob a Father,
They'l jostle Parents out of place and Pow'r,
They'l make themselves the Head, and them devour.
How many Children, by becoming Head,
Have brought their Parents to a peice of Bread!
Thus they who at the first were Parents Joy,
Turn that to Bitterness, themselves destroy.
    But Wretched Child, how canst thou thus requite
Thy Aged Parents, for that great delight
They took in thee, when thou, as helpless lay
In their Indulgent Bosoms day by day?
Thy Mother, long before she brought thee forth,
Took care thou should'st want, neither Food, nor Cloth.
Thy Father glad was at his very heart,
Had he, to thee, a Portion to impart.
Comfort they promised themselves in thee,
But thou, it seems, to them a Grief wil't be.
How oft! How willingly brake they their Sleep,
If thou, their Bantling, didst but whinch or weep.
Their Love to thee was such, they could have giv'n,
That thou might'st live, almost, their part of Heav'n.
    But now, behold, how they rewarded are!
For their Indulgent Love, and tender Care,
All is forgot, this Love he doth despise,
They brought this Bird up to pick out their Eyes.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Parenthood', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43786/upon-the-disobedient-child,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-bunyan,,1628.0,1688.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Bunyan,1628–1688,Upon the Vine-tree,"XLV. Upon the Vine-tree.
What is the Vine, more than another Tree,
Nay most, than it, more tall, more comly be?
What Work-man thence will take a Beam or Pin,
To make ought which may be delighted in?
It's Excellency in it's Fruit doth lie.
A fruitless Vine! It is not worth a Fly.

Comparison.
What are Professors more than other men?
Nothing at all. Nay, there's not one in ten,
Either for Wealth, or Wit, that may compare,
In many things, with some that Carnal are.
Good are they, if they mortifie their Sin;
But without that they are not worth a Pin.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Gardening', 'School & Learning', 'Nature', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Couplet', 'Metaphor', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43788/upon-the-vine-tree,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-bunyan,,1628.0,1688.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Katherine Philips,1631–1664,Epitaph,"On her Son H.P. at St. Syth’s Church where her body also lies interred

What on Earth deserves our trust?
Youth and Beauty both are dust.
Long we gathering are with pain,
What one moment calls again.
Seven years childless marriage past,
A Son, a son is born at last:
So exactly lim’d and fair,
Full of good Spirits, Meen, and Air,
As a long life promised,
Yet, in less than six weeks dead.
Too promising, too great a mind
In so small room to be confined:
Therefore, as fit in Heaven to dwell,
He quickly broke the Prison shell.
So the subtle Alchemist,
Can’t with Hermes Seal resist

But t’will bid him long good night.

John Dryden,1631–1700,Absalom and Achitophel,"In pious times, ere priest-craft did begin,
Before polygamy was made a sin;
When man, on many, multipli'd his kind,
Ere one to one was cursedly confin'd:
When Nature prompted, and no Law deni'd
Promiscuous use of concubine and bride;
Then, Israel's monarch, after Heaven's own heart,
His vigorous warmth did variously impart
To wives and slaves: and, wide as his command,
Scatter'd his Maker's image through the land.
Michal, of royal blood, the crown did wear;
A soil ungrateful to the tiller's care:
Not so the rest; for several mothers bore
To god-like David, several sons before.
But since like slaves his bed they did ascend,
No true succession could their seed attend.
Of all this numerous progeny was none
So beautiful, so brave, as Absalom:
Whether, inspir'd by some diviner lust,
His father got him with a greater gust;
Or that his conscious destiny made way,
By manly beauty to imperial sway.
Early in foreign fields he won renown,
With kings and states alli'd to Israel's crown:
In peace the thoughts of war he could remove,
And seem'd as he were only born for love.
Whate'er he did, was done with so much ease,
In him alone, 'twas natural to please:
His motions all accompani'd with grace;
And Paradise was open'd in his face.
With secret joy, indulgent David view'd
His youthful image in his son renew'd:
To all his wishes nothing he deni'd;
And made the charming Annabel his bride.
What faults he had (for who from faults is free?)
His father could not, or he would not see.
Some warm excesses, which the Law forbore,
Were constru'd youth that purged by boiling o'er:
And Amnon's murther, by a specious name,
Was call'd a just revenge for injur'd fame.
Thus prais'd, and lov'd, the noble youth remain'd,
While David, undisturb'd, in Sion reign'd.
But life can never be sincerely blest:
Heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best.
The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murm'ring race,
As ever tri'd th'extent and stretch of grace;
God's pamper'd people whom, debauch'd with ease,
No king could govern, nor no God could please;
(Gods they had tri'd of every shape and size,
That god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:)
These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,
Began to dream they wanted liberty:
And when no rule, no precedent, was found
Of men, by laws less circumscrib'd and bound,
They led their wild desires to woods and caves,
And thought that all but savages were slaves.
They who, when Saul was dead, without a blow,
Made foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego;
Who banisht David did from Hebron bring,
And, with a general shout, proclaim'd him king:
Those very Jews, who, at their very best,
Their Humour more than loyalty exprest,
Now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'd
An idol-monarch which their hands had made:
Thought they might ruin him they could create;
Or melt him to that golden calf, a state.
But these were random bolts: no form'd design,
Nor interest made the factious crowd to join:
The sober part of Israel, free from stain,
Well knew the value of a peaceful reign:
And, looking backward with a wise afright,
Saw seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight:
In contemplation of whose ugly scars,
They curst the memory of civil wars.
The moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd,
Inclin'd the balance to the better side:
And, David's mildness manag'd it so well,
The bad found no occasion to rebel.
But, when to sin our bias'd nature leans,
The careful Devil is still at hand with means;
And providently pimps for ill desires:
The good old cause reviv'd, a plot requires.
Plots, true or false, are necessary things,
To raise up common-wealths, and ruin kings.

  Th' inhabitants of old Jerusalem
Were Jebusites: the town so call'd from them;
And theirs the native right—
But when the chosen people grew more strong,
The rightful cause at length became the wrong:
And every loss the men of Jebus bore,
They still were thought God's enemies the more.
Thus, worn and weaken'd, well or ill content,
Submit they must to David's government:
Impoverish'd and depriv'd of all command,
Their taxes doubled as they lost their land;
And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,
Their gods disgrac'd, and burnt like common wood.
This set the heathen priesthood in a flame;
For priests of all religions are the same:
Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,
Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,
In his defence his servants are as bold,
As if he had been born of beaten gold.
The Jewish Rabbins though their Enemies,
In this conclude them honest men and wise:
For 'twas their duty, all the learned think,
T'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink.
From hence began that plot, the nation's curse,
Bad in itself, but represented worse.
Rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decri'd;
With oaths affirm'd, with dying vows deni'd.
Not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the multitude;
But swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude.
Some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies;
To please the fools, and puzzle all the wise.
Succeeding times did equal folly call,
Believing nothing, or believing all.
Th' Egyptian rites the Jebusites embrac'd;
Where gods were recommended by their taste.
Such sav'ry deities must needs be good,
As serv'd at once for worship and for food.
By force they could not introduce these gods;
For ten to one, in former days was odds.
So fraud was us'd, (the sacrificers' trade,)
Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.
Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews;
And rak'd, for converts, even the court and stews:
Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took,
Because the fleece accompanies the flock.
Some thought they God's anointed meant to slay
By guns, invented since full many a day:
Our author swears it not; but who can know
How far the Devil and Jebusites may go?
This plot, which fail'd for want of common sense,
Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence:
For, as when raging fevers boil the blood,
The standing lake soon floats into a flood;
And ev'ry hostile humour, which before
Slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er:
So, several factions from this first ferment,
Work up to foam, and threat the government.
Some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise,
Oppos'd the pow'r, to which they could not rise.
Some had in courts been great, and thrown from thence,
Like fiends, were harden'd in impenitence.
Some by their monarch's fatal mercy grown,
From pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne;
Were rais'd in pow'r and public office high;
Strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie.

  Of these the false Achitophel was first:
A name to all succeeding ages curst.
For close designs, and crooked counsels fit;
Sagacious, bold and turbulent of wit:
Restless, unfixt in principles and place;
In pow'r unpleas'd, impatient of disgrace.
A fiery soul, which working out its way,
Fretted the pigmy-body to decay:
And o'er inform'd the tenement of clay.
A daring pilot in extremity;
Pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went high
He sought the storms; but for a calm unfit,
Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit.
Great wits are sure to madness near alli'd;
And thin partitions do their bounds divide:
Else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest,
Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?
Punish a body which he could not please;
Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?
And all to leave, what with his toil he won
To that unfeather'd, two-legg'd thing, a son:
Got, while his soul did huddled notions try;
And born a shapeless lump, like anarchy.
In friendship false, implacable in hate:
Resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state.
To compass this, the triple bond he broke;
The pillars of the public safety shook:
And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke.
Then, seiz'd with fear, yet still affecting fame,
Usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name.
So easy still it proves in factious times,
With public zeal to cancel private crimes:
How safe is treason, and how sacred ill,
Where none can sin against the people's will:
Where crowds can wink; and no offence be known,
Since in another's guilt they find their own.
Yet, fame deserv'd, no enemy can grudge;
The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge.
In Jewish courts ne'er sat an Abbethdin
With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean:
Unbrib'd, unsought, the wretched to redress;
Swift of dispatch, and easy of access.
Oh, had he been content to serve the crown,
With virtues only proper to the gown;
Or, had the rankness of the soil been freed
From cockle, that opprest the noble seed:
David, for him his tuneful harp had strung,
And heav'n had wanted one immortal song.
But wild ambition loves to slide, not stand;
And fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land:
Achitophel, grown weary to possess
A lawful fame, and lazy happiness;
Disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free,
And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree.
Now, manifest of crimes, contriv'd long since,
He stood at bold defiance with his prince:
Held up the buckler of the people's cause,
Against the crown; and skulk'd behind the laws.
The wish'd occasion of the plot he takes;
Some circumstances finds, but more he makes.
By buzzing emissaries, fills the ears
Of list'ning crowds, with jealousies and fears
Of arbitrary counsels brought to light,
And proves the king himself a Jebusite.
Weak arguments! which yet he knew full well,
Were strong with people easy to rebel.
For, govern'd by the moon, the giddy Jews
Tread the same track when she the prime renews:
And once in twenty years, their scribes record,
By natural instinct they change their lord.
Achitophel still wants a chief, and none
Was found so fit as warlike Absalom:
Not, that he wish'd his greatness to create,
(For politicians neither love nor hate:)
But, for he knew, his title not allow'd,
Would keep him still depending on the crowd:
That kingly pow'r, thus ebbing out, might be
Drawn to the dregs of a democracy.
Him he attempts, with studied arts to please,
And sheds his venom, in such words as these.

  Auspicious Prince! at whose nativity
Some royal planet rul'd the southern sky;
Thy longing country's darling and desire;
Their cloudy pillar, and their guardian fire:
Their second Moses, whose extended wand
Divides the seas, and shows the promis'd land:
Whose dawning day, in very distant age,
Has exercis'd the sacred prophet's rage:
The people's pray'r, the glad diviner's theme,
The young men's vision, and the old men's dream!
Thee, Saviour, thee, the nation's vows confess;
And, never satisfi'd with seeing, bless:
Swift, unbespoken pomps, thy steps proclaim,
And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name.
How long wilt thou the general joy detain;
Starve, and defraud the people of thy reign?
Content ingloriously to pass thy days
Like one of virtue's fools that feeds on praise;
Till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright,
Grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight.
Believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be,
Or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree.
Heav'n has to all allotted, soon or late,
Some lucky revolution of their fate:
Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill,
(For human good depends on human will,)
Our fortune rolls, as from a smooth descent,
And, from the first impression, takes the bent:
But, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind;
And leaves repenting folly far behind.
Now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize,
And spreads her locks before her as she flies.
Had thus Old David, from whose loins you spring,
Not dar'd, when fortune call'd him, to be king.
At Gath an exile he might still remain;
And Heaven's anointing oil had been in vain.
Let his successful youth your hopes engage;
But shun th'example of declining age:
Behold him setting in his western skies,
The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise.
He is not now, as when on Jordan's sand
The joyful people throng'd to see him land,
Cov'ring the beach, and black'ning all the strand:
But, like the Prince of Angels from his height,
Comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light:
Betray'd by one poor plot to public scorn:
(Our only blessing since his curst return:)
Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind,
Blown off, and scatter'd by a puff of wind.
What strength can he to your designs oppose,
Naked of friends and round beset with foes?
If Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use,
A foreign aid would more incense the Jews:
Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring;
Foment the war, but not support the king:
Nor would the royal party e'er unite
With Pharaoh's arms, t'assist the Jebusite;
Or if they should, their interest soon would break,
And with such odious aid, make David weak.
All sorts of men, by my successful arts,
Abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts
From David's rule: And 'tis the general Cry,
Religion, Common-wealth, and Liberty.
If, you, as champion of the public good,
Add to their arms a chief of royal blood;
What may not Israel hope, and what applause
Might such a general gain by such a cause?
Not barren praise alone, that gaudy flow'r,
Fair only to the sight, but solid pow'r:
And nobler is a limited command,
Giv'n by the love of all your native land,
Than a successive title, long, and dark,
Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's Ark.

  What cannot praise effect in mighty minds,
When flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds!
Desire of pow'r, on earth a vicious weed,
Yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed:
In God 'tis glory: And when men aspire,
'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire.
Th' ambitious youth, too covetous of fame,
Too full of angel's metal in his frame;
Unwarily was led from virtue's ways;
Made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise.
Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,
(For loyal blood within him struggled still)
He thus repli'd.—And what pretence have I
To take up arms for public liberty?
My Father governs with unquestion'd right;
The Faith's defender, and mankind's delight:
Good, gracious, just, observant of the laws;
And Heav'n by wonders has espous'd his cause.
Whom has he wrong'd in all his peaceful reign?
Who sues for justice to his throne in vain?
What millions has he pardon'd of his foes,
Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose?
Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good;
Inclin'd to mercy, and averse from blood.
If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,
His crime is God's beloved attribute.
What could he gain, his people to betray,
Or change his right, for arbitrary sway?
Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign,
His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train.
If David's rule Jerusalem displease,
The Dog-star heats their brains to this disease.
Why then should I, encouraging the bad,
Turn rebel, and run popularly mad?
Were he a tyrant who, by lawless might,
Oppress'd the Jews, and rais'd the Jebusite,
Well might I mourn; but nature's holy bands
Would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands:
The people might assert their liberty;
But what was right in them, were crime in me.
His favour leaves me nothing to require;
Prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire.
What more can I expect while David lives?
All but his kingly diadem he gives:
And that: but there he paus'd; then sighing, said,
Is justly destin'd for a worthier head.
For when my father from his toils shall rest,
And late augment the number of the blest:
His lawful issue shall the throne ascend;
Or the collat'ral line where that shall end.
His brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite,
Yet dauntless and secure of native right,
Of every royal virtue stands possess'd;
Still dear to all the bravest, and the best.
His courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim;
His loyalty the king, the world his fame.
His mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find:
For sure he comes of a forgiving kind.
Why should I then repine at Heaven's decree;
Which gives me no pretence to royalty?
Yet oh that Fate, propitiously inclin'd,
Had rais'd my birth, or had debas'd my mind;
To my large soul, not all her treasure lent,
And then betray'd it to a mean descent.
I find, I find my mounting spirits bold,
And David's part disdains my mother's mold.
Why am I scanted by a niggard-birth?
My soul disclaims the kindred of her earth:
And made for empire, whispers me within;
Desire of greatness is a god-like sin.

  Him staggering so when Hell's dire agent found,
While fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground,
He pours fresh forces in, and thus replies:

  Th'eternal God, supremely good and wise,
Imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain;
What wonders are reserv'd to bless your reign?
Against your will your arguments have shown,
Such virtue's only giv'n to guide a throne.
Not that your father's mildness I contemn;
But manly force becomes the diadem.
'Tis true, he grants the people all they crave;
And more perhaps than subjects ought to have:
For lavish grants suppose a monarch tame,
And more his goodness than his wit proclaim.
But when should people strive their bonds to break,
If not when kings are negligent or weak?
Let him give on till he can give no more,
The thrifty Sanhedrin shall keep him poor:
And every shekel which he can receive,
Shall cost a limb of his prerogative.
To ply him with new plots, shall be my care;
Or plunge him deep in some expensive war;
Which, when his treasure can no more supply,
He must, with the remains of kingship, buy.
His faithful friends, our jealousies and fears
Call Jebusites; and Pharaoh's pensioners:
Whom, when our fury from his aid has torn,
He shall be naked left to public scorn.
The next successor, whom I fear and hate,
My arts have made obnoxious to the state;
Turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow,
And gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe.
His right, for sums of necessary gold,
Shall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold:
Till time shall ever-wanting David draw,
To pass your doubtful title into law:
If not; the people have a right supreme
To make their kings; for kings are made for them.
All empire is no more than pow'r in trust:
Which when resum'd, can be no longer just.
Succession, for the general good design'd,
In its own wrong a nation cannot bind:
If altering that, the people can relieve,
Better one suffer, than a nation grieve.
The Jews well know their pow'r: ere Saul they chose,
God was their king, and God they durst depose.
Urge now your piety, your filial name,
A father's right, and fear of future fame;
The public good, the universal call,
To which even Heav'n submitted, answers all.
Nor let his love enchant your generous mind;
'Tis Nature's trick to propagate her kind.
Our fond begetters, who would never die,
Love but themselves in their posterity.
Or let his kindness by th'effects be tri'd,
Or let him lay his vain pretence aside.
God said he lov'd your father; could he bring
A better proof, than to anoint him king?
It surely show'd he lov'd the shepherd well,
Who gave so fair a flock as Israel.
Would David have you thought his darling son?
What means he then, to alienate the crown?
The name of godly he may blush to bear:
'Tis after God's own heart to cheat his heir.
He to his brother gives supreme command;
To you a legacy of barren land:
Perhaps th'old harp, on which he thrums his lays:
Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise.
Then the next heir, a prince, severe and wise
Already looks on you with jealous eyes;
Sees through the thin disguises of your arts,
And marks your progress in the people's hearts.
Though now his mighty soul in grief contains,
He meditates revenge who least complains;
And like a lion, slumb'ring in the way,
Or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey,
His fearless foes within his distance draws;
Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws:
Till at the last, his time for fury found,
He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:
The prostrate vulgar, passes o'er, and spares;
But with a lordly rage, his hunters tears.
Your case no tame expedients will afford;
Resolve on death, or conquest by the sword,
Which for no less a stake than life, you draw;
And self-defence is Nature's eldest law.
Leave the warm people no considering time;
For then rebellion may be thought a crime.
Prevail yourself of what occasion gives,
But try your title while your father lives:
And that your arms may have a fair pretence,
Proclaim, you take them in the king's defence:
Whose sacred life each minute would expose
To plots from seeming friends and secret foes.
And who can sound the depth of David's soul?
Perhaps his fear, his kindness may control.
He fears his brother, though he loves his son,
For plighted vows too late to be undone.
If so, by force he wishes to be gain'd;
Like women's lechery, to seem constrain'd:
Doubt not; but when he most affects the frown,
Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown.
Secure his person to secure your cause;
They who possess the prince, possess the laws.

  He said, and this advice above the rest
With Absalom's mild nature suited best;
Unblam'd of life, (ambition set aside,)
Not stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride.
How happy had he been, if destiny
Had higher plac'd his birth, or not so high!
His kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne;
And blest all other countries but his own:
But charming greatness since so few refuse,
'Tis juster to lament him, than accuse.
Strong were his hopes a rival to remove,
With blandishments to gain the public love;
To head the faction while their zeal was hot,
And popularly prosecute the plot.
To farther this Achitophel unites
The malcontents of all the Israelites:
Whose differing parties he could wisely join,
For several ends, to serve the same design.
The best, and of the princes some were such,
Who thought the pow'r of monarchy too much:
Mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts;
Not wicked, but seduc'd by impious arts.
By these the springs of property were bent,
And wound so high, they crack'd the government.
The next for interest sought t'embroil the state,
To sell their duty at a dearer rate;
And make their Jewish markets of the throne;
Pretending public good, to serve their own.
Others thought kings an useless heavy load,
Who cost too much, and did too little good.
These were for laying honest David by,
On principles of pure good husbandry.
With them join'd all th'haranguers of the throng,
That thought to get preferment by the tongue.
Who follow next, a double danger bring,
Not only hating David, but the king;
The Solymaean rout; well vers'd of old
In godly faction, and in treason bold;
Cow'ring and quaking at a conqu'ror's sword,
But lofty to a lawful prince restor'd;
Saw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun,
And scorn'd by Jebusites to be out-done.
Hot Levites headed these; who pull'd before
From th'Ark, which in the Judges' days they bore,
Resum'd their Cant, and with a zealous cry,
Pursu'd their old belov'd Theocracy.
Where Sanhedrin and Priest enslav'd the nation,
And justifi'd their spoils by inspiration:
For who so fit for reign as Aaron's race,
If once dominion they could found in Grace?
These led the pack; though not of surest scent,
Yet deepest mouth'd against the government.
A numerous host of dreaming saints succeed;
Of the true old enthusiastic breed:
'Gainst form and order they their pow'r employ;
Nothing to build, and all things to destroy.
But far more numerous was the herd of such,
Who think too little, and who talk too much.
These, out of mere instinct, they knew not why,
Ador'd their father's God, and property:
And by the same blind benefit of fate,
The Devil and the Jebusite did hate:
Born to be saved even in their own despite;
Because they could not help believing right.
Such were the tools; but a whole Hydra more
Remains, of sprouting heads too long, to score.
Some of their chiefs were princes of the land:
In the first rank of these did Zimri stand:
A man so various, that he seem'd to be
Not one, but all Mankind's Epitome.
Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;
Was everything by starts, and nothing long:
But in the course of one revolving moon,
Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:
Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking;
Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.
Blest madman, who could every hour employ,
With something new to wish, or to enjoy!
Railing and praising were his usual themes;
And both (to show his judgment) in extremes:
So over violent, or over civil,
That every man, with him, was god or devil.
In squandering wealth was his peculiar art:
Nothing went unrewarded, but desert.
Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late:
He had his jest, and they had his estate.
He laugh'd himself from court; then sought relief
By forming parties, but could ne'er be chief:
For, spite of him, the weight of business fell
On Absalom and wise Achitophel:
Thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft,
He left not faction, but of that was left.

  Titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse
Of lords, below the dignity of verse.
Wits, warriors, commonwealths-men, were the best:
Kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest.
And, therefore in the name of dullness, be
The well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free.
And canting Nadab let oblivion damn,
Who made new porridge for the Paschal Lamb.
Let friendship's holy band some names assure:
Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure.
Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place,
Whom kings no titles gave, and God no grace:
Not bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes draw
To mean rebellion, and make treason law.
But he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse,
The wretch, who Heav'n's Anointed dar'd to curse.
Shimei, whose youth did early promise bring
Of zeal to God, and hatred to his king;
Did wisely from expensive sins refrain,
And never broke the Sabbath, but for gain:
Nor ever was he known an oath to vent,
Or curse, unless against the government.
Thus, heaping wealth, by the most ready way
Among the Jews, which was to cheat and pray;
The city, to reward his pious hate
Against his master, chose him magistrate:
His hand a vare of justice did uphold;
His neck was loaded with a chain of gold.
During his office, treason was no crime.
The sons of Belial had a glorious time:
For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,
Yet lov'd his wicked neighbour as himself:
When two or three were gather'd to declaim
Against the monarch of Jerusalem,
Shimei was always in the midst of them.
And, if they curst the king when he was by,
Would rather curse, than break good company.
If any durst his factious friends accuse,
He pack'd a jury of dissenting Jews:
Whose fellow-feeling, in the godly cause,
Would free the suff'ring saint from human laws.
For laws are only made to punish those
Who serve the king, and to protect his foes.
If any leisure time he had from pow'r,
(Because 'tis sin to mis-employ an hour;)
His bus'ness was, by writing, to persuade,
That kings were useless, and a clog to trade:
And, that his noble style he might refine,
No Rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wine.
Chaste were his cellars; and his shrieval board
The grossness of a city feast abhorr'd:
His cooks, with long disuse, their trade forgot;
Cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot.
Such frugal virtue malice may accuse;
But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews:
For towns once burnt, such magistrates require
As dare not tempt God's providence by fire.
With spiritual food he fed his servants well,
But free from flesh, that made the Jews rebel:
And Moses' laws he held in more account
For forty days of fasting in the mount.
To speak the rest, who better are forgot,
Would tire a well-breath'd witness of the plot:
Yet, Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass;
Erect thyself thou monumental brass:
High as the serpent of thy metal made,
While nations stand secure beneath thy shade.
What though his birth were base, yet comets rise
From earthy vapours e'er they shine in skies.
Prodigious actions may as well be done
By weaver's issue, as by prince's son.
This arch-attestor, for the public good,
By that one deed ennobles all his blood.
Who ever ask'd the witnesses' high race,
Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace?
Ours was a Levite, and as times went then,
His tribe were God-almighty's gentlemen.
Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud,
Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud:
His long chin prov'd his wit; his saint-like grace
A church vermilion, and a Moses' face.
His memory, miraculously great,
Could plots exceeding man's belief, repeat;
Which therefore cannot be accounted lies,
For human wit could never such devise.
Some future truths are mingled in his book;
But, where the witness fail'd, the Prophet spoke:
Some things like visionary flights appear;
The spirit caught him up, the Lord knows where:
And gave him his rabbinical degree,
Unknown to foreign university.
His judgment yet his mem'ry did excel:
Which piec'd his wondrous evidence so well:
And suited to the temper of the times;
Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes.
Let Israel's foes suspect his Heav'nly call,
And rashly judge his writ apocryphal;
Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made:
He takes his life, who takes away his trade.
Were I myself in witness Corah's place,
The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace,
Should whet my memory, though once forgot,
To make him an appendix of my plot.
His zeal to Heav'n made him his prince despise,
And load his person with indignities:
But Zeal peculiar privilege affords,
Indulging latitude to deeds and words.
And Corah might for Agag's murther call,
In terms as coarse as Samuel us'd to Saul.
What others in his evidence did join,
(The best that could be had for love or coin,)
In Corah's own predicament will fall:
For Witness is a common name to all.

  Surrounded thus with friends of every sort,
Deluded Absalom forsakes the court:
Impatient of high hopes, urg'd with renown,
And fir'd with near possession of a crown:
Th' admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise,
And on his goodly person feed their eyes:
His joy conceal'd, he sets himself to show;
On each side bowing popularly low:
His looks, his gestures, and his words he frames,
And with familiar ease repeats their names.
Thus, form'd by Nature, furnish'd out with arts,
He glides unfelt into their secret hearts:
Then, with a kind compassionating look,
And sighs, bespeaking pity e'er he spoke:
Few words he said; but easy those and fit:
More slow than Hybla drops, and far more sweet.

  I mourn, my country-men, your lost estate;
Though far unable to prevent your fate:
Behold a banish'd man, for your dear cause
Expos'd a prey to arbitrary laws!
Yet oh! that I alone could be undone,
Cut off from empire, and no more a son!
Now all your liberties a spoil are made;
Egypt and Tyrus intercept your trade,
And Jebusites your sacred rites invade.
My father, whom with reverence yet I name,
Charm'd into ease, is careless of his fame:
And, brib'd with petty sums of foreign gold,
Is grown in Bathsheba's embraces old:
Exalts his enemies, his friends destroys:
And all his pow'r against himself employs.
He gives, and let him give my right away:
But why should he his own, and yours betray?
He, only he can make the nation bleed,
And he alone from my revenge is freed.
Take then my tears (with that he wip'd his eyes)
'Tis all the aid my present pow'r supplies:
No court-informer can these arms accuse;
These arms may sons against their fathers use;
And, 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign
May make no other Israelite complain.

  Youth, beauty, graceful action, seldom fail:
But common interest always will prevail:
And pity never ceases to be shown
To him, who makes the people's wrongs his own.
The crowd, (that still believe their kings oppress,)
With lifted hands their young Messiah bless:
Who now begins his progress to ordain;
With chariots, horsemen, and a num'rous train:
From East to West his glories he displays:
And, like the sun, the Promis'd Land surveys.
Fame runs before him, as the Morning-Star;
And shouts of joy salute him from afar:
Each house receives him as a guardian God;
And consecrates the place of his abode:
But hospitable treats did most commend
Wise Issachar, his wealthy western friend.
This moving court, that caught the people's eyes,
And seem'd but pomp, did other ends disguise:
Achitophel had form'd it, with intent
To sound the depths, and fathom where it went,
The people's hearts; distinguish friends from foes;
And try their strength, before they came to blows.
Yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretence
Of specious love, and duty to their prince.
Religion, and redress of grievances,
Two names, that always cheat and always please,
Are often urg'd; and good King David's life
Endanger'd by a brother and a wife.
Thus, in a pageant show, a plot is made;
And peace itself is war in masquerade.
Oh foolish Israel! never warn'd by ill:
Still the same bait, and circumvented still!
Did ever men forsake their present ease,
In midst of health imagine a disease;
Take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee,
Make heirs for monarchs, and for God decree?
What shall we think! Can people give away
Both for themselves and sons, their native sway?
Then they are left defenceless to the sword
Of each unbounded arbitrary lord:
And laws are vain, by which we right enjoy,
If kings unquestion'd can those laws destroy.
Yet, if the crowd be judge of fit and just,
And kings are only officers in trust,
Then this resuming cov'nant was declar'd
When Kings were made, or is for ever bar'd:
If those who gave the sceptre could not tie
By their own deed their own posterity,
How then could Adam bind his future race?
How could his forfeit on mankind take place?
Or how could heavenly justice damn us all,
Who ne'er consented to our father's fall?
Then kings are slaves to those whom they command,
And tenants to their people's pleasure stand.
Add, that the pow'r for property allow'd,
Is mischievously seated in the crowd:
For who can be secure of private right,
If sovereign sway may be dissolv'd by might?
Nor is the people's judgment always true:
The most may err as grossly as the few.
And faultless kings run down, by common cry,
For vice, oppression and for tyranny.
What standard is there in a fickle rout,
Which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out?
Nor only crowds, but Sanhedrins may be
Infected with this public lunacy:
And share the madness of rebellious times,
To murther monarchs for imagin'd crimes.
If they may give and take whene'er they please,
Not kings alone, (the godhead's images,)
But government itself at length must fall
To nature's state, where all have right to all.
Yet, grant our lords the people kings can make,
What prudent men a settled throne would shake?
For whatsoe'er their sufferings were before,
That change they covet makes them suffer more.
All other errors but disturb a state;
But innovation is the blow of fate.
If ancient fabrics nod, and threat to fall,
To patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall,
Thus far 'tis duty; but here fix the mark:
For all beyond it is to touch our Ark.
To change foundations, cast the frame anew,
Is work for rebels who base ends pursue:
At once divine and human laws control;
And mend the parts by ruin of the whole.
The tamp'ring world is subject to this curse,
To physic their disease into a worse.

  Now what relief can righteous David bring?
How fatal 'tis to be too good a king!
Friends he has few, so high the madness grows;
Who dare be such, must be the people's foes:
Yet some there were, ev'n in the worst of days;
Some let me name, and naming is to praise.

  In this short file Barzillai first appears;
Barzillai crown'd with honour and with years:
Long since, the rising rebels he withstood
In regions waste, beyond the Jordan's flood:
Unfortunately brave to buoy the state;
But sinking underneath his master's fate:
In exile with his god-like prince he mourn'd:
For him he suffer'd, and with him return'd.
The court he practis'd, not the courtier's art:
Large was his wealth, but larger was his heart:
Which well the noblest objects knew to choose,
The fighting warrior, and recording Muse.
His bed could once a fruitful issue boast:
Now more than half a father's name is lost.
His eldest hope, with every grace adorn'd,
By me (so Heav'n will have it) always mourn'd,
And always honour'd, snatch'd in manhood's prime
B' unequal Fates, and Providence's crime:
Yet not before the goal of honour won,
All parts fulfill'd, of subject and of son;
Swift was the race, but short the time to run.
Oh narrow circle, but of pow'r divine,
Scanted in space, but perfect in thy line!
By sea, by land, thy matchless worth was known;
Arms thy delight, and war was all thy own:
Thy force infus'd, the fainting Tyrians propp'd:
And haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stopp'd.
Oh ancient honour, Oh unconquer'd Hand,
Whom foes unpunish'd never could withstand!
But Israel was unworthy of thy name:
Short is the date of all immoderate fame.
It looks as Heav'n our ruin had design'd,
And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind.
Now, free from earth, thy disencumber'd Soul
Mounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole:
From thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring,
To aid the Guardian Angel of thy king.
Here stop my Muse, here cease thy painful flight;
No pinions can pursue immortal height:
Tell good Barzillai thou canst sing no more,
And tell thy soul she should have fled before;
Or fled she with his life, and left this verse
To hang on her departed patron's hearse?
Now take thy steepy flight from Heav'n, and see
If thou canst find on earth another he;
Another he would be too hard to find,
See then whom thou canst see not far behind.
Zadoc the priest whom, shunning, pow'r and place,
His lowly mind advanc'd to David's grace:
With him the Sagan of Jerusalem,
Of hospitable soul and noble stem;
Him of the western dome, whose weighty sense
Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence.
The Prophet's sons by such example led,
To learning and to loyalty were bred:
For colleges on bounteous kings depend,
And never rebel was to arts a friend.
To these succeed the pillars of the laws,
Who best could plead, and best can judge a cause.
Next them a train of loyal peers ascend:
Sharp judging Adriel, the Muse's friend,
Himself a Muse:—in Sanhedrin's debate
True to his prince; but not a slave of state.
Whom David's love with honours did adorn,
That from his disobedient son were torn.
Jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought,
Endow'd by Nature, and by learning taught
To move assemblies, who but only tri'd
The worse awhile, then chose the better side;
Nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too;
So much the weight of one brave man can do.
Hushai, the friend of David in distress,
In public storms of manly steadfastness;
By foreign treaties he inform'd his youth;
And join'd experience to his native truth.
His frugal care suppli'd the wanting throne;
Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own:
'Tis easy conduct when exchequers flow;
But hard the task to manage well the low:
For sovereign power is too depress'd or high,
When kings are forc'd to sell, or crowds to buy.
Indulge one labour more, my weary Muse,
For Amiel, who can Amiel's praise refuse?
Of ancient race by birth, but nobler yet
In his own worth, and without title great:
The Sanhedrin long time as chief he rul'd,
Their reason guided, and their passion cool'd;
So dext'rous was he in the crown's defence,
So form'd to speak a loyal nation's sense,
That as their band was Israel's tribes in small,
So fit was he to represent them all.
Now rasher charioteers the seat ascend,
Whose loose careers his steady skill commend:
They, like th'unequal ruler of the day,
Misguide the seasons and mistake the way;
While he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles,
And safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils.

  These were the chief; a small but faithful band
Of worthies, in the breach who dar'd to stand,
And tempt th'united fury of the land.
With grief they view'd such powerful engines bent,
To batter down the lawful government.
A numerous faction with pretended frights,
In Sanhedrins to plume the regal rights.
The true successor from the court remov'd:
The plot, by hireling witnesses, improv'd.
These ills they saw, and as their duty bound,
They show'd the king the danger of the wound:
That no concessions from the throne would please;
But lenitives fomented the disease:
That Absalom, ambitious of the crown,
Was made the lure to draw the people down:
That false Achitophel's pernicious hate,
Had turn'd the plot to ruin church and state:
The Council violent, the rabble worse:
That Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse.

  With all these loads of injuries opprest,
And long revolving in his careful breast
Th'event of things; at last his patience tir'd,
Thus from his royal throne, by Heav'n inspir'd,
The god-like David spoke; and awful fear
His train their Maker in their Master hear.

  Thus long have I by native mercy sway'd,
My wrongs dissembl'd, my revenge delay'd:
So willing to forgive th'offending age;
So much the father did the king assuage.
But now so far my clemency they slight,
Th' offenders question my forgiving right.
That one was made for many, they contend:
But 'tis to rule, for that's a monarch's end.
They call my tenderness of blood, my fear:
Though manly tempers can the longest bear.
Yet, since they will divert my native course,
'Tis time to shew I am not good by force.
Those heap'd affronts that haughty subjects bring,
Are burdens for a camel, not a king:
Kings are the public pillars of the state,
Born to sustain and prop the nation's weight:
If my young Sampson will pretend a call
To shake the column, let him share the fall:
But oh that yet he would repent and live!
How easy 'tis for parents to forgive!
With how few tears a pardon might be won
From Nature, pleading for a darling son!
Poor pitied youth, by my paternal care,
Rais'd up to all the heights his frame could bear:
Had God ordain'd his fate for empire born,
He would have giv'n his soul another turn:
Gull'd with a patriot's name, whose modern sense
Is one that would by law supplant his prince:
The people's brave, the politician's tool;
Never was patriot yet, but was a fool.
Whence comes it that religion and the laws
Should more be Absalom's than David's cause?
His old instructor, e'er he lost his place,
Was never thought endued with so much grace.
Good heav'ns, how faction can a patriot paint!
My rebel ever proves my people's saint;
Would they impose an heir upon the throne?
Let Sanhedrins be taught to give their own.
A king's at least a part of government;
And mine as requisite as their consent:
Without my leave a future king to choose,
Infers a right the present to depose;
True, they petition me t'approve their choice:
But Esau's hands suit ill with Jacob's voice.
My pious subjects for my safety pray,
Which to secure they take my pow'r away.
From plots and treasons Heav'n preserve my years
But save me most from my petitioners.
Unsatiate as the barren womb or grave;
God cannot grant so much as they can crave.
What then is left but with a jealous eye
To guard the small remains of royalty?
The law shall still direct my peaceful sway,
And the same law teach rebels to obey:
Votes shall no more establish'd pow'r control,
Such votes as make a part exceed the whole:
No groundless clamours shall my friends remove,
Nor crowds have pow'r to punish ere they prove:
For gods, and god-like kings their care express,
Still to defend their servants in distress.
Oh that my pow'r to saving were confin'd:
Why am I forc'd, like Heav'n, against my mind,
To make examples of another kind?
Must I at length the sword of justice draw?
Oh curst effects of necessary law!
How ill my fear they by my mercy scan,
Beware the fury of a patient man.
Law they require, let law then show her face;
They could not be content to look on grace,
Her hinder parts, but with a daring eye
To tempt the terror of her front, and die.
By their own arts 'tis righteously decreed,
Those dire artificers of death shall bleed.
Against themselves their witnesses will swear,
Till viper-like their mother plot they tear:
And suck for nutriment that bloody gore
Which was their principle of life before.
Their Belial with the Belzebub will fight;
Thus on my foes, my foes shall do me right:

Nor doubt th'event: for factious crowds engage
In their first onset, all their brutal rage;
Then, let 'em take an unresisted course:
Retire and traverse, and delude their force:
But when they stand all breathless, urge the fight,
And rise upon 'em with redoubled might:
For lawful pow'r is still superior found,
When long driv'n back, at length it stands the ground.

  He said. Th' Almighty, nodding, gave consent;
And peals of thunder shook the firmament.
Henceforth a series of new time began,
The mighty years in long procession ran:
Once more the god-like David was restor'd,
And willing nations knew their lawful lord.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Judaism', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44172/absalom-and-achitophel,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-dryden,,1631.0,1700.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Dryden,1631–1700,Mac Flecknoe,"A Satire upon the True-blue Protestant Poet T.S.

All human things are subject to decay,
And, when Fate summons, monarchs must obey:
This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, young
Was call'd to empire, and had govern'd long:
In prose and verse, was own'd, without dispute
Through all the realms of Non-sense, absolute.
This aged prince now flourishing in peace,
And blest with issue of a large increase,
Worn out with business, did at length debate
To settle the succession of the State:
And pond'ring which of all his sons was fit
To reign, and wage immortal war with wit;
Cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that he
Should only rule, who most resembles me:
Shadwell alone my perfect image bears,
Mature in dullness from his tender years.
Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is he
Who stands confirm'd in full stupidity.
The rest to some faint meaning make pretence,
But Shadwell never deviates into sense.
Some beams of wit on other souls may fall,
Strike through and make a lucid interval;
But Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray,
His rising fogs prevail upon the day:
Besides his goodly fabric fills the eye,
And seems design'd for thoughtless majesty:
Thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain,
And, spread in solemn state, supinely reign.
Heywood and Shirley were but types of thee,
Thou last great prophet of tautology:
Even I, a dunce of more renown than they,
Was sent before but to prepare thy way;
And coarsely clad in Norwich drugget came
To teach the nations in thy greater name.
My warbling lute, the lute I whilom strung
When to King John of Portugal I sung,
Was but the prelude to that glorious day,
When thou on silver Thames did'st cut thy way,
With well tim'd oars before the royal barge,
Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge;
And big with hymn, commander of an host,
The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets toss'd.
Methinks I see the new Arion sail,
The lute still trembling underneath thy nail.
At thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shore
The treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar:
Echoes from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell call,
And Shadwell they resound from Aston Hall.
About thy boat the little fishes throng,
As at the morning toast, that floats along.
Sometimes as prince of thy harmonious band
Thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand.
St. Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time,
Not ev'n the feet of thy own Psyche's rhyme:
Though they in number as in sense excel;
So just, so like tautology they fell,
That, pale with envy, Singleton forswore
The lute and sword which he in triumph bore
And vow'd he ne'er would act Villerius more.
Here stopt the good old sire; and wept for joy
In silent raptures of the hopeful boy.
All arguments, but most his plays, persuade,
That for anointed dullness he was made.

     Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind,
(The fair Augusta much to fears inclin'd)
An ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the sight,
There stood of yore, and Barbican it hight:
A watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains,
Of all the pile an empty name remains.
From its old ruins brothel-houses rise,
Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys.
Where their vast courts, the mother-strumpets keep,
And, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep.
Near these a nursery erects its head,
Where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred;
Where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry,
Where infant punks their tender voices try,
And little Maximins the gods defy.
Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here,
Nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear;
But gentle Simkin just reception finds
Amidst this monument of vanish'd minds:
Pure clinches, the suburbian muse affords;
And Panton waging harmless war with words.
Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known,
Ambitiously design'd his Shadwell's throne.
For ancient Decker prophesi'd long since,
That in this pile should reign a mighty prince,
Born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense:
To whom true dullness should some Psyches owe,
But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow;
Humorists and hypocrites it should produce,
Whole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce.

     Now Empress Fame had publisht the renown,
Of Shadwell's coronation through the town.
Rous'd by report of fame, the nations meet,
From near Bun-Hill, and distant Watling-street.
No Persian carpets spread th'imperial way,
But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay:
From dusty shops neglected authors come,
Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum.
Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby there lay,
But loads of Shadwell almost chok'd the way.
Bilk'd stationers for yeoman stood prepar'd,
And Herringman was Captain of the Guard.
The hoary prince in majesty appear'd,
High on a throne of his own labours rear'd.
At his right hand our young Ascanius sat
Rome's other hope, and pillar of the state.
His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,
And lambent dullness play'd around his face.
As Hannibal did to the altars come,
Sworn by his sire a mortal foe to Rome;
So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain,
That he till death true dullness would maintain;
And in his father's right, and realm's defence,
Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense.
The king himself the sacred unction made,
As king by office, and as priest by trade:
In his sinister hand, instead of ball,
He plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale;
Love's kingdom to his right he did convey,
At once his sceptre and his rule of sway;
Whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young,
And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung,
His temples last with poppies were o'er spread,
That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head:
Just at that point of time, if fame not lie,
On his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly.
So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's brook,
Presage of sway from twice six vultures took.
Th'admiring throng loud acclamations make,
And omens of his future empire take.
The sire then shook the honours of his head,
And from his brows damps of oblivion shed
Full on the filial dullness: long he stood,
Repelling from his breast the raging god;
At length burst out in this prophetic mood:

    Heavens bless my son, from Ireland let him reign
To far Barbadoes on the Western main;
Of his dominion may no end be known,
And greater than his father's be his throne.
Beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen;
He paus'd, and all the people cry'd Amen.
Then thus, continu'd he, my son advance
Still in new impudence, new ignorance.
Success let other teach, learn thou from me
Pangs without birth, and fruitless industry.
Let Virtuosos in five years be writ;
Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit.
Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage,
Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;
Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,
And in their folly show the writer's wit.
Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,
And justify their author's want of sense.
Let 'em be all by thy own model made
Of dullness, and desire no foreign aid:
That they to future ages may be known,
Not copies drawn, but issue of thy own.
Nay let thy men of wit too be the same,
All full of thee, and differing but in name;
But let no alien Sedley interpose
To lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.
And when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st cull,
Trust Nature, do not labour to be dull;
But write thy best, and top; and in each line,
Sir Formal's oratory will be thine.
Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,
And does thy Northern Dedications fill.
Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,
By arrogating Jonson's hostile name.
Let Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise,
And Uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.
Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part;
What share have we in Nature or in Art?
Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,
And rail at arts he did not understand?
Where made he love in Prince Nicander's vein,
Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain?
Where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse,
Promis'd a play and dwindled to a farce?
When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,
As thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine?
But so transfus'd as oil on waters flow,
His always floats above, thine sinks below.
This is thy province, this thy wondrous way,
New humours to invent for each new play:
This is that boasted bias of thy mind,
By which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd,
Which makes thy writings lean on one side still,
And in all changes that way bends thy will.
Nor let thy mountain belly make pretence
Of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.
A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,
But sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit.
Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep,
Thy Tragic Muse gives smiles, thy Comic sleep.
With whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write,
Thy inoffensive satires never bite.
In thy felonious heart, though venom lies,
It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.
Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame
In keen iambics, but mild anagram:
Leave writing plays, and choose for thy command
Some peaceful province in acrostic land.
There thou may'st wings display and altars raise,
And torture one poor word ten thousand ways.
Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,
Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.
He said, but his last words were scarcely heard,
For Bruce and Longvil had a trap prepar'd,
And down they sent the yet declaiming bard.
Sinking he left his drugget robe behind,
Born upwards by a subterranean wind.
The mantle fell to the young prophet's part,
With double portion of his father's art.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Related Audio', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Couplet', 'Epigraph']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44181/mac-flecknoe,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-dryden,,1631.0,1700.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

John Dryden,1631–1700,To the Pious Memory of the Accomplished Young Lady Mrs. Anne Killigrew,"Excellent In The Two Sister-Arts Of POËsy And Painting: An Ode

1
Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies,
     Made in the last promotion of the Blest;
Whose palms, new pluck'd from Paradise,
In spreading branches more sublimely rise,
Rich with immortal green above the rest:
Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,
Thou roll'st above us, in thy wand'ring race,
     Or, in procession fix'd and regular,
     Mov'd with the Heavens' majestic pace:
     Or, call'd to more superior bliss,
Thou tread'st, with seraphims, the vast abyss.
What ever happy region is thy place,
Cease thy celestial song a little space;
(Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine,
     Since Heav'n's eternal year is thine.)
Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse,
               In no ignoble verse;
But such as thy own voice did practise here,
When thy first fruits of poesy were giv'n;
To make thyself a welcome inmate there:
          While yet a young probationer,
          And Candidate of Heav'n.

2
     If by traduction came thy mind,
     Our wonder is the less to find
A soul so charming from a stock so good;
Thy father was transfus'd into thy blood:
So wert thou born into the tuneful strain,
(An early, rich, and inexhausted vein.)
     But if thy preexisting soul
     Was form'd, at first, with myriads more,
It did through all the mighty poets roll,
     Who Greek or Latin laurels wore,
And was that Sappho last, which once it was before.
     If so, then cease thy flight, O Heav'n-born mind!
          Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore:
     Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find,
     Than was the beauteous frame she left behind:
Return, to fill or mend the choir, of thy celestial kind.

3
May we presume to say, that at thy birth,
New joy was sprung in Heav'n as well as here on earth.
For sure the milder planets did combine
On thy auspicious horoscope to shine,
And ev'n the most malicious were in trine.
          Thy brother-angels at thy birth
          Strung each his lyre, and tun'd it high,
          That all the people of the sky
Might know a poetess was born on earth;
          And then if ever, mortal ears
          Had heard the music of the spheres!
          And if no clust'ring swarm of bees
     On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew,
          'Twas that, such vulgar miracles,
          Heav'n had not leisure to renew:
     For all the blest fraternity of love
Solemniz'd there thy birth, and kept thy Holyday above.

4
     O Gracious God! How far have we
Profan'd thy Heav'nly gift of poesy?
Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,
Debas'd to each obscene and impious use,
Whose harmony was first ordain'd above
For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love?
O wretched we! why were we hurried down
     This lubrique and adult'rate age,
     (Nay added fat pollutions of our own)
     T'increase the steaming ordures of the stage?
     What can we say t'excuse our Second Fall?
     Let this thy vestal, Heav'n, atone for all!
     Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,
     Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefil'd,
Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child!

5
     Art she had none, yet wanted none:
     For Nature did that want supply,
     So rich in treasures of her own,
     She might our boasted stores defy:
Such noble vigour did her verse adorn,
That it seem'd borrow'd, where 'twas only born.
Her morals too were in her bosom bred
     By great examples daily fed,
What in the best of Books, her Father's Life, she read.
     And to be read her self she need not fear,
     Each test, and ev'ry light, her Muse will bear,
     Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
     Ev'n love (for love sometimes her Muse express'd)
Was but a lambent-flame which play'd about her breast:
     Light as the vapours of a morning dream,
So cold herself, whilst she such warmth express'd,
     'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream.

6
Born to the spacious empire of the Nine,
One would have thought, she should have been content
To manage well that mighty government;
But what can young ambitious souls confine?
     To the next realm she stretch'd her sway,
     For painture near adjoining lay,
A plenteous province, and alluring prey.
A chamber of dependences was fram'd,
(As conquerors will never want pretence,
     When arm'd, to justify th'offence)
And the whole fief, in right of poetry she claim'd.
     The country open lay without defence:
  For poets frequent inroads there had made,
       And perfectly could represent
  The shape, the face, with ev'ry lineament:
And all the large domains which the Dumb-sister sway'd,
     All bow'd beneath her government,
     Receiv'd in triumph wheresoe'er she went,
Her pencil drew, what e'er her soul design'd,
And oft the happy draught surpass'd the image in her mind.
     The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks,
     And fruitful plains and barren rocks,
     Of shallow brooks that flow'd so clear,
     The bottom did the top appear;
     Of deeper too and ampler floods,
     Which as in mirrors, show'd the woods;
     Of lofty trees, with sacred shades,
     And perspectives of pleasant glades,
     Where nymphs of brightest form appear,
     And shaggy satyrs standing near,
     Which them at once admire and fear.
     The ruins too of some majestic piece,
     Boasting the pow'r of ancient Rome or Greece,
     Whose statues, friezes, columns broken lie,
     And tho' defac'd, the wonder of the eye,
     What Nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst frame,
     Her forming hand gave feature to the name.
     So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before,
But when the peopl'd Ark the whole creation bore.

7
     The scene then chang'd, with bold erected look
Our martial king the sight with reverence strook:
For not content t'express his outward part,
Her hand call'd out the image of his heart,
His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear,
His high-designing thoughts, were figur'd there,
As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear.
     Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so bright,
Beauty alone could beauty take so right:
Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace,
Were all observ'd, as well as heav'nly face.
With such a peerless majesty she stands,
As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands:
Before a train of heroines was seen,
In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen!
     Thus nothing to her genius was deny'd,
But like a ball of fire the further thrown,
          Still with a greater blaze she shone,
And her bright soul broke out on ev'ry side.
What next she had design'd, Heaven only knows,
To such immod'rate growth her conquest rose,
That fate alone its progress could oppose.

8
Now all those charms, that blooming grace,
The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face,
Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes;
In earth the much lamented virgin lies!
     Not wit, not piety could fate prevent;
     Nor was the cruel destiny content
     To finish all the murder at a blow,
     To sweep at once her life, and beauty too;
But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride
          To work more mischievously slow,
          And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd.
O double sacrilege on things divine,
To rob the relique, and deface the shrine!
          But thus Orinda died:
Heav'n, by the same disease, did both translate,
As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate.

9
Meantime her warlike brother on the seas
His waving streamers to the winds displays,
And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays.
     Ah, generous youth, that wish forbear,
     The winds too soon will waft thee here!
     Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,
Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at home!
No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,
Thou hast already had her last embrace.
But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far,
Among the Pleiad's, a new-kindl'd star,
If any sparkles, than the rest, more bright,
'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.

10
When in mid-air, the golden trump shall sound,
     To raise the nations under ground;
     When in the valley of Jehosophat,
The Judging God shall close the book of fate;
     And there the last Assizes keep,
     For those who wake, and those who sleep;
     When rattling bones together fly,
     From the four corners of the sky,
When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread,
Those cloth'd with flesh, and life inspires the dead;
The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,
And foremost from the tomb shall bound:
For they are cover'd with the lightest ground,
And straight, with in-born vigour, on the wing,
Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing.
There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shall go,
As harbinger of Heav'n, the way to show,
The way which thou so well hast learn'd below.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44190/to-the-pious-memory-of-the-accomplished-young-lady-mrs-anne-killigrew,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-dryden,,1631.0,1700.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

For I am as false and as fickle as she: 
We neither believe what either can say; 
And, neither believing, we neither betray. 
 
'Tis civil to swear and say things, of course; 
We mean not the taking for better or worse.

John Dryden,1631–1700,To my Dear Friend Mr. Congreve on his Comedy Call'd the Double Dealer,"Well then; the promis'd hour is come at last;
The present age of wit obscures the past:
Strong were our sires; and as they fought they writ,
Conqu'ring with force of arms, and dint of wit;
Theirs was the giant race, before the Flood;
And thus, when Charles return'd, our empire stood.
Like Janus he the stubborn soil manur'd,
With rules of husbandry the rankness cur'd:
Tam'd us to manners, when the stage was rude;
And boisterous English wit, with art endu'd.
Our age was cultivated thus at length;
But what we gained in skill we lost in strength.
Our builders were, with want of genius, curst;
The second temple was not like the first:
Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at length;
Our beauties equal; but excel our strength.
Firm Doric pillars found your solid base:
The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space;
Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace.
In easy dialogue is Fletcher's praise:
He mov'd the mind, but had not power to raise.
Great Jonson did by strength of judgment please:
Yet doubling Fletcher's force, he wants his ease.
In differing talents both adorn'd their age;
One for the study, t'other for the stage.
But both to Congreve justly shall submit,
One match'd in judgment, both o'er-match'd in wit.
In him all beauties of this age we see;
Etherege's courtship, Southern's purity;
The satire, wit, and strength of manly Wycherly.
All this in blooming youth you have achiev'd;
Nor are your foil'd contemporaries griev'd;
So much the sweetness of your manners move,
We cannot envy you because we love.
Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw
A beardless Consul made against the law,
And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome;
Though he with Hannibal was overcome.
Thus old Romano bow'd to Raphael's fame;
And scholar to the youth he taught, became.

     Oh that your brows my laurel had sustain'd,
Well had I been depos'd, if you had reign'd!
The father had descended for the son;
For only you are lineal to the throne.
Thus when the State one Edward did depose;
A greater Edward in his room arose.
But now, not I, but poetry is curs'd;
For Tom the second reigns like Tom the first.
But let 'em not mistake my patron's part;
Nor call his charity their own desert.
Yet this I prophesy; thou shalt be seen,
(Tho' with some short parenthesis between:)
High on the throne of wit; and seated there,
Not mine (that's little) but thy laurel wear.
Thy first attempt an early promise made;
That early promise this has more than paid.
So bold, yet so judiciously you dare,
That your least praise, is to be regular.
Time, place, and action, may with pains be wrought,
But genius must be born; and never can be taught.
This is your portion; this your native store;
Heav'n that but once was prodigal before,
To Shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.

     Maintain your post: that's all the fame you need;
For 'tis impossible you should proceed.
Already I am worn with cares and age;
And just abandoning th' ungrateful stage:
Unprofitably kept at Heav'n's expense,
I live a rent-charge on his providence:
But you, whom ev'ry muse and grace adorn,
Whom I foresee to better fortune born,
Be kind to my remains; and oh defend,
Against your judgment your departed friend!
Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue;
But shade those laurels which descend to you:
And take for tribute what these lines express:

Her morals too were in her bosom bred
     By great examples daily fed,
What in the best of Books, her Father's Life, she read.
     And to be read her self she need not fear,
     Each test, and ev'ry light, her Muse will bear,
     Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
     Ev'n love (for love sometimes her Muse express'd)
Was but a lambent-flame which play'd about her breast:
     Light as the vapours of a morning dream,
So cold herself, whilst she such warmth express'd,
     'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream.

6
Born to the spacious empire of the Nine,
One would have thought, she should have been content
To manage well that mighty government;
But what can young ambitious souls confine?
     To the next realm she stretch'd her sway,
     For painture near adjoining lay,
A plenteous province, and alluring prey.
A chamber of dependences was fram'd,
(As conquerors will never want pretence,
     When arm'd, to justify th'offence)
And the whole fief, in right of poetry she claim'd.
     The country open lay without defence:
  For poets frequent inroads there had made,
       And perfectly could represent
  The shape, the face, with ev'ry lineament:
And all the large domains which the Dumb-sister sway'd,
     All bow'd beneath her government,
     Receiv'd in triumph wheresoe'er she went,
Her pencil drew, what e'er her soul design'd,
And oft the happy draught surpass'd the image in her mind.
     The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks,
     And fruitful plains and barren rocks,
     Of shallow brooks that flow'd so clear,
     The bottom did the top appear;
     Of deeper too and ampler floods,
     Which as in mirrors, show'd the woods;
     Of lofty trees, with sacred shades,
     And perspectives of pleasant glades,
     Where nymphs of brightest form appear,
     And shaggy satyrs standing near,
     Which them at once admire and fear.
     The ruins too of some majestic piece,
     Boasting the pow'r of ancient Rome or Greece,
     Whose statues, friezes, columns broken lie,
     And tho' defac'd, the wonder of the eye,
     What Nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst frame,
     Her forming hand gave feature to the name.
     So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before,
But when the peopl'd Ark the whole creation bore.

7
     The scene then chang'd, with bold erected look
Our martial king the sight with reverence strook:
For not content t'express his outward part,
Her hand call'd out the image of his heart,
His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear,
His high-designing thoughts, were figur'd there,
As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear.
     Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so bright,
Beauty alone could beauty take so right:
Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace,
Were all observ'd, as well as heav'nly face.
With such a peerless majesty she stands,
As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands:
Before a train of heroines was seen,
In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen!
     Thus nothing to her genius was deny'd,
But like a ball of fire the further thrown,
          Still with a greater blaze she shone,
And her bright soul broke out on ev'ry side.
What next she had design'd, Heaven only knows,
To such immod'rate growth her conquest rose,
That fate alone its progress could oppose.

8
Now all those charms, that blooming grace,
The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face,
Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes;
In earth the much lamented virgin lies!
     Not wit, not piety could fate prevent;
     Nor was the cruel destiny content
     To finish all the murder at a blow,
     To sweep at once her life, and beauty too;
But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride
          To work more mischievously slow,
          And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd.
O double sacrilege on things divine,
To rob the relique, and deface the shrine!
          But thus Orinda died:
Heav'n, by the same disease, did both translate,
As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate.

9
Meantime her warlike brother on the seas
His waving streamers to the winds displays,
And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays.
     Ah, generous youth, that wish forbear,
     The winds too soon will waft thee here!
     Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,
Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at home!
No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,
Thou hast already had her last embrace.
But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far,
Among the Pleiad's, a new-kindl'd star,
If any sparkles, than the rest, more bright,
'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.

10
When in mid-air, the golden trump shall sound,
     To raise the nations under ground;
     When in the valley of Jehosophat,
The Judging God shall close the book of fate;
     And there the last Assizes keep,
     For those who wake, and those who sleep;
     When rattling bones together fly,
     From the four corners of the sky,
When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread,
Those cloth'd with flesh, and life inspires the dead;
The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,
And foremost from the tomb shall bound:
For they are cover'd with the lightest ground,
And straight, with in-born vigour, on the wing,
Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing.
There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shall go,
As harbinger of Heav'n, the way to show,

I sate, and he laid him down by me;

Aphra Behn,1640–1689,On the Death of the Late Earl of Rochester,"Mourn, mourn, ye Muses, all your loss deplore, 
The young, the noble Strephon is no more. 
Yes, yes, he fled quick as departing light, 
And ne’er shall rise from Death’s eternal night, 
So rich a prize the Stygian gods ne’er bore, 
Such wit, such beauty, never graced their shore. 
He was but lent this duller world t’ improve 
In all the charms of poetry, and love; 
Both were his gift, which freely he bestowed, 
And like a god, dealt to the wond’ring crowd. 
Scorning the little vanity of fame, 
Spight of himself attained a glorious name. 
But oh! in vain was all his peevish pride, 
The sun as soon might his vast luster hide, 
As piercing, pointed, and more lasting bright, 
As suffering no vicissitudes of night. 
   Mourn, mourn, ye Muses, all your loss deplore, 
   The young, the noble Strephon is no more. 
Now uninspired upon your banks we lie, 
Unless when we would mourn his elegy; 
His name’s a genius that would wit dispense, 
And give the theme a soul, the words a sense. 
But all fine thought that ravisht when it spoke, 
With the soft youth eternal leave has took; 
Uncommon wit that did the soul o’ercome, 
Is buried all in Strephon’s worshipped tomb; 
Satire has lost its art, its sting is gone, 
The Fop and Cully now may be undone; 
That dear instructing rage is now allayed, 
And no sharp pen dares tell ’em how they’ve strayed; 
Bold as a god was ev’ry lash he took, 
But kind and gentle the chastizing stroke. 
    Mourn, mourn, ye youths, whom fortune has betrayed, 
    The last reproacher of your vice is dead. 
Mourn, all ye beauties, put your Cyprus on, 
The truest swain that e’re adored you’s gone; 
Think how he loved, and writ, and sighed, and spoke, 
Recall his mien, his fashion, and his look. 
By what dear arts the soul he did surprise, 
Soft as his voice, and charming as his eyes. 
Bring garlands all of never-dying flowers, 
Bedewed with everlasting falling showers; 
Fix your fair eyes upon your victimed slave, 
Sent gay and young to his untimely grave. 
See where the noble swain extended lies, 
Too sad a triumph of your victories; 
Adorned with all the graces Heaven e’er lent, 
All that was great, soft, lovely, excellent 
You’ve laid into his early monument. 
    Mourn, mourn, ye beauties, your sad loss deplore, 
    The young, the charming Strephon is no more. 
 
Mourn, all ye little gods of love, whose darts 
Have lost their wonted power of piercing hearts; 
Lay by the gilded quiver and the bow, 
The useless toys can do no mischief now, 
Those eyes that all your arrows’ points inspired, 
Those lights that gave ye fire are now retired, 
Cold as his tomb, pale as your mother’s doves; 
Bewail him then oh all ye little loves, 
For you the humblest votary have lost 
That ever your divinities could boast; 
Upon your hands your weeping heads decline, 
And let your wings encompass round his shrine; 
In stead of flowers your broken arrows strow, 
And at his feet lay the neglected bow. 
         Mourn, all ye little gods, your loss deplore, 
         The soft, the charming Strephon is no more. 
 
Large was his fame, but short his glorious race, 
Like young Lucretius lived and died apace. 
So early roses fade, so over all 
They cast their fragrant scents, then softly fall, 
While all the scattered perfumed leaves declare, 
How lovely ’twas when whole, how sweet, how fair. 
Had he been to the Roman Empire known, 
When great Augustus filled the peaceful throne; 
Had he the noble wond’rous poet seen, 
And known his genius, and surveyed his mien, 
(When wits, and heroes graced divine abodes), 
He had increased the number of their gods; 
The royal judge had temples rear’d to’s name, 
And made him as immortal as his fame; 
In love and verse his Ovid he’ad out-done, 
And all his laurels, and his Julia won.

Daniel Defoe,1660–1731,from The True Born Englishman,"Thus from a mixture of all kinds began,
That het’rogeneous thing, an Englishman:
In eager rapes, and furious lust begot,
Betwixt a painted Britain and a Scot.
Whose gend’ring off-spring quickly learn’d to bow,
And yoke their heifers to the Roman plough:
From whence a mongrel half-bred race there came,
With neither name, nor nation, speech nor fame.
In whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran,
Infus’d betwixt a Saxon and a Dane.
While their rank daughters, to their parents just,
Receiv’d all nations with promiscuous lust.
This nauseous brood directly did contain
The well-extracted blood of Englishmen.

Which medly canton’d in a heptarchy,
A rhapsody of nations to supply,
Among themselves maintain’d eternal wars,
And still the ladies lov’d the conquerors.

The western Angles all the rest subdu’d;
A bloody nation, barbarous and rude:
Who by the tenure of the sword possest
One part of Britain, and subdu’d the rest
And as great things denominate the small,
The conqu’ring part gave title to the whole.
The Scot, Pict, Britain, Roman, Dane, submit,
And with the English-Saxon all unite:
And these the mixture have so close pursu’d,
The very name and memory’s subdu’d:
No Roman now, no Britain does remain;
Wales strove to separate, but strove in vain:
The silent nations undistinguish’d fall,
And Englishman’s the common name for all.
Fate jumbled them together, God knows how;
What e’er they were they’re true-born English now.

The wonder which remains is at our pride,
To value that which all wise men deride.
For Englishmen to boast of generation,
Cancels their knowledge, and lampoons the nation.
A true-born Englishman’s a contradiction,
In speech an irony, in fact a fiction.
A banter made to be a test of fools,
Which those that use it justly ridicules.
A metaphor invented to express
A man a-kin to all the universe.

For as the Scots, as learned men ha’ said,
Throughout the world their wand’ring seed ha’ spread;
So open-handed England, ’tis believ’d,
Has all the gleanings of the world receiv’d.

Some think of England ’twas our Saviour meant,
The Gospel should to all the world be sent:
Since, when the blessed sound did hither reach,
They to all nations might be said to preach.

’Tis well that virtue gives nobility,
How shall we else the want of birth and blood supply?
Since scarce one family is left alive,
Which does not from some foreigner derive.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44081/the-true-born-englishman,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/daniel-defoe,,1660.0,1731.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Countess of Winchilsea Anne Finch,1661–1720,The Tree,"Fair tree! for thy delightful shade
'Tis just that some return be made;
Sure some return is due from me
To thy cool shadows, and to thee.
When thou to birds dost shelter give,
Thou music dost from them receive;
If travellers beneath thee stay
Till storms have worn themselves away,
That time in praising thee they spend
And thy protecting pow'r commend.
The shepherd here, from scorching freed,
Tunes to thy dancing leaves his reed;
Whilst his lov'd nymph, in thanks, bestows
Her flow'ry chaplets on thy boughs.
Shall I then only silent be,
And no return be made by me?
No; let this wish upon thee wait,
And still to flourish be thy fate.
To future ages may'st thou stand
Untouch'd by the rash workman's hand,
Till that large stock of sap is spent,
Which gives thy summer's ornament;
Till the fierce winds, that vainly strive
To shock thy greatness whilst alive,
Shall on thy lifeless hour attend,
Prevent the axe, and grace thy end;
Their scatter'd strength together call
And to the clouds proclaim thy fall;
Who then their ev'ning dews may spare
When thou no longer art their care,
But shalt, like ancient heroes, burn,
And some bright hearth be made thy urn.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44243/the-tree-56d223423328c,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-finch,,1661.0,1720.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

The slip-shod 'prentice from his master's door 
Had par'd the dirt, and sprinkled round the floor. 
Now Moll had whirl'd her mop with dext'rous airs, 
Prepar'd to scrub the entry and the stairs.

The kennel-edge, where wheels had worn the place. 
The small-coal man was heard with cadence deep;

Duns at his lordship's gate began to meet; 
And brickdust Moll had scream'd through half a street.

Jonathan Swift,1667–1745,"Stella's Birthday March 13, 1727","This day, whate'er the Fates decree, 
Shall still be kept with joy by me: 
This day then let us not be told, 
That you are sick, and I grown old; 
Nor think on our approaching ills, 
And talk of spectacles and pills. 
To-morrow will be time enough 
To hear such mortifying stuff. 
Yet, since from reason may be brought 
A better and more pleasing thought, 
Which can, in spite of all decays, 
Support a few remaining days: 
From not the gravest of divines 
Accept for once some serious lines. 
 
         Although we now can form no more 
Long schemes of life, as heretofore; 
Yet you, while time is running fast, 
Can look with joy on what is past. 
 
         Were future happiness and pain 
A mere contrivance of the brain, 
As atheists argue, to entice 
And fit their proselytes for vice; 
(The only comfort they propose, 
To have companions in their woes;) 
Grant this the case; yet sure 'tis hard 
That virtue, styl'd its own reward, 
And by all sages understood 
To be the chief of human good, 
Should, acting, die, nor leave behind 
Some lasting pleasure in the mind; 
Which by remembrance will assuage 
Grief, sickness, poverty, and age; 
And strongly shoot a radiant dart 
To shine through life's declining part. 
 
         Say, Stella, feel you no content, 
Reflecting on a life well spent? 
Your skilful hand employ'd to save 
Despairing wretches from the grave; 
And then supporting with your store 
Those whom you dragg'd from death before? 
So Providence on mortals waits, 
Preserving what it first creates. 
Your gen'rous boldness to defend 
An innocent and absent friend; 
That courage which can make you just 
To merit humbled in the dust; 
The detestation you express 
For vice in all its glitt'ring dress; 
That patience under torturing pain, 
Where stubborn stoics would complain: 
Must these like empty shadows pass, 
Or forms reflected from a glass? 
Or mere chimæras in the mind, 
That fly, and leave no marks behind? 
Does not the body thrive and grow 
By food of twenty years ago? 
And, had it not been still supplied, 
It must a thousand times have died. 
Then who with reason can maintain 
That no effects of food remain? 
And is not virtue in mankind 
The nutriment that feeds the mind; 
Upheld by each good action past, 
And still continued by the last? 
Then, who with reason can pretend 
That all effects of virtue end? 
 
         Believe me, Stella, when you show 
That true contempt for things below, 
Nor prize your life for other ends, 
Than merely to oblige your friends; 
Your former actions claim their part, 
And join to fortify your heart. 
For Virtue, in her daily race, 
Like Janus, bears a double face; 
Looks back with joy where she has gone 
And therefore goes with courage on: 
She at your sickly couch will wait, 
And guide you to a better state. 
 
         O then, whatever Heav'n intends, 
Take pity on your pitying friends! 
Nor let your ills affect your mind, 
To fancy they can be unkind. 
Me, surely me, you ought to spare, 
Who gladly would your suff'rings share; 
Or give my scrap of life to you, 
And think it far beneath your due; 
You, to whose care so oft I owe 
That I'm alive to tell you so.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Couplet']","Source:

Jonathan Swift,1667–1745,The Beasts' Confession,"To the Priest, on Observing how most Men mistake their own Talents

When beasts could speak (the learned say, 
They still can do so ev'ry day), 
It seems, they had religion then, 
As much as now we find in men. 
It happen'd, when a plague broke out 
(Which therefore made them more devout), 
The king of brutes (to make it plain, 
Of quadrupeds I only mean) 
By proclamation gave command, 
That ev'ry subject in the land 
Should to the priest confess their sins; 
And thus the pious wolf begins: 
 
       ""Good father, I must own with shame, 
That often I have been to blame: 
I must confess, on Friday last, 
Wretch that I was! I broke my fast: 
But I defy the basest tongue 
To prove I did my neighbour wrong; 
Or ever went to seek my food 
By rapine, theft, or thirst of blood."" 
 
       The ass, approaching next, confess'd 
That in his heart he lov'd a jest: 
A wag he was, he needs must own, 
And could not let a dunce alone: 
Sometimes his friend he would not spare, 
And might perhaps be too severe: 
But yet, the worst that could be said, 
He was a wit both born and bred; 
And, if it be a sin or shame, 
Nature alone must bear the blame: 
One fault he hath, is sorry for't, 
His ears are half a foot too short; 
Which could he to the standard bring, 
He'd show his face before the King: 
Then for his voice, there's none disputes 
That he's the nightingale of brutes. 
 
       The swine with contrite heart allow'd, 
His shape and beauty made him proud: 
In diet was perhaps too nice, 
But gluttony was ne'er his vice: 
In ev'ry turn of life content, 
And meekly took what fortune sent: 
Inquire through all the parish round, 
A better neighbour ne'er was found: 
His vigilance might some displease; 
'Tis true he hated sloth like peas. 
 
       The mimic ape began his chatter, 
How evil tongues his life bespatter: 
Much of the cens'ring world complain'd, 
Who said, his gravity was feign'd: 
Indeed, the strictness of his morals 
Engag'd him in a hundred quarrels: 
He saw, and he was griev'd to see't, 
His zeal was sometimes indiscreet: 
He found his virtues too severe 
For our corrupted times to bear: 
Yet, such a lewd licentious age 
Might well excuse a Stoic's rage. 
 
       The goat advanc'd with decent pace; 
And first excus'd his youthful face; 
Forgiveness begg'd that he appear'd 
('Twas nature's fault) without a beard. 
'Tis true, he was not much inclin'd 
To fondness for the female kind; 
Not, as his enemies object, 
From chance, or natural defect; 
Not by his frigid constitution, 
But through a pious resolution; 
For he had made a holy vow 
Of chastity as monks do now; 
Which he resolv'd to keep for ever hence, 
As strictly too, as doth his Reverence. 
 
       Apply the tale, and you shall find, 
How just it suits with human kind. 
Some faults we own: but, can you guess? 
Why?—virtues carried to excess, 
Wherewith our vanity endows us, 
Though neither foe nor friend allows us. 
 
       The lawyer swears, you may rely on't, 
He never squeez'd a needy client; 
And this he makes his constant rule, 
For which his brethren call him fool: 
His conscience always was so nice, 
He freely gave the poor advice; 
By which he lost, he may affirm, 
A hundred fees last Easter term. 
While others of the learned robe 
Would break the patience of a Job; 
No pleader at the bar could match 
His diligence and quick dispatch; 
Ne'er kept a cause, he well may boast, 
Above a term or two at most. 
 
       The cringing knave, who seeks a place 
Without success, thus tells his case: 
Why should he longer mince the matter? 
He fail'd because he could not flatter; 
He had not learn'd to turn his coat, 
Nor for a party give his vote: 
His crime he quickly understood; 
Too zealous for the nation's good: 
He found the ministers resent it, 
Yet could not for his heart repent it. 
 
       The chaplain vows he cannot fawn, 
Though it would raise him to the lawn: 
He pass'd his hours among his books; 
You find it in his meagre looks: 
He might, if he were worldly wise, 
Preferment get and spare his eyes: 
But own'd he had a stubborn spirit, 
That made him trust alone in merit: 
Would rise by merit to promotion; 
Alas! a mere chimeric notion. 
 
       The doctor, if you will believe him, 
Confess'd a sin; and God forgive him! 
Call'd up at midnight, ran to save 
A blind old beggar from the grave: 
But see how Satan spreads his snares; 
He quite forgot to say his prayers. 
He cannot help it for his heart 
Sometimes to act the parson's part: 
Quotes from the Bible many a sentence, 
That moves his patients to repentance: 
And, when his med'cines do no good, 
Supports their minds with heav'nly food, 
At which, however well intended, 
He hears the clergy are offended; 
And grown so bold behind his back, 
To call him hypocrite and quack. 
In his own church he keeps a seat; 
Says grace before and after meat; 
And calls, without affecting airs, 
His household twice a day to prayers. 
He shuns apothecaries' shops; 
And hates to cram the sick with slops: 
He scorns to make his art a trade; 
Nor bribes my lady's fav'rite maid. 
Old nurse-keepers would never hire 
To recommend him to the squire; 
Which others, whom he will not name, 
Have often practis'd to their shame. 
 
       The statesman tells you with a sneer, 
His fault is to be too sincere; 
And, having no sinister ends, 
Is apt to disoblige his friends. 
The nation's good, his master's glory, 
Without regard to Whig or Tory, 
Were all the schemes he had in view; 
Yet he was seconded by few: 
Though some had spread a hundred lies, 
'Twas  he defeated the Excise. 
'Twas known, though he had borne aspersion, 
That standing troops were his aversion: 
His practice was, in ev'ry station, 
To serve the King, and please the nation. 
Though hard to find in ev'ry case 
The fittest man to fill a place: 
His promises he ne'er forgot, 
But took memorials on the spot: 
His enemies, for want of charity, 
Said he affected popularity: 
'Tis true, the people understood, 
That all he did was for their good; 
Their kind affections he has tried; 
No love is lost on either side. 
He came to Court with fortune clear, 
Which now he runs out ev'ry year: 
Must, at the rate that he goes on, 
Inevitably be undone: 
Oh! if his Majesty would please 
To give him but a writ of ease, 
Would grant him licence to retire, 
As it hath long been his desire, 
By fair accounts it would be found, 
He's poorer by ten thousand pound. 
He owns, and hopes it is no sin, 
He ne'er was partial to his kin; 
He thought it base for men in stations 
To crowd the Court with their relations; 
His country was his dearest mother, 
And ev'ry virtuous man his brother; 
Through modesty or awkward shame 
(For which he owns himself to blame), 
He found the wisest man he could, 
Without respect to friends or blood; 
Nor ever acts on private views, 
When he hath liberty to choose. 
 
       The sharper swore he hated play, 
Except to pass an hour away: 
And well he might; for, to his cost, 
By want of skill he always lost; 
He heard there was a club of cheats, 
Who had contriv'd a thousand feats; 
Could change the stock, or cog a die, 
And thus deceive the sharpest eye: 
Nor wonder how his fortune sunk, 
His brothers fleece him when he's drunk. 
 
       I own the moral not exact; 
Besides, the tale is false in fact; 
And so absurd, that could I raise up 
From fields Elysian fabling Aesop; 
I would accuse him to his face 
For libelling the four-foot race. 
Creatures of ev'ry kind but ours 
Well comprehend their natural pow'rs; 
While we, whom reason ought to sway, 
Mistake our talents ev'ry day. 
The ass was never known so stupid 
To act the part of Tray or Cupid; 
Nor leaps upon his master's lap, 
There to be strok'd, and fed with pap, 
As Aesop would the world persuade; 
He better understands his trade: 
Nor comes, whene'er his lady whistles; 
But carries loads, and feeds on thistles. 
Our author's meaning, I presume, is 
A creature bipes et implumis; 
Wherein the moralist design'd 
A compliment on human kind: 
For here he owns, that now and then 
Beasts may degenerate into men.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Pets', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45265/the-beasts-confession,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/jonathan-swift,,1667.0,1745.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Jonathan Swift,1667–1745,"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift, D.S.P.D.","Dans l'adversité de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons quelque chose, qui ne nous déplaît pas. 
[""In the hard times of our best friends we find something that doesn't displease us.""] 


As Rochefoucauld his maxims drew 
From Nature, I believe 'em true: 
They argue no corrupted mind 
In him; the fault is in mankind. 
 
       This maxim more than all the rest 
Is thought too base for human breast: 
""In all distresses of our friends, 
We first consult our private ends; 
 
While Nature, kindly bent to ease us, 
Points out some circumstance to please us."" 
 
       If this perhaps your patience move, 
Let reason and experience prove. 
 
       We all behold with envious eyes 
Our equal rais'd above our size. 
Who would not at a crowded show 
Stand high himself, keep others low? 
I love my friend as well as you 
But would not have him stop my view. 
Then let him have the higher post: 
I ask but for an inch at most. 
 
       If in a battle you should find 
One, whom you love of all mankind, 
Had some heroic action done, 
A champion kill'd, or trophy won; 
Rather than thus be overtopt, 
Would you not wish his laurels cropt? 
 
       Dear honest Ned is in the gout, 
Lies rack'd with pain, and you without: 
How patiently you hear him groan! 
How glad the case is not your own! 
 
       What poet would not grieve to see 
His brethren write as well as he? 
But rather than they should excel, 
He'd wish his rivals all in hell. 
 
       Her end when emulation misses, 
She turns to envy, stings and hisses: 
The strongest friendship yields to pride, 
Unless the odds be on our side. 
 
       Vain human kind! fantastic race! 
Thy various follies who can trace? 
Self-love, ambition, envy, pride, 
Their empire in our hearts divide. 
Give others riches, power, and station, 
'Tis all on me a usurpation. 
I have no title to aspire; 
Yet, when you sink, I seem the higher. 
In Pope I cannot read a line, 
But with a sigh I wish it mine; 
When he can in one couplet fix 
More sense than I can do in six; 
It gives me such a jealous fit, 
I cry, ""Pox take him and his wit!"" 
 
       Why must I be outdone by Gay 
In my own hum'rous biting way? 
 
       Arbuthnot is no more my friend, 
Who dares to irony pretend, 
Which I was born to introduce, 
Refin'd it first, and show'd its use. 
 
       St. John, as well as Pultney, knows 
That I had some repute for prose; 
And, till they drove me out of date, 
Could maul a minister of state. 
If they have mortify'd my pride, 
And made me throw my pen aside; 
If with such talents Heav'n has blest 'em, 
Have I not reason to detest 'em? 
 
       To all my foes, dear Fortune, send 
Thy gifts; but never to my friend: 
I tamely can endure the first, 
But this with envy makes me burst. 
 
       Thus much may serve by way of proem: 
Proceed we therefore to our poem. 
 
       The time is not remote, when I 
Must by the course of nature die; 
When I foresee my special friends 
Will try to find their private ends: 
Tho' it is hardly understood 
Which way my death can do them good, 
Yet thus, methinks, I hear 'em speak: 
""See, how the Dean begins to break! 
Poor gentleman, he droops apace! 
You plainly find it in his face. 
That old vertigo in his head 
Will never leave him till he's dead. 
Besides, his memory decays: 
He recollects not what he says; 
He cannot call his friends to mind: 
Forgets the place where last he din'd; 
Plies you with stories o'er and o'er; 
He told them fifty times before. 
How does he fancy we can sit 
To hear his out-of-fashion'd wit? 
But he takes up with younger folks, 
Who for his wine will bear his jokes. 
Faith, he must make his stories shorter, 
Or change his comrades once a quarter: 
In half the time he talks them round, 
There must another set be found. 
 
       ""For poetry he's past his prime: 
He takes an hour to find a rhyme; 
His fire is out, his wit decay'd, 
His fancy sunk, his Muse a jade. 
I'd have him throw away his pen;— 
But there's no talking to some men!"" 
 
       And then their tenderness appears, 
By adding largely to my years: 
""He's older than he would be reckon'd 
And well remembers Charles the Second. 
 
       ""He hardly drinks a pint of wine; 
And that, I doubt, is no good sign. 
His stomach too begins to fail: 
Last year we thought him strong and hale; 
But now he's quite another thing: 
I wish he may hold out till spring."" 
 
       Then hug themselves, and reason thus: 
""It is not yet so bad with us."" 
 
       In such a case, they talk in tropes, 
And by their fears express their hopes: 
Some great misfortune to portend, 
No enemy can match a friend. 
With all the kindness they profess, 
The merit of a lucky guess 
(When daily ""How d'ye's"" come of course, 
And servants answer, ""Worse and worse!"") 
Would please 'em better, than to tell, 
That, ""God be prais'd, the Dean is well."" 
Then he who prophecy'd the best 
Approves his foresight to the rest: 
""You know I always fear'd the worst, 
And often told you so at first."" 
He'd rather choose that I should die, 
Than his prediction prove a lie. 
Not one foretells I shall recover; 
But all agree to give me over. 
 
       Yet, should some neighbour feel a pain 
Just in the parts where I complain, 
How many a message would he send? 
What hearty prayers that I should mend? 
Inquire what regimen I kept, 
What gave me ease, and how I slept? 
And more lament when I was dead, 
Than all the sniv'llers round my bed. 
 
       My good companions, never fear; 
For though you may mistake a year, 
Though your prognostics run too fast, 
They must be verify'd at last. 
 
       Behold the fatal day arrive! 
""How is the Dean?""—""He's just alive."" 
Now the departing prayer is read; 
""He hardly breathes.""—""The Dean is dead."" 
Before the passing-bell begun, 
The news thro' half the town has run. 
""O, may we all for death prepare! 
What has he left? and who's his heir?""— 
""I know no more than what the news is; 
'Tis all bequeath'd to public uses.""— 
""To public use! a perfect whim! 
What had the public done for him? 
Mere envy, avarice, and pride: 
He gave it all—but first he died. 
And had the Dean, in all the nation, 
No worthy friend, no poor relation? 
So ready to do strangers good, 
Forgetting his own flesh and blood?"" 
 
       Now Grub-Street wits are all employ'd; 
With elegies the town is cloy'd: 
Some paragraph in ev'ry paper 
To curse the Dean or bless the Drapier. 
 
       The doctors, tender of their fame, 
Wisely on me lay all the blame: 
""We must confess his case was nice; 
But he would never take advice. 
Had he been rul'd, for aught appears, 
He might have liv'd these twenty years; 
For, when we open'd him, we found 
That all his vital parts were sound."" 
 
       From Dublin soon to London spread, 
'Tis told at Court, the Dean is dead. 
 
       Kind Lady Suffolk in the spleen 
Runs laughing up to tell the Queen. 
The Queen, so gracious, mild, and good, 
Cries, ""Is he gone! 'tis time he should. 
He's dead, you say; why, let him rot: 
I'm glad the medals were forgot. 
I promis'd them, I own; but when? 
I only was the Princess then; 
But now, as consort of a king, 
You know, 'tis quite a different thing."" 
 
       Now Chartres, at Sir Robert's levee, 
Tells with a sneer the tidings heavy: 
""Why, is he dead without his shoes?"" 
Cries Bob, ""I'm sorry for the news: 
O, were the wretch but living still, 
And in his place my good friend Will! 
Or had a mitre on his head, 
Provided Bolingbroke were dead!"" 
 
       Now Curll his shop from rubbish drains: 
Three genuine tomes of Swift's remains! 
And then, to make them pass the glibber, 
Revis'd by Tibbalds, Moore, and Cibber. 
He'll treat me as he does my betters, 
Publish my will, my life, my letters: 
Revive the libels born to die; 
Which Pope must bear, as well as I. 
 
       Here shift the scene, to represent 
How those I love my death lament. 
Poor Pope will grieve a month, and Gay 
A week, and Arbuthnot a day. 
 
       St. John himself will scarce forbear 
To bite his pen, and drop a tear. 
The rest will give a shrug, and cry, 
""I'm sorry—but we all must die!"" 
Indifference, clad in Wisdom's guise, 
All fortitude of mind supplies: 
For how can stony bowels melt 
In those who never pity felt? 
When  we are lash'd,  they kiss the rod, 
Resigning to the will of God. 
 
       The fools, my juniors by a year, 
Are tortur'd with suspense and fear; 
Who wisely thought my age a screen, 
When death approach'd, to stand between: 
The screen remov'd, their hearts are trembling; 
They mourn for me without dissembling. 
 
       My female friends, whose tender hearts 
Have better learn'd to act their parts, 
Receive the news in doleful dumps: 
""The Dean is dead: (and what is trumps?) 
Then, Lord have mercy on his soul! 
(Ladies, I'll venture for the vole.) 
Six deans, they say, must bear the pall: 
(I wish I knew what king to call.) 
Madam, your husband will attend 
The funeral of so good a friend. 
No, madam, 'tis a shocking sight: 
And he's engag'd to-morrow night: 
My Lady Club would take it ill, 
If he should fail her at quadrille. 
He lov'd the Dean—(I lead a heart) 
But dearest friends, they say, must part. 
His time was come: he ran his race; 
We hope he's in a better place."" 
 
       Why do we grieve that friends should die? 
No loss more easy to supply. 
One year is past; a different scene! 
No further mention of the Dean; 
Who now, alas! no more is miss'd, 
Than if he never did exist. 
Where's now this fav'rite of Apollo! 
Departed:—and his works must follow; 
Must undergo the common fate; 
His kind of wit is out of date. 
Some country squire to Lintot goes, 
Inquires for ""Swift in Verse and Prose."" 
Says Lintot, ""I have heard the name; 
He died a year ago.""—""The same."" 
He searcheth all his shop in vain. 
""Sir, you may find them in Duck-lane; 
I sent them with a load of books, 
Last Monday to the pastry-cook's. 
To fancy they could live a year! 
I find you're but a stranger here. 
The Dean was famous in his time, 
And had a kind of knack at rhyme. 
His way of writing now is past; 
The town hath got a better taste; 
I keep no antiquated stuff, 
But spick and span I have enough. 
Pray do but give me leave to show 'em; 
Here's Colley Cibber's birth-day poem. 
This ode you never yet have seen, 
By Stephen Duck, upon the Queen. 
Then here's a letter finely penn'd 
Against the  Craftsman and his friend: 
It clearly shows that all reflection 
On ministers is disaffection. 
Next, here's Sir Robert's vindication, 
And Mr. Henley's last oration. 
The hawkers have not got 'em yet: 
Your honour please to buy a set? 
 
       ""Here's Woolston's tracts, the twelfth edition; 
'Tis read by every politician: 
The country members, when in town, 
To all their boroughs send them down; 
You never met a thing so smart; 
The courtiers have them all by heart: 
Those maids of honour who can read 
Are taught to use them for their creed. 
The rev'rend author's good intention 
Hath been rewarded with a pension. 
He doth an honour to his gown, 
By bravely running priestcraft down: 
He shows, as sure as God's in Gloucester, 
That Jesus was a grand imposter; 
That all his miracles were cheats, 
Perform'd as jugglers do their feats: 
The church had never such a writer; 
A shame he hath not got a mitre!"" 
 
       Suppose me dead; and then suppose 
A club assembled at the  Rose ; 
Where, from discourse of this and that, 
I grow the subject of their chat. 
And while they toss my name about, 
With favour some, and some without, 
One, quite indiff'rent in the cause, 
My character impartial draws: 
 
       ""The Dean, if we believe report, 
Was never ill receiv'd at Court. 
As for his works in verse and prose 
I own myself no judge of those; 
Nor can I tell what critics thought 'em: 
But this I know, all people bought 'em. 
As with a moral view design'd 
To cure the vices of mankind: 
His vein, ironically grave, 
Expos'd the fool, and lash'd the knave. 
To steal a hint was never known, 
But what he writ was all his own. 
 
       ""He never thought an honour done him, 
Because a duke was proud to own him, 
Would rather slip aside and choose 
To talk with wits in dirty shoes; 
Despis'd the fools with stars and garters, 
So often seen caressing Chartres. 
He never courted men in station, 
Nor persons held in admiration; 
Of no man's greatness was afraid, 
Because he sought for no man's aid. 
Though trusted long in great affairs 
He gave himself no haughty airs: 
Without regarding private ends, 
Spent all his credit for his friends; 
And only chose the wise and good; 
No flatt'rers; no allies in blood: 
But succour'd virtue in distress, 
And seldom fail'd of good success; 
As numbers in their hearts must own, 
Who, but for him, had been unknown. 
 
       ""With princes kept a due decorum, 
But never stood in awe before 'em. 
He follow'd David's lesson just: 
'In princes never put thy trust'; 
And, would you make him truly sour, 
Provoke him with a slave in pow'r. 
The Irish senate if you nam'd, 
With what impatience he declaim'd! 
Fair Liberty was all his cry, 
For her he stood prepar'd to die; 
For her he boldly stood alone; 
For her he oft expos'd his own. 
Two kingdoms, just as faction led, 
Had set a price upon his head; 
But not a traitor could be found 
To sell him for six hundred pound. 
 
       ""Had he but spar'd his tongue and pen 
He might have rose like other men: 
But pow'r was never in his thought, 
And wealth he valu'd not a groat: 
Ingratitude he often found, 
And pity'd those who meant the wound: 
But kept the tenor of his mind, 
To merit well of human kind: 
Nor made a sacrifice of those 
Who still were true, to please his foes. 
He labour'd many a fruitless hour 
To reconcile his friends in pow'r; 
Saw mischief by a faction brewing, 
While they pursu'd each other's ruin. 
But, finding vain was all his care, 
He left the Court in mere despair. 
 
       ""And, oh! how short are human schemes! 
Here ended all our golden dreams. 
What St. John's skill in state affairs, 
What Ormond's valour, Oxford's cares, 
To save their sinking country lent, 
Was all destroy'd by one event. 
Too soon that precious life was ended, 
On which alone our weal depended. 
When up a dangerous faction starts, 
With wrath and vengeance in their hearts; 
By solemn League and Cov'nant bound, 
To ruin, slaughter, and confound; 
To turn religion to a fable, 
And make the government a Babel; 
Pervert the law, disgrace the gown, 
Corrupt the senate, rob the crown; 
To sacrifice old England's glory, 
And make her infamous in story: 
When such a tempest shook the land, 
How could unguarded Virtue stand? 
 
       ""With horror, grief, despair, the Dean 
Beheld the dire destructive scene: 
His friends in exile, or the tower, 
Himself within the frown of power, 
Pursu'd by base envenom'd pens, 
Far to the land of slaves and fens; 
A servile race in folly nurs'd, 
Who truckle most when treated worst. 
 
       ""By innocence and resolution, 
He bore continual persecution, 
While numbers to preferment rose, 
Whose merits were, to be his foes; 
When ev'n his own familiar friends, 
Intent upon their private ends, 
Like renegadoes now he feels, 
Against him lifting up their heels. 
 
       ""The Dean did by his pen defeat 
An infamous destructive cheat; 
Taught fools their int'rest how to know, 
And gave them arms to ward the blow. 
Envy hath own'd it was his doing, 
To save that helpless land from ruin; 
While they who at the steerage stood, 
And reap'd the profit, sought his blood. 
 
       ""To save them from their evil fate, 
In him was held a crime of state. 
A wicked monster on the bench, 
Whose fury blood could never quench, 
As vile and profligate a villain, 
As modern Scroggs, or old Tresilian, 
Who long all justice had discarded, 
Nor fear'd he God, nor man regarded, 
Vow'd on the Dean his rage to vent, 
And make him of his zeal repent; 
But Heav'n his innocence defends, 
The grateful people stand his friends. 
Not strains of law, nor judge's frown, 
Nor topics brought to please the crown, 
Nor witness hir'd, nor jury pick'd, 
Prevail to bring him in convict. 
 
       ""In exile, with a steady heart, 
He spent his life's declining part; 
Where folly, pride, and faction sway, 
Remote from St. John, Pope, and Gay. 
 
       ""His friendships there, to few confin'd, 
Were always of the middling kind; 
No fools of rank, a mongrel breed, 
Who fain would pass for lords indeed: 
Where titles gave no right or power 
And peerage is a wither'd flower; 
He would have held it a disgrace, 
If such a wretch had known his face. 
On rural squires, that kingdom's bane, 
He vented oft his wrath in vain; 
Biennial squires to market brought; 
Who sell their souls and votes for nought; 
The nation stripp'd, go joyful back, 
To rob the church, their tenants rack, 
Go snacks with thieves and rapparees, 
And keep the peace to pick up fees; 
In ev'ry job to have a share, 
A jail or barrack to repair; 
And turn the tax for public roads, 
Commodious to their own abodes. 
 
       ""Perhaps I may allow, the Dean 
Had too much satire in his vein; 
And seem'd determin'd not to starve it, 
Because no age could more deserve it. 
Yet malice never was his aim; 
He lash'd the vice, but spar'd the name; 
No individual could resent, 
Where thousands equally were meant. 
His satire points at no defect, 
But what all mortals may correct; 
For he abhorr'd that senseless tribe 
Who call it humour when they gibe. 
He spar'd a hump, or crooked nose, 
Whose owners set not up for beaux. 
True genuine dulness mov'd his pity, 
Unless it offer'd to be witty. 
Those who their ignorance confess'd 
He ne'er offended with a jest; 
But laugh'd to hear an idiot quote 
A verse from Horace, learn'd by rote. 
 
       ""He knew a hundred pleasant stories 
With all the turns of Whigs and Tories: 
Was cheerful to his dying day; 
And friends would let him have his way. 
 
       ""He gave the little wealth he had 
To build a house for fools and mad; 
And show'd by one satiric touch, 
No nation wanted it so much. 
That kingdom he hath left his debtor, 
I wish it soon may have a better.""",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45272/verses-on-the-death-of-dr-swift-dspd,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/jonathan-swift,,1667.0,1745.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Henry Carey,1687–1743,The Ballad of Sally in our Alley,"The ARGUMENT.

A Vulgar Error having long prevailed among many Persons, who imagine Sally Salisbury the Subject of this Ballad, the Author begs leave to undeceive and assure them it has not the least allusion to her, he being a stranger to her very Name at the time this Song was composed. For as Innocence and Virtue were ever the Boundaries of his Muse, so in this little Poem he had no other view than to set forth the Beauty of a chaste and disinterested Passion, even in the lowest Class of human Life. The real Occasion was this: A Shoemaker’s ’Prentice making Holiday with his Sweet-heart, treated her with a sight of Bedlam, the Puppet-shews, the Flying-chairs, and all the Elegancies of the Moorfields: From whence proceeding to the Farthing Pye-house, he gave her a Collation of Buns, Cheesecakes, Gammon of Bacon, Stuff’d-beef, and Bottled-ale; through all which Scenes the Author dodged them (charm’d with the Simplicity of their Courtship), from whence he drew this little Sketch of Nature; but being then young and obscure, he was very much ridicul’d by some of his Acquaintance for this Performance; which nevertheless made its way into the polite World, and amply recompenced him by the Applause of the divine Addison, who was pleased (more than once) to mention it with Approbation.

Of all the Girls that are so smart
    There’s none like pretty SALLY,
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.
There is no Lady in the Land
    Is half so sweet as SALLY,
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.

Her Father he makes Cabbage-nets,
    And through the Streets does cry ’em;
Her Mother she sells Laces long,
    To such as please to buy ’em:
But sure such Folks could ne’er beget
    So sweet a Girl as SALLY!
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.

When she is by I leave my Work,
    (I love her so sincerely)
My Master comes like any Turk,
    And bangs me most severely;
But, let him bang his Belly full,
    I’ll bear it all for SALLY;
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.

Of all the Days that’s in the Week,
    I dearly love but one Day,
And that’s the Day that comes betwixt
    A Saturday and Monday;
For then I’m drest, all in my best,
    To walk abroad with SALLY;
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.

My Master carries me to Church,
    And often am I blamed,
Because I leave him in the lurch,
    As soon as Text is named:
I leave the Church in Sermon time,
    And slink away to SALLY;
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.

When Christmas comes about again,
    O then I shall have Money;
I’ll hoard it up, and Box and all
    I’ll give it to my Honey:
And, would it were ten thousand Pounds;
    I’d give it all to SALLY;
She is the Darling of my Heart,
    And she lives in our Alley.

My Master and the Neighbours all,
    Make game of me and SALLY;
And (but for her) I’d better be
    A Slave and row a Galley:
But when my seven long Years are out,
    O then I’ll marry SALLY!
O then we’ll wed and then we’ll bed,
    But not in our Alley.",ballad,verse forms,"['Love', 'Classic Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Ballad']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43884/the-ballad-of-sally-in-our-alley,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-carey,,1687.0,1743.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Alexander Pope,1688–1744,An Essay on Criticism: Part 1,"Si quid novisti rectius istis,
Candidus imperti; si non, his utere mecum
[If you have come to know any precept more correct than these, share it with me, brilliant one; if not, use these with me] (Horace, Epistle I.6.67)


PART 1
'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
Appear in writing or in judging ill;
But, of the two, less dang'rous is th' offence
To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
Some few in that, but numbers err in this,
Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;
A fool might once himself alone expose,
Now one in verse makes many more in prose.

    'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none
Go just alike, yet each believes his own.
In poets as true genius is but rare,
True taste as seldom is the critic's share;
Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light,
These born to judge, as well as those to write.
Let such teach others who themselves excel,
And censure freely who have written well.
Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,
But are not critics to their judgment too?

    Yet if we look more closely we shall find
Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind;
Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light;
The lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.
But as the slightest sketch, if justly trac'd,
Is by ill colouring but the more disgrac'd,
So by false learning is good sense defac'd;
Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,
And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.
In search of wit these lose their common sense,
And then turn critics in their own defence:
Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,
Or with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.
All fools have still an itching to deride,
And fain would be upon the laughing side.
If Mævius scribble in Apollo's spite,
There are, who judge still worse than he can write.

    Some have at first for wits, then poets pass'd,
Turn'd critics next, and prov'd plain fools at last;
Some neither can for wits nor critics pass,
As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.
Those half-learn'd witlings, num'rous in our isle
As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile;
Unfinish'd things, one knows not what to call,
Their generation's so equivocal:
To tell 'em, would a hundred tongues require,
Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.

    But you who seek to give and merit fame,
And justly bear a critic's noble name,
Be sure your self and your own reach to know,
How far your genius, taste, and learning go;
Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,
And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.

    Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,
And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit:
As on the land while here the ocean gains,
In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;
Thus in the soul while memory prevails,
The solid pow'r of understanding fails;
Where beams of warm imagination play,
The memory's soft figures melt away.
One science only will one genius fit;
So vast is art, so narrow human wit:
Not only bounded to peculiar arts,
But oft in those, confin'd to single parts.
Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before,
By vain ambition still to make them more;
Each might his sev'ral province well command,
Would all but stoop to what they understand.

    First follow NATURE, and your judgment frame
By her just standard, which is still the same:
Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,
One clear, unchang'd, and universal light,
Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,
At once the source, and end, and test of art.
Art from that fund each just supply provides,
Works without show, and without pomp presides:
In some fair body thus th' informing soul
With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,
Each motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains;
Itself unseen, but in th' effects, remains.
Some, to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse,
Want as much more, to turn it to its use;
For wit and judgment often are at strife,
Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife.
'Tis more to guide, than spur the Muse's steed;
Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;
The winged courser, like a gen'rous horse,
Shows most true mettle when you check his course.

    Those RULES of old discover'd, not devis'd,
Are Nature still, but Nature methodis'd;
Nature, like liberty, is but restrain'd
By the same laws which first herself ordain'd.

    Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,
When to repress, and when indulge our flights:
High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,
And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;
Held from afar, aloft, th' immortal prize,
And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise.
Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n,
She drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n.
The gen'rous critic fann'd the poet's fire,
And taught the world with reason to admire.
Then criticism the Muse's handmaid prov'd,
To dress her charms, and make her more belov'd;
But following wits from that intention stray'd;
Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;
Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,
Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.
So modern 'pothecaries, taught the art
By doctor's bills to play the doctor's part,
Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,
Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.
Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,
Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they:
Some drily plain, without invention's aid,
Write dull receipts how poems may be made:
These leave the sense, their learning to display,
And those explain the meaning quite away.

    You then whose judgment the right course would steer,
Know well each ANCIENT'S proper character;
His fable, subject, scope in ev'ry page;
Religion, country, genius of his age:
Without all these at once before your eyes,
Cavil you may, but never criticise.
Be Homer's works your study and delight,
Read them by day, and meditate by night;
Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,
And trace the Muses upward to their spring;
Still with itself compar'd, his text peruse;
And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.

    When first young Maro in his boundless mind
A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,
Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,
And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:
But when t' examine ev'ry part he came,
Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.
Convinc'd, amaz'd, he checks the bold design,
And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,
As if the Stagirite o'erlook'd each line.
Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;
To copy nature is to copy them.

    Some beauties yet, no precepts can declare,
For there's a happiness as well as care.
Music resembles poetry, in each
Are nameless graces which no methods teach,
And which a master-hand alone can reach.
If, where the rules not far enough extend,
(Since rules were made but to promote their end)
Some lucky LICENCE answers to the full
Th' intent propos'd, that licence is a rule.
Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,
May boldly deviate from the common track.
Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,
And rise to faults true critics dare not mend;
From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,
And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,
Which, without passing through the judgment, gains
The heart, and all its end at once attains.
In prospects, thus, some objects please our eyes,
Which out of nature's common order rise,
The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.
But tho' the ancients thus their rules invade,
(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)
Moderns, beware! or if you must offend
Against the precept, ne'er transgress its end;
Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need,
And have, at least, their precedent to plead.
The critic else proceeds without remorse,
Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.

    I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts
Those freer beauties, ev'n in them, seem faults.
Some figures monstrous and misshap'd appear,
Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,
Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,
Due distance reconciles to form and grace.
A prudent chief not always must display
His pow'rs in equal ranks, and fair array,
But with th' occasion and the place comply,
Conceal his force, nay seem sometimes to fly.
Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,
Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.

    Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,
Above the reach of sacrilegious hands,
Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,
Destructive war, and all-involving age.
See, from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!
Hear, in all tongues consenting pæans ring!
In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd,
And fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind!
Hail, bards triumphant! born in happier days;
Immortal heirs of universal praise!
Whose honours with increase of ages grow,
As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow!
Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,
And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!
Oh may some spark of your celestial fire
The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,
(That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights;
Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)
To teach vain wits a science little known,
T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Reading & Books', 'Social Commentaries', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44896/an-essay-on-criticism-part-1,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,An Essay on Criticism: Part 2,"Of all the causes which conspire to blind 
Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind, 
What the weak head with strongest bias rules, 
Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools. 
Whatever Nature has in worth denied, 
She gives in large recruits of needful pride; 
For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find 
What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind; 
Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence, 
And fills up all the mighty void of sense! 
If once right reason drives that cloud away, 
Truth breaks upon us with resistless day; 
Trust not yourself; but your defects to know, 
Make use of ev'ry friend—and ev'ry foe. 
 
       A little learning is a dang'rous thing; 
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring: 
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, 
And drinking largely sobers us again. 
Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts, 
In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts, 
While from the bounded level of our mind, 
Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind, 
But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise 
New, distant scenes of endless science rise! 
So pleas'd at first, the tow'ring Alps we try, 
Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky; 
Th' eternal snows appear already past, 
And the first clouds and mountains seem the last; 
But those attain'd, we tremble to survey 
The growing labours of the lengthen'd way, 
Th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes, 
Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise! 
 
       A perfect judge will read each work of wit 
With the same spirit that its author writ, 
Survey the whole, nor seek slight faults to find, 
Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind; 
Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight, 
The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit. 
But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow, 
Correctly cold, and regularly low, 
That shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep; 
We cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep. 
In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts 
Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts; 
'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call, 
But the joint force and full result of all. 
Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome, 
(The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!' 
No single parts unequally surprise; 
All comes united to th' admiring eyes; 
No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear; 
The whole at once is bold, and regular. 
 
       Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see, 
Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be. 
In ev'ry work regard the writer's end, 
Since none can compass more than they intend; 
And if the means be just, the conduct true, 
Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due. 
As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit, 
T' avoid great errors, must the less commit: 
Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays, 
For not to know such trifles, is a praise. 
Most critics, fond of some subservient art, 
Still make the whole depend upon a part: 
They talk of principles, but notions prize, 
And all to one lov'd folly sacrifice. 
 
       Once on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say, 
A certain bard encount'ring on the way, 
Discours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage, 
As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage; 
Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools, 
Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules. 
Our author, happy in a judge so nice, 
Produc'd his play, and begg'd the knight's advice, 
Made him observe the subject and the plot, 
The manners, passions, unities, what not? 
All which, exact to rule, were brought about, 
Were but a combat in the lists left out. 
""What! leave the combat out?"" exclaims the knight; 
""Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite."" 
""Not so by Heav'n"" (he answers in a rage) 
""Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage."" 
So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain. 
""Then build a new, or act it in a plain."" 
 
       Thus critics, of less judgment than caprice, 
Curious not knowing, not exact but nice, 
Form short ideas; and offend in arts 
(As most in manners) by a love to parts. 
 
       Some to conceit alone their taste confine, 
And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line; 
Pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit; 
One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit. 
Poets, like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace 
The naked nature and the living grace, 
With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part, 
And hide with ornaments their want of art. 
True wit is nature to advantage dress'd, 
What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd, 
Something, whose truth convinc'd at sight we find, 
That gives us back the image of our mind. 
As shades more sweetly recommend the light, 
So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit. 
For works may have more wit than does 'em good, 
As bodies perish through excess of blood. 
 
       Others for language all their care express, 
And value books, as women men, for dress: 
Their praise is still—""the style is excellent"": 
The sense, they humbly take upon content. 
Words are like leaves; and where they most abound, 
Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found. 
False eloquence, like the prismatic glass, 
Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place; 
The face of Nature we no more survey, 
All glares alike, without distinction gay: 
But true expression, like th' unchanging sun, 
Clears, and improves whate'er it shines upon, 
It gilds all objects, but it alters none. 
Expression is the dress of thought, and still 
Appears more decent, as more suitable; 
A vile conceit in pompous words express'd, 
Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd: 
For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort, 
As several garbs with country, town, and court. 
Some by old words to fame have made pretence, 
Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense; 
Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style, 
Amaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile. 
Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play, 
These sparks with awkward vanity display 
What the fine gentleman wore yesterday! 
And but so mimic ancient wits at best, 
As apes our grandsires, in their doublets dress'd. 
In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold; 
Alike fantastic, if too new, or old; 
Be not the first by whom the new are tried, 
Not yet the last to lay the old aside. 
 
       But most by numbers judge a poet's song; 
And smooth or rough, with them is right or wrong: 
In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire, 
Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire, 
Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear, 
Not mend their minds; as some to church repair, 
Not for the doctrine, but the music there. 
These equal syllables alone require, 
Tho' oft the ear the open vowels tire, 
While expletives their feeble aid do join, 
And ten low words oft creep in one dull line, 
While they ring round the same unvaried chimes, 
With sure returns of still expected rhymes. 
Where'er you find ""the cooling western breeze"", 
In the next line, it ""whispers through the trees"": 
If ""crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep"", 
The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with ""sleep"". 
Then, at the last and only couplet fraught 
With some unmeaning thing they call a thought, 
A needless Alexandrine ends the song, 
That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along. 
Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know 
What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow; 
And praise the easy vigour of a line, 
Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join. 
True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, 
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance. 
'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence, 
The sound must seem an echo to the sense. 
Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows, 
And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows; 
But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, 
The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar. 
When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, 
The line too labours, and the words move slow; 
Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain, 
Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main. 
Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise, 
And bid alternate passions fall and rise! 
While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove 
Now burns with glory, and then melts with love; 
Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow, 
Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow: 
Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found, 
And the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound! 
The pow'r of music all our hearts allow, 
And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now. 
 
       Avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such, 
Who still are pleas'd too little or too much. 
At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence, 
That always shows great pride, or little sense; 
Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best, 
Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest. 
Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move, 
For fools admire, but men of sense approve; 
As things seem large which we through mists descry, 
Dulness is ever apt to magnify. 
 
       Some foreign writers, some our own despise; 
The ancients only, or the moderns prize. 
Thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied 
To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside. 
Meanly they seek the blessing to confine, 
And force that sun but on a part to shine; 
Which not alone the southern wit sublimes, 
But ripens spirits in cold northern climes; 
Which from the first has shone on ages past, 
Enlights the present, and shall warm the last; 
(Though each may feel increases and decays, 
And see now clearer and now darker days.) 
Regard not then if wit be old or new, 
But blame the false, and value still the true. 
Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own, 
But catch the spreading notion of the town; 
They reason and conclude by precedent, 
And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent. 
Some judge of authors' names, not works, and then 
Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men. 
Of all this servile herd, the worst is he 
That in proud dulness joins with quality, 
A constant critic at the great man's board, 
To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord. 
What woeful stuff this madrigal would be, 
In some starv'd hackney sonneteer, or me? 
But let a Lord once own the happy lines, 
How the wit brightens! how the style refines! 
Before his sacred name flies every fault, 
And each exalted stanza teems with thought! 
 
       The vulgar thus through imitation err; 
As oft the learn'd by being singular; 
So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng 
By chance go right, they purposely go wrong: 
So Schismatics the plain believers quit, 
And are but damn'd for having too much wit. 
 
       Some praise at morning what they blame at night; 
But always think the last opinion right. 
A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd, 
This hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd; 
While their weak heads, like towns unfortified, 
Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side. 
Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say; 
And still tomorrow's wiser than today. 
We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow; 
Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so. 
Once school divines this zealous isle o'erspread; 
Who knew most Sentences, was deepest read; 
Faith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed, 
And none had sense enough to be confuted: 
Scotists and Thomists, now, in peace remain, 
Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck Lane. 
If Faith itself has different dresses worn, 
What wonder modes in wit should take their turn? 
Oft, leaving what is natural and fit, 
The current folly proves the ready wit; 
And authors think their reputation safe 
Which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh. 
 
       Some valuing those of their own side or mind, 
Still make themselves the measure of mankind; 
Fondly we think we honour merit then, 
When we but praise ourselves in other men. 
Parties in wit attend on those of state, 
And public faction doubles private hate. 
Pride, Malice, Folly, against Dryden rose, 
In various shapes of Parsons, Critics, Beaus; 
But sense surviv'd, when merry jests were past; 
For rising merit will buoy up at last. 
Might he return, and bless once more our eyes, 
New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise; 
Nay should great Homer lift his awful head, 
Zoilus again would start up from the dead. 
Envy will merit, as its shade, pursue, 
But like a shadow, proves the substance true; 
For envied wit, like Sol eclips'd, makes known 
Th' opposing body's grossness, not its own. 
When first that sun too powerful beams displays, 
It draws up vapours which obscure its rays; 
But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way, 
Reflect new glories, and augment the day. 
 
       Be thou the first true merit to befriend; 
His praise is lost, who stays till all commend. 
Short is the date, alas, of modern rhymes, 
And 'tis but just to let 'em live betimes. 
No longer now that golden age appears, 
When patriarch wits surviv'd a thousand years: 
Now length of Fame (our second life) is lost, 
And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast; 
Our sons their fathers' failing language see, 
And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be. 
So when the faithful pencil has design'd 
Some bright idea of the master's mind, 
Where a new world leaps out at his command, 
And ready Nature waits upon his hand; 
When the ripe colours soften and unite, 
And sweetly melt into just shade and light; 
When mellowing years their full perfection give, 
And each bold figure just begins to live, 
The treacherous colours the fair art betray, 
And all the bright creation fades away! 
 
       Unhappy wit, like most mistaken things, 
Atones not for that envy which it brings. 
In youth alone its empty praise we boast, 
But soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost: 
Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies, 
That gaily blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies. 
What is this wit, which must our cares employ? 
The owner's wife, that other men enjoy; 
Then most our trouble still when most admir'd, 
And still the more we give, the more requir'd; 
Whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease, 
Sure some to vex, but never all to please; 
'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun; 
By fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone! 
 
       If wit so much from ign'rance undergo, 
Ah let not learning too commence its foe! 
Of old, those met rewards who could excel, 
And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well: 
Though triumphs were to gen'rals only due, 
Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too. 
Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown, 
Employ their pains to spurn some others down; 
 
       And while self-love each jealous writer rules, 
Contending wits become the sport of fools: 
But still the worst with most regret commend, 
For each ill author is as bad a friend. 
To what base ends, and by what abject ways, 
Are mortals urg'd through sacred lust of praise! 
Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast, 
Nor in the critic let the man be lost! 
Good nature and good sense must ever join; 
To err is human; to forgive, divine. 
 
       But if in noble minds some dregs remain, 
Not yet purg'd off, of spleen and sour disdain, 
Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes, 
Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times. 
No pardon vile obscenity should find, 
Though wit and art conspire to move your mind; 
But dulness with obscenity must prove 
As shameful sure as impotence in love. 
In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease, 
Sprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase: 
When love was all an easy monarch's care; 
Seldom at council, never in a war: 
Jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ; 
Nay wits had pensions, and young Lords had wit: 
The fair sat panting at a courtier's play, 
And not a mask went unimprov'd away: 
The modest fan was lifted up no more, 
And virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before. 
The following licence of a foreign reign 
Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain; 
Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation, 
And taught more pleasant methods of salvation; 
Where Heav'n's free subjects might their rights dispute, 
Lest God himself should seem too absolute: 
Pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare, 
And Vice admired to find a flatt'rer there! 
Encourag'd thus, wit's Titans brav'd the skies, 
And the press groan'd with licenc'd blasphemies. 
These monsters, critics! with your darts engage, 
Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage! 
Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice, 
Will needs mistake an author into vice; 
All seems infected that th' infected spy, 
As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Reading & Books', 'Social Commentaries', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44897/an-essay-on-criticism-part-2,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,An Essay on Criticism: Part 3,"Learn then what morals critics ought to show,
For 'tis but half a judge's task, to know.
'Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning, join;
In all you speak, let truth and candour shine:
That not alone what to your sense is due,
All may allow; but seek your friendship too.

    Be silent always when you doubt your sense;
And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence:
Some positive, persisting fops we know,
Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so;
But you, with pleasure own your errors past,
And make each day a critic on the last.

    'Tis not enough, your counsel still be true;
Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do;
Men must be taught as if you taught them not;
And things unknown proposed as things forgot.
Without good breeding, truth is disapprov'd;
That only makes superior sense belov'd.

    Be niggards of advice on no pretence;
For the worst avarice is that of sense.
With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust,
Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.
Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;
Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.

    'Twere well might critics still this freedom take,
But Appius reddens at each word you speak,
And stares,  Tremendous ! with a threatening eye,
Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry!
Fear most to tax an honourable fool,
Whose right it is, uncensur'd, to be dull;
Such, without wit, are poets when they please,
As without learning they can take degrees.
Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires,
And flattery to fulsome dedicators,
Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,
Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.
'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain,
And charitably let the dull be vain:
Your silence there is better than your spite,
For who can rail so long as they can write?
Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,
And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.
False steps but help them to renew the race,
As after stumbling, jades will mend their pace.
What crowds of these, impenitently bold,
In sounds and jingling syllables grown old,
Still run on poets, in a raging vein,
Even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain,
Strain out the last, dull droppings of their sense,
And rhyme with all the rage of impotence!

    Such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis true,
There are as mad, abandon'd critics too.
The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,
With loads of learned lumber in his head,
With his own tongue still edifies his ears,
And always list'ning to himself appears.
All books he reads, and all he reads assails,
From Dryden's Fables down to Durfey's Tales.
With him, most authors steal their works, or buy;
Garth did not write his own  Dispensary .
Name a new play, and he's the poet's friend,
Nay show'd his faults—but when would poets mend?
No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd,
Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard:
Nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you dead:
For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks;
It still looks home, and short excursions makes;
But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks;
And never shock'd, and never turn'd aside,
Bursts out, resistless, with a thund'ring tide.

    But where's the man, who counsel can bestow,
Still pleas'd to teach, and yet not proud to know?
Unbias'd, or by favour or by spite;
Not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly right;
Though learn'd, well-bred; and though well-bred, sincere;
Modestly bold, and humanly severe?
Who to a friend his faults can freely show,
And gladly praise the merit of a foe?
Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfin'd;
A knowledge both of books and human kind;
Gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from pride;
And love to praise, with reason on his side?

    Such once were critics; such the happy few,
Athens and Rome in better ages knew.
The mighty Stagirite first left the shore,
Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore:
He steer'd securely, and discover'd far,
Led by the light of the Mæonian Star.
Poets, a race long unconfin'd and free,
Still fond and proud of savage liberty,
Receiv'd his laws; and stood convinc'd 'twas fit,
Who conquer'd nature, should preside o'er wit.

    Horace still charms with graceful negligence,
And without methods talks us into sense,
Will, like a friend, familiarly convey
The truest notions in the easiest way.
He, who supreme in judgment, as in wit,
Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ,
Yet judg'd with coolness, though he sung with fire;
His precepts teach but what his works inspire.
Our critics take a contrary extreme,
They judge with fury, but they write with fle'me:
Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations
By wits, than critics in as wrong quotations.

    See Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine,
And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line!
    Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,
The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.

    In grave Quintilian's copious work we find
The justest rules, and clearest method join'd;
Thus useful arms in magazines we place,
All rang'd in order, and dispos'd with grace,
But less to please the eye, than arm the hand,
Still fit for use, and ready at command.

    Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,
And bless their critic with a poet's fire.
An ardent judge, who zealous in his trust,
With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;
Whose own example strengthens all his laws;
And is himself that great sublime he draws.

    Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd,
Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd;
Learning and Rome alike in empire grew,
And arts still follow'd where her eagles flew;
From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom,
And the same age saw learning fall, and Rome.
With tyranny, then superstition join'd,
As that the body, this enslav'd the mind;
Much was believ'd, but little understood,
And to be dull was constru'd to be good;
A second deluge learning thus o'er-run,
And the monks finish'd what the Goths begun.

    At length Erasmus, that great, injur'd name,
(The glory of the priesthood, and the shame!)
Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age,
And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.

    But see! each Muse, in Leo's golden days,
Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays!
Rome's ancient genius, o'er its ruins spread,
Shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend head!
Then sculpture and her sister-arts revive;
Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;
With sweeter notes each rising temple rung;
A Raphael painted, and a Vida sung.
Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow
The poet's bays and critic's ivy grow:
Cremona now shall ever boast thy name,
As next in place to Mantua, next in fame!

    But soon by impious arms from Latium chas'd,
Their ancient bounds the banished Muses pass'd;
Thence arts o'er all the northern world advance;
But critic-learning flourish'd most in France.
The rules a nation born to serve, obeys,
And Boileau still in right of Horace sways.
But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despis'd,
And kept unconquer'd, and uncivilis'd,
Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,
We still defied the Romans, as of old.
Yet some there were, among the sounder few
Of those who less presum'd, and better knew,
Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,
And here restor'd wit's fundamental laws.
Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell
""Nature's chief master-piece is writing well.""
Such was Roscommon—not more learn'd than good,
With manners gen'rous as his noble blood;
To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,
And ev'ry author's merit, but his own.
Such late was Walsh—the Muse's judge and friend,
Who justly knew to blame or to commend;
To failings mild, but zealous for desert;
The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.
This humble praise, lamented shade! receive,
This praise at least a grateful Muse may give:
The Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,
Prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tender wing,
(Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise,
But in low numbers short excursions tries:
Content, if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view,
The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:
Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame,
Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame,
Averse alike to flatter, or offend,
Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Reading & Books', 'Social Commentaries', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44898/an-essay-on-criticism-part-3,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,The Rape of the Lock: Canto 1,"Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos; 
Sedjuvat, hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis. 
(Martial, Epigrams 12.84) 


What dire offence from am'rous causes springs, 
What mighty contests rise from trivial things, 
I sing—This verse to Caryl, Muse! is due: 
This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view: 
Slight is the subject, but not so the praise, 
If she inspire, and he approve my lays. 
 
       Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel 
A well-bred lord t' assault a gentle belle? 
O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd, 
Could make a gentle belle reject a lord? 
In tasks so bold, can little men engage, 
And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage? 
 
       Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray, 
And op'd those eyes that must eclipse the day; 
Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake, 
And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake: 
Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground, 
And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound. 
Belinda still her downy pillow press'd, 
Her guardian sylph prolong'd the balmy rest: 
'Twas he had summon'd to her silent bed 
The morning dream that hover'd o'er her head; 
A youth more glitt'ring than a birthnight beau, 
(That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow) 
Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay, 
And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say. 
 
       ""Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care 
Of thousand bright inhabitants of air! 
If e'er one vision touch'd thy infant thought, 
Of all the nurse and all the priest have taught, 
Of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen, 
The silver token, and the circled green, 
Or virgins visited by angel pow'rs, 
With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs, 
Hear and believe! thy own importance know, 
Nor bound thy narrow views to things below. 
Some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd, 
To maids alone and children are reveal'd: 
What tho' no credit doubting wits may give? 
The fair and innocent shall still believe. 
Know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly, 
The light militia of the lower sky; 
These, though unseen, are ever on the wing, 
Hang o'er the box, and hover round the Ring. 
Think what an equipage thou hast in air, 
And view with scorn two pages and a chair. 
As now your own, our beings were of old, 
And once inclos'd in woman's beauteous mould; 
Thence, by a soft transition, we repair 
From earthly vehicles to these of air. 
Think not, when woman's transient breath is fled, 
That all her vanities at once are dead; 
Succeeding vanities she still regards, 
And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards. 
Her joy in gilded chariots, when alive, 
And love of ombre, after death survive. 
For when the fair in all their pride expire, 
To their first elements their souls retire: 
The sprites of fiery termagants in flame 
Mount up, and take a Salamander's name. 
Soft yielding minds to water glide away, 
And sip with Nymphs, their elemental tea. 
The graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome, 
In search of mischief still on earth to roam. 
The light coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair, 
And sport and flutter in the fields of air. 
 
       Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste 
Rejects mankind, is by some sylph embrac'd: 
For spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease 
Assume what sexes and what shapes they please. 
What guards the purity of melting maids, 
In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades, 
Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark, 
The glance by day, the whisper in the dark, 
When kind occasion prompts their warm desires, 
When music softens, and when dancing fires? 
'Tis but their sylph, the wise celestials know, 
Though honour is the word with men below. 
 
       Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face, 
For life predestin'd to the gnomes' embrace. 
These swell their prospects and exalt their pride, 
When offers are disdain'd, and love denied: 
Then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain, 
While peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train, 
And garters, stars, and coronets appear, 
And in soft sounds 'Your Grace' salutes their ear. 
'Tis these that early taint the female soul, 
Instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll, 
Teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know, 
And little hearts to flutter at a beau. 
 
       Oft, when the world imagine women stray, 
The Sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way, 
Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue, 
And old impertinence expel by new. 
What tender maid but must a victim fall 
To one man's treat, but for another's ball? 
When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand, 
If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand? 
With varying vanities, from ev'ry part, 
They shift the moving toyshop of their heart; 
Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive, 
Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive. 
This erring mortals levity may call, 
Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all. 
 
       Of these am I, who thy protection claim, 
A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name. 
Late, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air, 
In the clear mirror of thy ruling star 
I saw, alas! some dread event impend, 
Ere to the main this morning sun descend, 
But Heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where: 
Warn'd by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware! 
This to disclose is all thy guardian can. 
Beware of all, but most beware of man!"" 
 
       He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long, 
Leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue. 
'Twas then, Belinda, if report say true, 
Thy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux; 
Wounds, charms, and ardors were no sooner read, 
But all the vision vanish'd from thy head. 
 
       And now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd, 
Each silver vase in mystic order laid. 
First, rob'd in white, the nymph intent adores 
With head uncover'd, the cosmetic pow'rs. 
A heav'nly image in the glass appears, 
To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears; 
Th' inferior priestess, at her altar's side, 
Trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride. 
Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here 
The various off'rings of the world appear; 
From each she nicely culls with curious toil, 
And decks the goddess with the glitt'ring spoil. 
This casket India's glowing gems unlocks, 
And all Arabia breathes from yonder box. 
The tortoise here and elephant unite, 
Transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white. 
Here files of pins extend their shining rows, 
Puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux. 
Now awful beauty puts on all its arms; 
The fair each moment rises in her charms, 
Repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace, 
And calls forth all the wonders of her face; 
Sees by degrees a purer blush arise, 
And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes. 
The busy Sylphs surround their darling care; 
These set the head, and those divide the hair, 
Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown; 
And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44906/the-rape-of-the-lock-canto-1,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,The Rape of the Lock: Canto 2,"Not with more glories, in th' etherial plain, 
The sun first rises o'er the purpled main, 
Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams 
Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames. 
Fair nymphs, and well-dress'd youths around her shone, 
But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone. 
On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore, 
Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore. 
Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose, 
Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those: 
Favours to none, to all she smiles extends; 
Oft she rejects, but never once offends. 
Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike, 
And, like the sun, they shine on all alike. 
Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride, 
Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide: 
If to her share some female errors fall, 
Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all. 
 
       This nymph, to the destruction of mankind, 
Nourish'd two locks, which graceful hung behind 
In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck 
With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck. 
Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains, 
And mighty hearts are held in slender chains. 
With hairy springes we the birds betray, 
Slight lines of hair surprise the finney prey, 
Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare, 
And beauty draws us with a single hair. 
 
       Th' advent'rous baron the bright locks admir'd; 
He saw, he wish'd, and to the prize aspir'd. 
Resolv'd to win, he meditates the way, 
By force to ravish, or by fraud betray; 
For when success a lover's toil attends, 
Few ask, if fraud or force attain'd his ends. 
 
       For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implor'd 
Propitious Heav'n, and ev'ry pow'r ador'd, 
But chiefly love—to love an altar built, 
Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt. 
There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves; 
And all the trophies of his former loves; 
With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre, 
And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire. 
Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes 
Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize: 
The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r, 
The rest, the winds dispers'd in empty air. 
 
       But now secure the painted vessel glides, 
The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides, 
While melting music steals upon the sky, 
And soften'd sounds along the waters die. 
Smooth flow the waves, the zephyrs gently play, 
Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay. 
All but the Sylph—with careful thoughts opprest, 
Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast. 
He summons strait his denizens of air; 
The lucid squadrons round the sails repair: 
Soft o'er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe, 
That seem'd but zephyrs to the train beneath. 
Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold, 
Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold. 
Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight, 
Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light, 
Loose to the wind their airy garments flew, 
Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew; 
Dipp'd in the richest tincture of the skies, 
Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes, 
While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings, 
Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings. 
Amid the circle, on the gilded mast, 
Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd; 
His purple pinions op'ning to the sun, 
He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun. 
 
       ""Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear! 
Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and Dæmons, hear! 
Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd 
By laws eternal to th' aerial kind. 
Some in the fields of purest æther play, 
And bask and whiten in the blaze of day. 
Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high, 
Or roll the planets through the boundless sky. 
Some less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light 
Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night, 
Or suck the mists in grosser air below, 
Or dip their pinions in the painted bow, 
Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main, 
Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain. 
Others on earth o'er human race preside, 
Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide: 
Of these the chief the care of nations own, 
And guard with arms divine the British throne. 
 
       ""Our humbler province is to tend the fair, 
Not a less pleasing, though less glorious care. 
To save the powder from too rude a gale, 
Nor let th' imprison'd essences exhale, 
To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs, 
To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs 
A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs, 
Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs; 
Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow, 
To change a flounce, or add a furbelow. 
 
       ""This day, black omens threat the brightest fair 
That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care; 
Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight, 
But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night. 
Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law, 
Or some frail china jar receive a flaw; 
Or stain her honour, or her new brocade, 
Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade; 
Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball; 
Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall. 
Haste, then, ye spirits! to your charge repair: 
The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care; 
The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign; 
And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine; 
Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite lock; 
Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock. 
 
       ""To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note, 
We trust th' important charge, the petticoat: 
Oft have we known that sev'n-fold fence to fail, 
Though stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale. 
Form a strong line about the silver bound, 
And guard the wide circumference around. 
 
       ""Whatever spirit, careless of his charge, 
His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large, 
Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins, 
Be stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins; 
Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie, 
Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye: 
Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain, 
While clogg'd he beats his silken wings in vain; 
Or alum styptics with contracting pow'r 
Shrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flow'r. 
Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel 
The giddy motion of the whirling mill, 
In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow, 
And tremble at the sea that froths below!"" 
 
       He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend; 
Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend, 
Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair, 
Some hang upon the pendants of her ear; 
With beating hearts the dire event they wait, 
Anxious, and trembling for the birth of fate.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44907/the-rape-of-the-lock-canto-2,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,The Rape of the Lock: Canto 3,"Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flow'rs, 
Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs, 
There stands a structure of majestic frame, 
Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name. 
Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom 
Of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home; 
Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey, 
Dost sometimes counsel take—and sometimes tea. 
 
       Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort, 
To taste awhile the pleasures of a court; 
In various talk th' instructive hours they pass'd, 
Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last; 
One speaks the glory of the British queen, 
And one describes a charming Indian screen; 
A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes; 
At ev'ry word a reputation dies. 
Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat, 
With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that. 
 
       Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day, 
The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray; 
The hungry judges soon the sentence sign, 
And wretches hang that jury-men may dine; 
The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace, 
And the long labours of the toilet cease. 
Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites, 
Burns to encounter two adventrous knights, 
At ombre singly to decide their doom; 
And swells her breast with conquests yet to come. 
Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join, 
Each band the number of the sacred nine. 
Soon as she spreads her hand, th' aerial guard 
Descend, and sit on each important card: 
First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore, 
Then each, according to the rank they bore; 
For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race, 
Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place. 
 
       Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd, 
With hoary whiskers and a forky beard; 
And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r, 
Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r; 
Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band, 
Caps on their heads, and halberds in their hand; 
And parti-colour'd troops, a shining train, 
Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain. 
 
       The skilful nymph reviews her force with care: 
""Let Spades be trumps!"" she said, and trumps they were. 
 
       Now move to war her sable Matadores, 
In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors. 
Spadillio first, unconquerable lord! 
Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board. 
As many more Manillio forc'd to yield, 
And march'd a victor from the verdant field. 
Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard 
Gain'd but one trump and one plebeian card. 
With his broad sabre next, a chief in years, 
The hoary Majesty of Spades appears; 
Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd; 
The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd. 
The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage, 
Proves the just victim of his royal rage. 
Ev'n mighty Pam, that kings and queens o'erthrew 
And mow'd down armies in the fights of loo, 
Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid, 
Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade! 
 
       Thus far both armies to Belinda yield; 
Now to the baron fate inclines the field. 
His warlike Amazon her host invades, 
Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades. 
The Club's black tyrant first her victim died, 
Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride: 
What boots the regal circle on his head, 
His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread; 
That long behind he trails his pompous robe, 
And of all monarchs, only grasps the globe? 
 
       The baron now his diamonds pours apace; 
Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face, 
And his refulgent Queen, with pow'rs combin'd 
Of broken troops an easy conquest find. 
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen, 
With throngs promiscuous strow the level green. 
Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs, 
Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons, 
With like confusion diff'rent nations fly, 
Of various habit, and of various dye, 
The pierc'd battalions disunited fall. 
In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all. 
 
       The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts, 
And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts. 
At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook, 
A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look; 
She sees, and trembles at th' approaching ill, 
Just in the jaws of ruin, and codille. 
And now (as oft in some distemper'd state) 
On one nice trick depends the gen'ral fate. 
An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen 
Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen: 
He springs to vengeance with an eager pace, 
And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace. 
The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky; 
The walls, the woods, and long canals reply. 
 
       Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate, 
Too soon dejected, and too soon elate! 
Sudden, these honours shall be snatch'd away, 
And curs'd for ever this victorious day. 
 
       For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd, 
The berries crackle, and the mill turns round. 
On shining altars of Japan they raise 
The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze. 
From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide, 
While China's earth receives the smoking tide. 
At once they gratify their scent and taste, 
And frequent cups prolong the rich repast. 
Straight hover round the fair her airy band; 
Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd, 
Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd, 
Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade. 
Coffee, (which makes the politician wise, 
And see through all things with his half-shut eyes) 
Sent up in vapours to the baron's brain 
New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain. 
Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere 'tis too late, 
Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate! 
Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air, 
She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair! 
 
       But when to mischief mortals bend their will, 
How soon they find fit instruments of ill! 
Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace 
A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case; 
So ladies in romance assist their knight 
Present the spear, and arm him for the fight. 
He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends 
The little engine on his fingers' ends; 
This just behind Belinda's neck he spread, 
As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head. 
Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair, 
A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair, 
And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear, 
Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near. 
Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought 
The close recesses of the virgin's thought; 
As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd, 
He watch'd th' ideas rising in her mind, 
Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art, 
An earthly lover lurking at her heart. 
Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd, 
Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd. 
 
       The peer now spreads the glitt'ring forfex wide, 
T' inclose the lock; now joins it, to divide. 
Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd, 
A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd; 
Fate urg'd the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain, 
(But airy substance soon unites again). 
The meeting points the sacred hair dissever 
From the fair head, for ever, and for ever! 
 
       Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes, 
And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies. 
Not louder shrieks to pitying Heav'n are cast, 
When husbands or when lap-dogs breathe their last, 
Or when rich China vessels, fall'n from high, 
In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie! 
 
       ""Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,"" 
The victor cried, ""the glorious prize is mine! 
While fish in streams, or birds delight in air, 
Or in a coach and six the British fair, 
As long at  Atalantis shall be read, 
Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed, 
While visits shall be paid on solemn days, 
When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze, 
While nymphs take treats, or assignations give, 
So long my honour, name, and praise shall live! 
What time would spare, from steel receives its date, 
And monuments, like men, submit to fate! 
Steel could the labour of the gods destroy, 
And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy; 
Steel could the works of mortal pride confound, 
And hew triumphal arches to the ground. 
What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel 
The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel?""",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44908/the-rape-of-the-lock-canto-3,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss, 
Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss, 
Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die, 
Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry, 
E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair, 
As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravish'd hair. 
 
       For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew, 
And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew, 
Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite, 
As ever sullied the fair face of light, 
Down to the central earth, his proper scene, 
Repair'd to search the gloomy cave of Spleen. 
 
       Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome, 
And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome. 
No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows, 
The dreaded East is all the wind that blows. 
Here, in a grotto, shelter'd close from air, 
And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare, 
She sighs for ever on her pensive bed, 
Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head. 
 
       Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place, 
But diff'ring far in figure and in face. 
Here stood Ill Nature like an ancient maid, 
Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd; 
With store of pray'rs, for mornings, nights, and noons, 
Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons. 
 
       There Affectation, with a sickly mien, 
Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen, 
Practis'd to lisp, and hang the head aside, 
Faints into airs, and languishes with pride, 
On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe, 
Wrapp'd in a gown, for sickness, and for show. 
The fair ones feel such maladies as these, 
When each new night-dress gives a new disease. 
 
       A constant vapour o'er the palace flies; 
Strange phantoms, rising as the mists arise; 
Dreadful, as hermit's dreams in haunted shades, 
Or bright, as visions of expiring maids. 
Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires, 
Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires: 
Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes, 
And crystal domes, and angels in machines. 
 
       Unnumber'd throngs on ev'ry side are seen 
Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen. 
Here living teapots stand, one arm held out, 
One bent; the handle this, and that the spout: 
A pipkin there, like Homer's tripod walks; 
Here sighs a jar, and there a goose pie talks; 
Men prove with child, as pow'rful fancy works, 
And maids turn'd bottles, call aloud for corks. 
 
       Safe pass'd the Gnome through this fantastic band, 
A branch of healing spleenwort in his hand. 
Then thus address'd the pow'r: ""Hail, wayward Queen! 
Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen: 
Parent of vapours and of female wit, 
Who give th' hysteric, or poetic fit, 
On various tempers act by various ways, 
Make some take physic, others scribble plays; 
Who cause the proud their visits to delay, 
And send the godly in a pet to pray. 
A nymph there is, that all thy pow'r disdains, 
And thousands more in equal mirth maintains. 
But oh! if e'er thy gnome could spoil a grace, 
Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face, 
Like citron waters matrons' cheeks inflame, 
Or change complexions at a losing game; 
If e'er with airy horns I planted heads, 
Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds, 
Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude, 
Or discompos'd the head-dress of a prude, 
Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease, 
Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease: 
Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin; 
That single act gives half the world the spleen."" 
 
       The goddess with a discontented air 
Seems to reject him, though she grants his pray'r. 
A wondrous bag with both her hands she binds, 
Like that where once Ulysses held the winds; 
There she collects the force of female lungs, 
Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues. 
A vial next she fills with fainting fears, 
Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears. 
The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away, 
Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day. 
 
       Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found, 
Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound. 
Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent, 
And all the Furies issu'd at the vent. 
Belinda burns with more than mortal ire, 
And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire. 
""Oh wretched maid!"" she spread her hands, and cried, 
(While Hampton's echoes, ""Wretched maid!"" replied) 
""Was it for this you took such constant care 
The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare? 
For this your locks in paper durance bound, 
For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around? 
For this with fillets strain'd your tender head, 
And bravely bore the double loads of lead? 
Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair, 
While the fops envy, and the ladies stare! 
Honour forbid! at whose unrivall'd shrine 
Ease, pleasure, virtue, all, our sex resign. 
Methinks already I your tears survey, 
Already hear the horrid things they say, 
Already see you a degraded toast, 
And all your honour in a whisper lost! 
How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend? 
'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend! 
And shall this prize, th' inestimable prize, 
Expos'd through crystal to the gazing eyes, 
And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays, 
On that rapacious hand for ever blaze? 
Sooner shall grass in Hyde Park Circus grow, 
And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow; 
Sooner let earth, air, sea, to chaos fall, 
Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!"" 
 
       She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs, 
And bids her beau demand the precious hairs: 
(Sir Plume, of amber snuff-box justly vain, 
And the nice conduct of a clouded cane) 
With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face, 
He first the snuffbox open'd, then the case, 
And thus broke out—""My Lord, why, what the devil? 
Z——ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil! 
Plague on't! 'tis past a jest—nay prithee, pox! 
Give her the hair""—he spoke, and rapp'd his box. 
 
       ""It grieves me much,"" replied the peer again 
""Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain. 
But by this lock, this sacred lock I swear, 
(Which never more shall join its parted hair; 
Which never more its honours shall renew, 
Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew) 
That while my nostrils draw the vital air, 
This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear."" 
He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread 
The long-contended honours of her head. 
 
       But Umbriel, hateful gnome! forbears not so; 
He breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow. 
Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears, 
Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears; 
On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head, 
Which, with a sigh, she rais'd; and thus she said: 
 
       ""For ever curs'd be this detested day, 
Which snatch'd my best, my fav'rite curl away! 
Happy! ah ten times happy, had I been, 
If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen! 
Yet am not I the first mistaken maid, 
By love of courts to num'rous ills betray'd. 
Oh had I rather unadmir'd remain'd 
In some lone isle, or distant northern land; 
Where the gilt chariot never marks the way, 
Where none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea! 
There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye, 
Like roses, that in deserts bloom and die. 
What mov'd my mind with youthful lords to roam? 
Oh had I stay'd, and said my pray'rs at home! 
'Twas this, the morning omens seem'd to tell, 
Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell; 
The tott'ring china shook without a wind, 
Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind! 
A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate, 
In mystic visions, now believ'd too late! 
See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs! 
My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares: 
These, in two sable ringlets taught to break, 
Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck. 
The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone, 
And in its fellow's fate foresees its own; 
Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal shears demands, 
And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands. 
Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize 
Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!""",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44909/the-rape-of-the-lock-canto-4,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,The Rape of the Lock: Canto 5,"She said: the pitying audience melt in tears, 
But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears. 
In vain Thalestris with reproach assails, 
For who can move when fair Belinda fails? 
Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain, 
While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain. 
Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan; 
Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph began. 
 
       ""Say, why are beauties prais'd and honour'd most, 
The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast? 
Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford, 
Why angels call'd, and angel-like ador'd? 
Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov'd beaux, 
Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows? 
How vain are all these glories, all our pains, 
Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains: 
That men may say, when we the front-box grace: 
'Behold the first in virtue, as in face!' 
Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day, 
Charm'd the smallpox, or chas'd old age away; 
Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce, 
Or who would learn one earthly thing of use? 
To patch, nay ogle, might become a saint, 
Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint. 
But since, alas! frail beauty must decay, 
Curl'd or uncurl'd, since locks will turn to grey, 
Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade, 
And she who scorns a man, must die a maid; 
What then remains but well our pow'r to use, 
And keep good humour still whate'er we lose? 
And trust me, dear! good humour can prevail, 
When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail. 
Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll; 
Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul."" 
 
       So spoke the dame, but no applause ensu'd; 
Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her prude. 
""To arms, to arms!"" the fierce virago cries, 
And swift as lightning to the combat flies. 
All side in parties, and begin th' attack; 
Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack; 
Heroes' and heroines' shouts confus'dly rise, 
And bass, and treble voices strike the skies. 
No common weapons in their hands are found, 
Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound. 
 
       So when bold Homer makes the gods engage, 
And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage; 
'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms; 
And all Olympus rings with loud alarms. 
Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around; 
Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound; 
Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way; 
And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day! 
 
       Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height 
Clapp'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight: 
Propp'd on their bodkin spears, the sprites survey 
The growing combat, or assist the fray. 
 
       While through the press enrag'd Thalestris flies, 
And scatters death around from both her eyes, 
A beau and witling perish'd in the throng, 
One died in metaphor, and one in song. 
""O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,"" 
Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair. 
A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast, 
""Those eyes are made so killing""—was his last. 
Thus on Mæeander's flow'ry margin lies 
Th' expiring swan, and as he sings he dies. 
 
       When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down, 
Chloe stepp'd in, and kill'd him with a frown; 
She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain, 
But at her smile, the beau reviv'd again. 
 
       Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air, 
Weighs the men's wits against the lady's hair; 
The doubtful beam long nods from side to side; 
At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside. 
 
       See, fierce Belinda on the baron flies, 
With more than usual lightning in her eyes, 
Nor fear'd the chief th' unequal fight to try, 
Who sought no more than on his foe to die. 
But this bold lord with manly strength endu'd, 
She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd: 
Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew, 
A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw; 
The Gnomes direct, to ev'ry atom just, 
The pungent grains of titillating dust. 
Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows, 
And the high dome re-echoes to his nose. 
 
       ""Now meet thy fate"", incens'd Belinda cried, 
And drew a deadly bodkin from her side. 
(The same, his ancient personage to deck, 
Her great great grandsire wore about his neck 
In three seal-rings; which after, melted down, 
Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown: 
Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew, 
The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew; 
Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs, 
Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.) 
 
       ""Boast not my fall,"" he cried, ""insulting foe! 
Thou by some other shalt be laid as low. 
Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind; 
All that I dread is leaving you benind! 
Rather than so, ah let me still survive, 
And burn in Cupid's flames—but burn alive."" 
 
       ""Restore the lock!"" she cries; and all around 
""Restore the lock!"" the vaulted roofs rebound. 
Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain 
Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain. 
But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd, 
The chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost! 
The lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain, 
In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain: 
With such a prize no mortal must be blest, 
So Heav'n decrees! with Heav'n who can contest? 
 
       Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere, 
Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there. 
There hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases, 
And beaux' in snuff boxes and tweezercases. 
There broken vows and deathbed alms are found, 
And lovers' hearts with ends of riband bound; 
The courtier's promises, and sick man's prayers, 
The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs, 
Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea, 
Dried butterflies, and tomes of casuistry. 
 
       But trust the Muse—she saw it upward rise, 
Though mark'd by none but quick, poetic eyes: 
(So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew, 
To Proculus alone confess'd in view) 
A sudden star, it shot through liquid air, 
And drew behind a radiant trail of hair. 
Not Berenice's locks first rose so bright, 
The heav'ns bespangling with dishevell'd light. 
The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies, 
And pleas'd pursue its progress through the skies. 
 
       This the beau monde shall from the Mall survey, 
And hail with music its propitious ray. 
This the blest lover shall for Venus take, 
And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake. 
This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies, 
When next he looks through Galileo's eyes; 
And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom 
The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome. 
 
       Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd hair, 
Which adds new glory to the shining sphere! 
Not all the tresses that fair head can boast 
Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost. 
For, after all the murders of your eye, 
When, after millions slain, yourself shall die: 
When those fair suns shall set, as set they must, 
And all those tresses shall be laid in dust, 
This lock, the Muse shall consecrate to fame 
And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44910/the-rape-of-the-lock-canto-5,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady,"What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?
'Tis she!—but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well?
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?

     Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
The glorious fault of angels and of gods;
Thence to their images on earth it flows,
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage:
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;
Like eastern kings a lazy state they keep,
And close confin'd to their own palace, sleep.

     From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die)
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.
As into air the purer spirits flow,
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below;
So flew the soul to its congenial place,
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.

     But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death:
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.
Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball,
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall;
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way)
""Lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd,
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield.
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.""

     What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!)
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier.
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public show?
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?
What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow;
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made.

     So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!

     Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays;
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart,
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44891/elegy-to-the-memory-of-an-unfortunate-lady,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Eloisa to Abelard,"In these deep solitudes and awful cells,
Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,
And ever-musing melancholy reigns;
What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?
Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?
Yet, yet I love!—From Abelard it came,
And Eloisa yet must kiss the name.

     Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,
Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd.
Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise,
Where mix'd with God's, his lov'd idea lies:
O write it not, my hand—the name appears
Already written—wash it out, my tears!
In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,
Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.

     Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains
Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:
Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;
Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn!
Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins keep,
And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!
Though cold like you, unmov'd, and silent grown,
I have not yet forgot myself to stone.
All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part,
Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;
Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,
Nor tears, for ages, taught to flow in vain.

     Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,
That well-known name awakens all my woes.
Oh name for ever sad! for ever dear!
Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.
I tremble too, where'er my own I find,
Some dire misfortune follows close behind.
Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,
Led through a sad variety of woe:
Now warm in love, now with'ring in thy bloom,
Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!
There stern religion quench'd th' unwilling flame,
There died the best of passions, love and fame.

     Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join
Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.
Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away;
And is my Abelard less kind than they?
Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,
Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r;
No happier task these faded eyes pursue;
To read and weep is all they now can do.

     Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;
Ah, more than share it! give me all thy grief.
Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid,
Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;
They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,
Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,
The virgin's wish without her fears impart,
Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,
Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,
And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.

     Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,
When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;
My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,
Some emanation of th' all-beauteous Mind.
Those smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry day,
Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.
Guiltless I gaz'd; heav'n listen'd while you sung;
And truths divine came mended from that tongue.
From lips like those what precept fail'd to move?
Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love.
Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,
Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man.
Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;
Nor envy them, that heav'n I lose for thee.

     How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,
Curse on all laws but those which love has made!
Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,
Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies,
Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,
August her deed, and sacred be her fame;
Before true passion all those views remove,
Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?
The jealous God, when we profane his fires,
Those restless passions in revenge inspires;
And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,
Who seek in love for aught but love alone.
Should at my feet the world's great master fall,
Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em all:
Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove;
No, make me mistress to the man I love;
If there be yet another name more free,
More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!
Oh happy state! when souls each other draw,
When love is liberty, and nature, law:
All then is full, possessing, and possess'd,
No craving void left aching in the breast:
Ev'n thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,
And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.
This sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)
And once the lot of Abelard and me.

     Alas, how chang'd! what sudden horrors rise!
A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!
Where, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,
Her poniard, had oppos'd the dire command.
Barbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;
The crime was common, common be the pain.
I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,
Let tears, and burning blushes speak the rest.

    Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,
When victims at yon altar's foot we lay?
Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,
When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?
As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,
The shrines all trembl'd, and the lamps grew pale:
Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd,
And saints with wonder heard the vows I made.
Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,
Not on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:
Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,
And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.
Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;
Those still at least are left thee to bestow.
Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie,
Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,
Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;
Give all thou canst—and let me dream the rest.
Ah no! instruct me other joys to prize,
With other beauties charm my partial eyes,
Full in my view set all the bright abode,
And make my soul quit Abelard for God.

    Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,
Plants of thy hand, and children of thy pray'r.
From the false world in early youth they fled,
By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.
You rais'd these hallow'd walls; the desert smil'd,
And Paradise was open'd in the wild.
No weeping orphan saw his father's stores
Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;
No silver saints, by dying misers giv'n,
Here brib'd the rage of ill-requited heav'n:
But such plain roofs as piety could raise,
And only vocal with the Maker's praise.
In these lone walls (their days eternal bound)
These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,
Where awful arches make a noonday night,
And the dim windows shed a solemn light;
Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray,
And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.
But now no face divine contentment wears,
'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.
See how the force of others' pray'rs I try,
(O pious fraud of am'rous charity!)
But why should I on others' pray'rs depend?
Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!
Ah let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,
And all those tender names in one, thy love!
The darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd
Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,
The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills,
The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,
The dying gales that pant upon the trees,
The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;
No more these scenes my meditation aid,
Or lull to rest the visionary maid.
But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,
Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,
Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws
A death-like silence, and a dread repose:
Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,
Shades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry green,
Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,
And breathes a browner horror on the woods.

    Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;
Sad proof how well a lover can obey!
Death, only death, can break the lasting chain;
And here, ev'n then, shall my cold dust remain,
Here all its frailties, all its flames resign,
And wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.

    Ah wretch! believ'd the spouse of God in vain,
Confess'd within the slave of love and man.
Assist me, Heav'n! but whence arose that pray'r?
Sprung it from piety, or from despair?
Ev'n here, where frozen chastity retires,
Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.
I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;
I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;
I view my crime, but kindle at the view,
Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;
Now turn'd to Heav'n, I weep my past offence,
Now think of thee, and curse my innocence.
Of all affliction taught a lover yet,
'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!
How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,
And love th' offender, yet detest th' offence?
How the dear object from the crime remove,
Or how distinguish penitence from love?
Unequal task! a passion to resign,
For hearts so touch'd, so pierc'd, so lost as mine.
Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,
How often must it love, how often hate!
How often hope, despair, resent, regret,
Conceal, disdain—do all things but forget.
But let Heav'n seize it, all at once 'tis fir'd;
Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspir'd!
Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,
Renounce my love, my life, myself—and you.
Fill my fond heart with God alone, for he
Alone can rival, can succeed to thee.

    How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!
The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!
Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;
Labour and rest, that equal periods keep;
""Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;""
Desires compos'd, affections ever ev'n,
Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to Heav'n.
Grace shines around her with serenest beams,
And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams.
For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms,
And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes,
For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring,
For her white virgins hymeneals sing,
To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away,
And melts in visions of eternal day.

    Far other dreams my erring soul employ,
Far other raptures, of unholy joy:
When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,
Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,
Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,
All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.
Oh curs'd, dear horrors of all-conscious night!
How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!
Provoking Daemons all restraint remove,
And stir within me every source of love.
I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,
And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.
I wake—no more I hear, no more I view,
The phantom flies me, as unkind as you.
I call aloud; it hears not what I say;
I stretch my empty arms; it glides away.
To dream once more I close my willing eyes;
Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!
Alas, no more—methinks we wand'ring go
Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,
Where round some mould'ring tower pale ivy creeps,
And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.
Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;
Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.
I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,
And wake to all the griefs I left behind.

    For thee the fates, severely kind, ordain
A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;
Thy life a long, dead calm of fix'd repose;
No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.
Still as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,
Or moving spirit bade the waters flow;
Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n,
And mild as opening gleams of promis'd heav'n.

    Come, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?
The torch of Venus burns not for the dead.
Nature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;
Ev'n thou art cold—yet Eloisa loves.
Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn
To light the dead, and warm th' unfruitful urn.

    What scenes appear where'er I turn my view?
The dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,
Rise in the grove, before the altar rise,
Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.
I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,
Thy image steals between my God and me,
Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear,
With ev'ry bead I drop too soft a tear.
When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,
And swelling organs lift the rising soul,
One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,
Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:
In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,
While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.

    While prostrate here in humble grief I lie,
Kind, virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye,
While praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,
And dawning grace is op'ning on my soul:
Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!
Oppose thyself to Heav'n; dispute my heart;
Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes
Blot out each bright idea of the skies;
Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;
Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs;
Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;
Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God!

    No, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;
Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!
Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me,
Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee.
Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;
Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.
Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view!)
Long lov'd, ador'd ideas, all adieu!
Oh Grace serene! oh virtue heav'nly fair!
Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!
Fresh blooming hope, gay daughter of the sky!
And faith, our early immortality!
Enter, each mild, each amicable guest;
Receive, and wrap me in eternal rest!

    See in her cell sad Eloisa spread,
Propp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.
In each low wind methinks a spirit calls,
And more than echoes talk along the walls.
Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,
From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.
""Come, sister, come!"" (it said, or seem'd to say)
""Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!
Once like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,
Love's victim then, though now a sainted maid:
But all is calm in this eternal sleep;
Here grief forgets to groan, and love to weep,
Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear:
For God, not man, absolves our frailties here.""

    I come, I come! prepare your roseate bow'rs,
Celestial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs.
Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go,
Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow:
Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,
And smooth my passage to the realms of day;
See my lips tremble, and my eye-balls roll,
Suck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!
Ah no—in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,
The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,
Present the cross before my lifted eye,
Teach me at once, and learn of me to die.
Ah then, thy once-lov'd Eloisa see!
It will be then no crime to gaze on me.
See from my cheek the transient roses fly!
See the last sparkle languish in my eye!
Till ev'ry motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;
And ev'n my Abelard be lov'd no more.
O Death all-eloquent! you only prove
What dust we dote on, when 'tis man we love.

    Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,
(That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy)
In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,
Bright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,
From op'ning skies may streaming glories shine,
And saints embrace thee with a love like mine.

    May one kind grave unite each hapless name,
And graft my love immortal on thy fame!
Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,
When this rebellious heart shall beat no more;
If ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings
To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,
O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,
And drink the falling tears each other sheds;
Then sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd,
""Oh may we never love as these have lov'd!""

From the full choir when loud Hosannas rise,
And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,
Amid that scene if some relenting eye
Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie,
Devotion's self shall steal a thought from Heav'n,
One human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n.
And sure, if fate some future bard shall join
In sad similitude of griefs to mine,
Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,
And image charms he must behold no more;
Such if there be, who loves so long, so well;
Let him our sad, our tender story tell;
The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;

Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Epistles to Several Persons: Epistle IV,"Est brevitate opus, ut currat sententia, neu se
Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures:
Et sermone opus est modo tristi, saepe jocoso,
Defendente vicem modo Rhetoris atque Poetae,
Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus, atque
Extenuantis eas consulto.
(Horace, Satires, I, x, 17-22)


'Tis strange, the miser should his cares employ
To gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy:
Is it less strange, the prodigal should waste
His wealth to purchase what he ne'er can taste?
Not for himself he sees, or hears, or eats;
Artists must choose his pictures, music, meats:
He buys for Topham, drawings and designs,
For Pembroke, statues, dirty gods, and coins;
Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,
And books for Mead, and butterflies for Sloane.
Think we all these are for himself? no more
Than his fine wife, alas! or finer whore.

    For what his Virro painted, built, and planted?
Only to show, how many tastes he wanted.
What brought Sir Visto's ill got wealth to waste?
Some daemon whisper'd, ""Visto! have a taste.""
Heav'n visits with a taste the wealthy fool,
And needs no rod but Ripley with a rule.
See! sportive fate, to punish awkward pride,
Bids Bubo build, and sends him such a guide:
A standing sermon, at each year's expense,
That never coxcomb reach'd magnificence!
You show us, Rome was glorious, not profuse,
And pompous buildings once were things of use.
Yet shall (my Lord) your just, your noble rules
Fill half the land with imitating fools;
Who random drawings from your sheets shall take,
And of one beauty many blunders make;
Load some vain church with old theatric state,
Turn arcs of triumph to a garden gate;
Reverse your ornaments, and hang them all
On some patch'd dog-hole ek'd with ends of wall;
Then clap four slices of pilaster on't,
That lac'd with bits of rustic, makes a front.
Or call the winds through long arcades to roar,
Proud to catch cold at a Venetian door;
Conscious they act a true Palladian part,
And, if they starve, they starve by rules of art.

    Oft have you hinted to your brother peer,
A certain truth, which many buy too dear:
Something there is more needful than expense,
And something previous ev'n to taste—'tis sense:
Good sense, which only is the gift of Heav'n,
And though no science, fairly worth the sev'n:
A light, which in yourself you must perceive;
Jones and Le Notre have it not to give.

    To build, to plant, whatever you intend,
To rear the column, or the arch to bend,
To swell the terrace, or to sink the grot;
In all, let Nature never be forgot.
But treat the goddess like a modest fair,
Nor overdress, nor leave her wholly bare;
Let not each beauty ev'rywhere be spied,
Where half the skill is decently to hide.
He gains all points, who pleasingly confounds,
Surprises, varies, and conceals the bounds.

    Consult the genius of the place in all;
That tells the waters or to rise, or fall;
Or helps th' ambitious hill the heav'ns to scale,
Or scoops in circling theatres the vale;
Calls in the country, catches opening glades,
Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades,
Now breaks, or now directs, th' intending lines;
Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.

    Still follow sense, of ev'ry art the soul,
Parts answ'ring parts shall slide into a whole,
Spontaneous beauties all around advance,
Start ev'n from difficulty, strike from chance;
Nature shall join you; time shall make it grow
A work to wonder at—perhaps a Stowe.

    Without it, proud Versailles! thy glory falls;
And Nero's terraces desert their walls:
The vast parterres a thousand hands shall make,
Lo! Cobham comes, and floats them with a lake:
Or cut wide views through mountains to the plain,
You'll wish your hill or shelter'd seat again.
Ev'n in an ornament its place remark,
Nor in an hermitage set Dr. Clarke.

    Behold Villario's ten years' toil complete;
His quincunx darkens, his espaliers meet;
The wood supports the plain, the parts unite,
And strength of shade contends with strength of light;
A waving glow his bloomy beds display,
Blushing in bright diversities of day,
With silver-quiv'ring rills meander'd o'er—
Enjoy them, you! Villario can no more;
Tir'd of the scene parterres and fountains yield,
He finds at last he better likes a field.

    Through his young woods how pleas'd Sabinus stray'd,
Or sat delighted in the thick'ning shade,
With annual joy the redd'ning shoots to greet,
Or see the stretching branches long to meet!
His son's fine taste an op'ner vista loves,
Foe to the dryads of his father's groves;
One boundless green, or flourish'd carpet views,
With all the mournful family of yews;
The thriving plants ignoble broomsticks made,
Now sweep those alleys they were born to shade.

    At Timon's villa let us pass a day,
Where all cry out, ""What sums are thrown away!""
So proud, so grand of that stupendous air,
Soft and agreeable come never there.
Greatness, with Timon, dwells in such a draught
As brings all Brobdingnag before your thought.
To compass this, his building is a town,
His pond an ocean, his parterre a down:
Who but must laugh, the master when he sees,
A puny insect, shiv'ring at a breeze!
Lo, what huge heaps of littleness around!
The whole, a labour'd quarry above ground.
Two cupids squirt before: a lake behind
Improves the keenness of the Northern wind.
His gardens next your admiration call,
On ev'ry side you look, behold the wall!
No pleasing intricacies intervene,
No artful wildness to perplex the scene;
Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother,
And half the platform just reflects the other.
The suff'ring eye inverted Nature sees,
Trees cut to statues, statues thick as trees;
With here a fountain, never to be play'd;
And there a summerhouse, that knows no shade;
Here Amphitrite sails through myrtle bow'rs;
There gladiators fight, or die in flow'rs;
Unwater'd see the drooping sea horse mourn,
And swallows roost in Nilus' dusty urn.

    My Lord advances with majestic mien,
Smit with the mighty pleasure, to be seen:
But soft—by regular approach—not yet—
First through the length of yon hot terrace sweat;
And when up ten steep slopes you've dragg'd your thighs,
Just at his study door he'll bless your eyes.

    His study! with what authors is it stor'd?
In books, not authors, curious is my Lord;
To all their dated backs he turns you round:
These Aldus printed, those Du Sueil has bound.
Lo, some are vellum, and the rest as good
For all his Lordship knows, but they are wood.
For Locke or Milton 'tis in vain to look,
These shelves admit not any modern book.

    And now the chapel's silver bell you hear,
That summons you to all the pride of pray'r:
Light quirks of music, broken and uneven,
Make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven.
On painted ceilings you devoutly stare,
Where sprawl the saints of Verrio or Laguerre,
On gilded clouds in fair expansion lie,
And bring all paradise before your eye.
To rest, the cushion and soft dean invite,
Who never mentions Hell to ears polite.

    But hark! the chiming clocks to dinner call;
A hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall:
The rich buffet well-colour'd serpents grace,
And gaping Tritons spew to wash your face.
Is this a dinner? this a genial room?
No, 'tis a temple, and a hecatomb.
A solemn sacrifice, perform'd in state,
You drink by measure, and to minutes eat.
So quick retires each flying course, you'd swear
Sancho's dread doctor and his wand were there.
Between each act the trembling salvers ring,
From soup to sweet wine, and God bless the King.
In plenty starving, tantaliz'd in state,
And complaisantly help'd to all I hate,
Treated, caress'd, and tir'd, I take my leave,
Sick of his civil pride from morn to eve;
I curse such lavish cost, and little skill,
And swear no day was ever pass'd so ill.

    Yet hence the poor are cloth'd, the hungry fed;
Health to himself, and to his infants bread
The lab'rer bears: What his hard heart denies,
His charitable vanity supplies.

    Another age shall see the golden ear
Embrown the slope, and nod on the parterre,
Deep harvests bury all his pride has plann'd,
And laughing Ceres reassume the land.

    Who then shall grace, or who improve the soil?
Who plants like Bathurst, or who builds like Boyle.
'Tis use alone that sanctifies expense,
And splendour borrows all her rays from sense.

    His father's acres who enjoys in peace,
Or makes his neighbours glad, if he increase:
Whose cheerful tenants bless their yearly toil,
Yet to their Lord owe more than to the soil;
Whose ample lawns are not asham'd to feed
The milky heifer and deserving steed;
Whose rising forests, not for pride or show,
But future buildings, future navies, grow:
Let his plantations stretch from down to down,
First shade a country, and then raise a town.

    You too proceed! make falling arts your care,
Erect new wonders, and the old repair;
Jones and Palladio to themselves restore,
And be whate'er Vitruvius was before:
Till kings call forth th' ideas of your mind,
Proud to accomplish what such hands design'd,
Bid harbours open, public ways extend,
Bid temples, worthier of the God, ascend;
Bid the broad arch the dang'rous flood contain,
The mole projected break the roaring main;
Back to his bounds their subject sea command,
And roll obedient rivers through the land;
These honours, peace to happy Britain brings,
These are imperial works, and worthy kings.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Architecture & Design', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Money & Economics', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44894/epistles-to-several-persons-epistle-iv,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,An Essay on Man: Epistle I,"To Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke

Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things
To low ambition, and the pride of kings.
Let us (since life can little more supply
Than just to look about us and to die)
Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;
A mighty maze! but not without a plan;
A wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;
Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
Together let us beat this ample field,
Try what the open, what the covert yield;
The latent tracts, the giddy heights explore
Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
Eye Nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,
And catch the manners living as they rise;
Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;
But vindicate the ways of God to man.

I.
    Say first, of God above, or man below,
What can we reason, but from what we know?
Of man what see we, but his station here,
From which to reason, or to which refer?
Through worlds unnumber'd though the God be known,
'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.
He, who through vast immensity can pierce,
See worlds on worlds compose one universe,
Observe how system into system runs,
What other planets circle other suns,
What varied being peoples ev'ry star,
May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are.
But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,
The strong connections, nice dependencies,
Gradations just, has thy pervading soul
Look'd through? or can a part contain the whole?

    Is the great chain, that draws all to agree,
And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?

II.
    Presumptuous man! the reason wouldst thou find,
Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?
First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,
Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less!
Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made
Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade?
Or ask of yonder argent fields above,
Why Jove's satellites are less than Jove?

    Of systems possible, if 'tis confest
That Wisdom infinite must form the best,
Where all must full or not coherent be,
And all that rises, rise in due degree;
Then, in the scale of reas'ning life, 'tis plain
There must be somewhere, such a rank as man:
And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)
Is only this, if God has plac'd him wrong?

    Respecting man, whatever wrong we call,
May, must be right, as relative to all.
In human works, though labour'd on with pain,
A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;
In God's, one single can its end produce;
Yet serves to second too some other use.
So man, who here seems principal alone,
Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,
Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;
'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.

    When the proud steed shall know why man restrains
His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains:
When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod,
Is now a victim, and now Egypt's God:
Then shall man's pride and dulness comprehend
His actions', passions', being's, use and end;
Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why
This hour a slave, the next a deity.

    Then say not man's imperfect, Heav'n in fault;
Say rather, man's as perfect as he ought:
His knowledge measur'd to his state and place,
His time a moment, and a point his space.
If to be perfect in a certain sphere,
What matter, soon or late, or here or there?
The blest today is as completely so,
As who began a thousand years ago.

III.
    Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate,
All but the page prescrib'd, their present state:
From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:
Or who could suffer being here below?
The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today,
Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?
Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food,
And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.
Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n,
That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n:
Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,
A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,
Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
And now a bubble burst, and now a world.

    Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;
Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore!
What future bliss, he gives not thee to know,
But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.
Hope springs eternal in the human breast:
Man never is, but always to be blest:
The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,
Rests and expatiates in a life to come.

    Lo! the poor Indian, whose untutor'd mind
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
His soul, proud science never taught to stray
Far as the solar walk, or milky way;
Yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n,
Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heav'n;
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,
Some happier island in the wat'ry waste,
Where slaves once more their native land behold,
No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.
To be, contents his natural desire,
He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
His faithful dog shall bear him company.

IV.
    Go, wiser thou! and, in thy scale of sense
Weigh thy opinion against Providence;
Call imperfection what thou fanciest such,
Say, here he gives too little, there too much:
Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust,
Yet cry, if man's unhappy, God's unjust;
If man alone engross not Heav'n's high care,
Alone made perfect here, immortal there:
Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,
Rejudge his justice, be the God of God.
 In pride, in reas'ning pride, our error lies;
All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.
Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,
Men would be angels, angels would be gods.
Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell,
Aspiring to be angels, men rebel:
And who but wishes to invert the laws
Of order, sins against th' Eternal Cause.

V.
    Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine,
Earth for whose use? Pride answers, "" 'Tis for mine:
For me kind Nature wakes her genial pow'r,
Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'r;
Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew,
The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;
For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;
For me, health gushes from a thousand springs;
Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;
My foot-stool earth, my canopy the skies.""

    But errs not Nature from this gracious end,
From burning suns when livid deaths descend,
When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep
Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?
""No, ('tis replied) the first Almighty Cause
Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws;
Th' exceptions few; some change since all began:
And what created perfect?""—Why then man?
If the great end be human happiness,
Then Nature deviates; and can man do less?
As much that end a constant course requires
Of show'rs and sunshine, as of man's desires;
As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,
As men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise.
If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n's design,
Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline?
Who knows but he, whose hand the lightning forms,
Who heaves old ocean, and who wings the storms,
Pours fierce ambition in a Cæsar's mind,
Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?
From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs;
Account for moral, as for nat'ral things:
Why charge we Heav'n in those, in these acquit?
In both, to reason right is to submit.

    Better for us, perhaps, it might appear,
Were there all harmony, all virtue here;
That never air or ocean felt the wind;
That never passion discompos'd the mind.
But ALL subsists by elemental strife;
And passions are the elements of life.
The gen'ral order, since the whole began,
Is kept in nature, and is kept in man.

VI.
    What would this man? Now upward will he soar,
And little less than angel, would be more;
Now looking downwards, just as griev'd appears
To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.
Made for his use all creatures if he call,
Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all?
Nature to these, without profusion, kind,
The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd;
Each seeming want compensated of course,
Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;
All in exact proportion to the state;
Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.
Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:
Is Heav'n unkind to man, and man alone?
Shall he alone, whom rational we call,
Be pleas'd with nothing, if not bless'd with all?

    The bliss of man (could pride that blessing find)
Is not to act or think beyond mankind;
No pow'rs of body or of soul to share,
But what his nature and his state can bear.
Why has not man a microscopic eye?
For this plain reason, man is not a fly.
Say what the use, were finer optics giv'n,
T' inspect a mite, not comprehend the heav'n?
Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,
To smart and agonize at ev'ry pore?
Or quick effluvia darting through the brain,
Die of a rose in aromatic pain?
If nature thunder'd in his op'ning ears,
And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres,
How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still
The whisp'ring zephyr, and the purling rill?
Who finds not Providence all good and wise,
Alike in what it gives, and what denies?

VII.
    Far as creation's ample range extends,
The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends:
Mark how it mounts, to man's imperial race,
From the green myriads in the peopled grass:
What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,
The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:
Of smell, the headlong lioness between,
And hound sagacious on the tainted green:
Of hearing, from the life that fills the flood,
To that which warbles through the vernal wood:
The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!
Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:
In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true
From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew:
How instinct varies in the grov'lling swine,
Compar'd, half-reas'ning elephant, with thine:
'Twixt that, and reason, what a nice barrier;
For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near!
Remembrance and reflection how allied;
What thin partitions sense from thought divide:
And middle natures, how they long to join,
Yet never pass th' insuperable line!
Without this just gradation, could they be
Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?
The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone,
Is not thy reason all these pow'rs in one?

VIII.
    See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth,
All matter quick, and bursting into birth.
Above, how high, progressive life may go!
Around, how wide! how deep extend below!
Vast chain of being, which from God began,
Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,
Beast, bird, fish, insect! what no eye can see,
No glass can reach! from infinite to thee,
From thee to nothing!—On superior pow'rs
Were we to press, inferior might on ours:
Or in the full creation leave a void,
Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd:
From nature's chain whatever link you strike,
Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.

    And, if each system in gradation roll
Alike essential to th' amazing whole,
The least confusion but in one, not all
That system only, but the whole must fall.
Let earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly,
Planets and suns run lawless through the sky;
Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurl'd,
Being on being wreck'd, and world on world;
Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod,
And nature tremble to the throne of God.
All this dread order break—for whom? for thee?
Vile worm!—Oh madness, pride, impiety!

IX.
    What if the foot ordain'd the dust to tread,
Or hand to toil, aspir'd to be the head?
What if the head, the eye, or ear repin'd
To serve mere engines to the ruling mind?
Just as absurd for any part to claim
To be another, in this gen'ral frame:
Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,
The great directing Mind of All ordains.

    All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;
That, chang'd through all, and yet in all the same,
Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame,
Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,
Lives through all life, extends through all extent,
Spreads undivided, operates unspent,
Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,
As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;
As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,
As the rapt seraph that adores and burns;
To him no high, no low, no great, no small;
He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.

X.
    Cease then, nor order imperfection name:
Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.
Know thy own point: This kind, this due degree
Of blindness, weakness, Heav'n bestows on thee.
Submit.—In this, or any other sphere,
Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:
Safe in the hand of one disposing pow'r,
Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.
All nature is but art, unknown to thee;
All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;
All discord, harmony, not understood;
All partial evil, universal good:
And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,
One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Nature', 'Religion', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44899/an-essay-on-man-epistle-i,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,An Essay on Man: Epistle II,"I.
    Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;
The proper study of mankind is man.
Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state,
A being darkly wise, and rudely great:
With too much knowledge for the sceptic side,
With too much weakness for the stoic's pride,
He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;
In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast;
In doubt his mind or body to prefer;
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;
Alike in ignorance, his reason such,
Whether he thinks too little, or too much:
Chaos of thought and passion, all confus'd;
Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd;
Created half to rise, and half to fall;
Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;
Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd:
The glory, jest, and riddle of the world!

    Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides,
Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;
Instruct the planets in what orbs to run,
Correct old time, and regulate the sun;
Go, soar with Plato to th' empyreal sphere,
To the first good, first perfect, and first fair;
Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs trod,
And quitting sense call imitating God;
As Eastern priests in giddy circles run,
And turn their heads to imitate the sun.
Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule—
Then drop into thyself, and be a fool!

    Superior beings, when of late they saw
A mortal Man unfold all Nature's law,
Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly shape,
And showed a Newton as we shew an Ape.

    Could he, whose rules the rapid comet bind,
Describe or fix one movement of his mind?
Who saw its fires here rise, and there descend,
Explain his own beginning, or his end?
Alas what wonder! Man's superior part
Uncheck'd may rise, and climb from art to art;
But when his own great work is but begun,
What Reason weaves, by Passion is undone.

    Trace science then, with modesty thy guide;
First strip off all her equipage of pride;
Deduct what is but vanity, or dress,
Or learning's luxury, or idleness;
Or tricks to show the stretch of human brain,
Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain;
Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent parts
Of all our Vices have created Arts;
Then see how little the remaining sum,
Which serv'd the past, and must the times to come!

II.
    Two principles in human nature reign;
Self-love, to urge, and reason, to restrain;
Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call,
Each works its end, to move or govern all:
And to their proper operation still,
Ascribe all good; to their improper, ill.

    Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;
Reason's comparing balance rules the whole.
Man, but for that, no action could attend,
And but for this, were active to no end:
Fix'd like a plant on his peculiar spot,
To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot;
Or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void,
Destroying others, by himself destroy'd.

    Most strength the moving principle requires;
Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires.
Sedate and quiet the comparing lies,
Form'd but to check, delib'rate, and advise.
Self-love still stronger, as its objects nigh;
Reason's at distance, and in prospect lie:
That sees immediate good by present sense;
Reason, the future and the consequence.
Thicker than arguments, temptations throng,
At best more watchful this, but that more strong.
The action of the stronger to suspend,
Reason still use, to reason still attend.
Attention, habit and experience gains;
Each strengthens reason, and self-love restrains.

    Let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight,
More studious to divide than to unite,
And grace and virtue, sense and reason split,
With all the rash dexterity of wit:
Wits, just like fools, at war about a name,
Have full as oft no meaning, or the same.
Self-love and reason to one end aspire,
Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire;
But greedy that its object would devour,
This taste the honey, and not wound the flow'r:
Pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood,
Our greatest evil, or our greatest good.

III.
    Modes of self-love the passions we may call:
'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all:
But since not every good we can divide,
And reason bids us for our own provide;
Passions, though selfish, if their means be fair,
List under reason, and deserve her care;
Those, that imparted, court a nobler aim,
Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name.

    In lazy apathy let Stoics boast
Their virtue fix'd, 'tis fix'd as in a frost;
Contracted all, retiring to the breast;
But strength of mind is exercise, not rest:
The rising tempest puts in act the soul,
Parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole.
On life's vast ocean diversely we sail,
Reason the card, but passion is the gale;
Nor God alone in the still calm we find,
He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.

    Passions, like elements, though born to fight,
Yet, mix'd and soften'd, in his work unite:
These 'tis enough to temper and employ;
But what composes man, can man destroy?
Suffice that reason keep to nature's road,
Subject, compound them, follow her and God.
Love, hope, and joy, fair pleasure's smiling train,
Hate, fear, and grief, the family of pain,
These mix'd with art, and to due bounds confin'd,
Make and maintain the balance of the mind:
The lights and shades, whose well accorded strife
Gives all the strength and colour of our life.

    Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes,
And when in act they cease, in prospect, rise:
Present to grasp, and future still to find,
The whole employ of body and of mind.
All spread their charms, but charm not all alike;
On diff'rent senses diff'rent objects strike;
Hence diff'rent passions more or less inflame,
As strong or weak, the organs of the frame;
And hence one master passion in the breast,
Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest.

    As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath,
Receives the lurking principle of death;
The young disease, that must subdue at length,
Grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength:
So, cast and mingled with his very frame,
The mind's disease, its ruling passion came;
Each vital humour which should feed the whole,
Soon flows to this, in body and in soul.
Whatever warms the heart, or fills the head,
As the mind opens, and its functions spread,
Imagination plies her dang'rous art,
And pours it all upon the peccant part.

    Nature its mother, habit is its nurse;
Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse;
Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r;
As Heav'n's blest beam turns vinegar more sour.
We, wretched subjects, though to lawful sway,
In this weak queen some fav'rite still obey:
Ah! if she lend not arms, as well as rules,
What can she more than tell us we are fools?
Teach us to mourn our nature, not to mend,
A sharp accuser, but a helpless friend!
Or from a judge turn pleader, to persuade
The choice we make, or justify it made;
Proud of an easy conquest all along,
She but removes weak passions for the strong:
So, when small humours gather to a gout,
The doctor fancies he has driv'n them out.

    Yes, nature's road must ever be preferr'd;
Reason is here no guide, but still a guard:
'Tis hers to rectify, not overthrow,
And treat this passion more as friend than foe:
A mightier pow'r the strong direction sends,
And sev'ral men impels to sev'ral ends.
Like varying winds, by other passions toss'd,
This drives them constant to a certain coast.
Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, please,
Or (oft more strong than all) the love of ease;
Through life 'tis followed, ev'n at life's expense;
The merchant's toil, the sage's indolence,
The monk's humility, the hero's pride,
All, all alike, find reason on their side.

    Th' eternal art educing good from ill,
Grafts on this passion our best principle:
'Tis thus the mercury of man is fix'd,
Strong grows the virtue with his nature mix'd;
The dross cements what else were too refin'd,
And in one interest body acts with mind.

    As fruits, ungrateful to the planter's care,
On savage stocks inserted, learn to bear;
The surest virtues thus from passions shoot,
Wild nature's vigor working at the root.
What crops of wit and honesty appear
From spleen, from obstinacy, hate, or fear!
See anger, zeal and fortitude supply;
Ev'n av'rice, prudence; sloth, philosophy;
Lust, through some certain strainers well refin'd,
Is gentle love, and charms all womankind;
Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave,
Is emulation in the learn'd or brave;
Nor virtue, male or female, can we name,
But what will grow on pride, or grow on shame.

    Thus nature gives us (let it check our pride)
The virtue nearest to our vice allied:
Reason the byass turns to good from ill,
And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will.
The fiery soul abhorr'd in Catiline,
In Decius charms, in Curtius is divine:
The same ambition can destroy or save,
And make a patriot as it makes a knave.

IV.
    This light and darkness in our chaos join'd,
What shall divide? The God within the mind.

    Extremes in nature equal ends produce,
In man they join to some mysterious use;
Though each by turns the other's bound invade,
As, in some well-wrought picture, light and shade,
And oft so mix, the diff'rence is too nice
Where ends the virtue, or begins the vice.

    Fools! who from hence into the notion fall,
That vice or virtue there is none at all.
If white and black blend, soften, and unite
A thousand ways, is there no black or white?
Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain;
'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain.

V.
    Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
But where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed:
Ask where's the North? at York, 'tis on the Tweed;
In Scotland, at the Orcades; and there,
At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where:
No creature owns it in the first degree,
But thinks his neighbour farther gone than he!
Ev'n those who dwell beneath its very zone,
Or never feel the rage, or never own;
What happier natures shrink at with affright,
The hard inhabitant contends is right.

VI.
    Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be,
Few in th' extreme, but all in the degree;
The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise;
And ev'n the best, by fits, what they despise.
'Tis but by parts we follow good or ill,
For, vice or virtue, self directs it still;
Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal;
But heav'n's great view is one, and that the whole:
That counterworks each folly and caprice;
That disappoints th' effect of ev'ry vice;
That, happy frailties to all ranks applied,
Shame to the virgin, to the matron pride,
Fear to the statesman, rashness to the chief,
To kings presumption, and to crowds belief,
That, virtue's ends from vanity can raise,
Which seeks no int'rest, no reward but praise;
And build on wants, and on defects of mind,
The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind.

    Heav'n forming each on other to depend,
A master, or a servant, or a friend,
Bids each on other for assistance call,
'Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all.
Wants, frailties, passions, closer still ally
The common int'rest, or endear the tie:
To these we owe true friendship, love sincere,
Each home-felt joy that life inherits here;
Yet from the same we learn, in its decline,
Those joys, those loves, those int'rests to resign;
Taught half by reason, half by mere decay,
To welcome death, and calmly pass away.

    Whate'er the passion, knowledge, fame, or pelf,
Not one will change his neighbour with himself.
The learn'd is happy nature to explore,
The fool is happy that he knows no more;
The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n,
The poor contents him with the care of heav'n.
See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing,
The sot a hero, lunatic a king;
The starving chemist in his golden views
Supremely blest, the poet in his Muse.

    See some strange comfort ev'ry state attend,
And pride bestow'd on all, a common friend;
See some fit passion ev'ry age supply,
Hope travels through, nor quits us when we die.

    Behold the child, by nature's kindly law,
Pleas'd with a rattle, tickl'd with a straw:
Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight,
A little louder, but as empty quite:
Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage,
And beads and pray'r books are the toys of age:
Pleas'd with this bauble still, as that before;
'Till tir'd he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er!

    Meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays
Those painted clouds that beautify our days;
Each want of happiness by hope supplied,
And each vacuity of sense by Pride:
These build as fast as knowledge can destroy;
In folly's cup still laughs the bubble, joy;
One prospect lost, another still we gain;
And not a vanity is giv'n in vain;
Ev'n mean self-love becomes, by force divine,
The scale to measure others' wants by thine.
See! and confess, one comfort still must rise,
'Tis this: Though man's a fool, yet God is wise.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Nature', 'Religion', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44900/an-essay-on-man-epistle-ii,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Epistles to Several Persons: Epistle II: To a Lady on the Characters of Women,"Nothing so true as what you once let fall,
""Most Women have no Characters at all.""
Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear,
And best distinguish'd by black, brown, or fair.

     How many pictures of one nymph we view,
All how unlike each other, all how true!
Arcadia's Countess, here, in ermin'd pride,
Is, there, Pastora by a fountain side.
Here Fannia, leering on her own good man,
And there, a naked Leda with a Swan.
Let then the Fair one beautifully cry,
In Magdalen's loose hair and lifted eye,
Or dress'd in smiles of sweet Cecilia shine,
With simp'ring angels, palms, and harps divine;
Whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it,
If folly grows romantic, I must paint it.

     Come then, the colours and the ground prepare!
Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air;
Choose a firm cloud, before it fall, and in it
Catch, ere she change, the Cynthia of this minute.

     Rufa, whose eye quick-glancing o'er the park,
Attracts each light gay meteor of a spark,
Agrees as ill with Rufa studying Locke,
As Sappho's diamonds with her dirty smock;
Or Sappho at her toilet's greasy task,
With Sappho fragrant at an ev'ning Masque:
So morning insects that in muck begun,
Shine, buzz, and flyblow in the setting sun.

     How soft is Silia! fearful to offend;
The frail one's advocate, the weak one's friend:
To her, Calista prov'd her conduct nice,
And good Simplicius asks of her advice.
Sudden, she storms! she raves! You tip the wink,
But spare your censure; Silia does not drink.
All eyes may see from what the change arose,
All eyes may see—a pimple on her nose.

     Papillia, wedded to her doating spark,
Sighs for the shades—""How charming is a park!""
A park is purchas'd, but the fair he sees
All bath'd in tears—""Oh, odious, odious trees!""

     Ladies, like variegated tulips, show,
'Tis to their changes that their charms they owe;
Their happy spots the nice admirer take,
Fine by defect, and delicately weak.
'Twas thus Calypso once each heart alarm'd,
Aw'd without virtue, without beauty charm'd;
Her tongue bewitch'd as oddly as her eyes,
Less wit than mimic, more a wit than wise;
Strange graces still, and stranger flights she had,
Was just not ugly, and was just not mad;
Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create,
As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate.

     Narcissa's nature, tolerably mild,
To make a wash, would hardly stew a child;
Has ev'n been prov'd to grant a lover's pray'r,
And paid a tradesman once to make him stare,
Gave alms at Easter, in a Christian trim,
And made a widow happy, for a whim.
Why then declare good nature is her scorn,
When 'tis by that alone she can be borne?
Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?
A fool to pleasure, yet a slave to fame:
Now deep in Taylor and the Book of Martyrs
Now drinking citron with his Grace and Chartres.
Now conscience chills her, and now passion burns;
And atheism and religion take their turns;
A very heathen in the carnal part,
Yet still a sad, good Christian at her heart.

     See Sin in State, majestically drunk;
Proud as a peeress, prouder as a punk;
Chaste to her husband, frank to all beside,
A teeming mistress, but a barren bride.
What then? let blood and body bear the fault,
Her head's untouch'd, that noble seat of thought:
Such this day's doctrine—in another fit
She sins with poets through pure love of wit.
What has not fir'd her bosom or her brain?
Caesar and Tallboy, Charles and Charlema'ne.
As Helluo, late dictator of the feast,
The nose of hautgout, and the tip of taste,
Critiqu'd your wine, and analys'd your meat,
Yet on plain pudding deign'd at home to eat;
So Philomede, lect'ring all mankind
On the soft passion, and the taste refin'd,
Th' address, the delicacy—stoops at once,
And makes her hearty meal upon a dunce.

     Flavia's a wit, has too much sense to pray,
To Toast our wants and wishes, is her way;
Nor asks of God, but of her stars to give
The mighty blessing, ""while we live, to live.""
Then all for death, that opiate of the soul!
Lucretia's dagger, Rosamonda's bowl.
Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?
A spark too fickle, or a spouse too kind.
Wise wretch! with pleasures too refin'd to please;
With too much spirit to be e'er at ease;
With too much quickness ever to be taught;
With too much thinking to have common thought:
You purchase pain with all that joy can give,
And die of nothing but a rage to live.

     Turn then from wits; and look on Simo's mate,
No ass so meek, no ass so obstinate:
Or her, that owns her faults, but never mends,
Because she's honest, and the best of friends:
Or her, whose life the Church and scandal share,
For ever in a passion, or a prayer:
Or her, who laughs at Hell, but (like her Grace)
Cries, ""Ah! how charming, if there's no such place!""
Or who in sweet vicissitude appears
Of mirth and opium, ratafie and tears,
The daily anodyne, and nightly draught,
To kill those foes to fair ones, time and thought.
Woman and fool are two hard things to hit,
For true no-meaning puzzles more than wit.

     But what are these to great Atossa's mind?
Scarce once herself, by turns all womankind!
Who, with herself, or others, from her birth
Finds all her life one warfare upon earth:
Shines, in exposing knaves, and painting fools,
Yet is, whate'er she hates and ridicules.
No thought advances, but her eddy brain
Whisks it about, and down it goes again.
Full sixty years the world has been her trade,
The wisest fool much time has ever made.
From loveless youth to unrespected age,
No passion gratified except her rage.
So much the fury still outran the wit,
The pleasure miss'd her, and the scandal hit.
Who breaks with her,-provokes revenge from Hell,
But he's a bolder man who dares be well.
Her every turn with violence pursu'd,
Nor more a storm her hate than gratitude.
To that each passion turns, or soon or late;
Love, if it makes her yield, must make her hate:
Superiors? death! and equals? what a curse!
But an inferior not dependant? worse.
Offend her, and she knows not to forgive;
Oblige her, and she'll hate you while you live:
But die, and she'll adore you—Then the Bust
And Temple rise—then fall again to dust.
Last night, her Lord was all that's good and great;
A knave this morning, and his will a cheat.
Strange! by the means defeated of the ends,
By spirit robb'd of pow'r, by warmth of friends,
By wealth of follow'rs! without one distress
Sick of herself through very selfishness!
Atossa, curs'd with ev'ry granted pray'r,
Childless with all her children, wants an heir.
To heirs unknown descends th' unguarded store,
Or wanders, heav'n-directed, to the poor.

     Pictures like these, dear Madam, to design,
Asks no firm hand, and no unerring line;
Some wand'ring touch or some reflected light,
Some flying stroke alone can hit 'em right:
For how should equal colours do the knack?
Chameleons who can paint in white and black?

     ""Yet Chloe sure was form'd without a spot""—
Nature in her then err'd not, but forgot.
""With ev'ry pleasing, ev'ry prudent part,
Say, what can Chloe want?""—She wants a heart.
She speaks, behaves, and acts just as she ought;
But never, never, reach'd one gen'rous thought.
Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour,
Content to dwell in decencies for ever.
So very reasonable, so unmov'd,
As never yet to love, or to be lov'd.
She, while her lover pants upon her breast,
Can mark the figures on an Indian chest;
And when she sees her friend in deep despair,
Observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair.
Forbid it heav'n, a favour or a debt
She e'er should cancel—but she may forget.
Safe is your secret still in Chloe's ear;
But none of Chloe's shall you ever hear.
Of all her dears she never slander'd one,
But cares not if a thousand are undone.
Would Chloe know if you're alive or dead?
She bids her footman put it in her head.
Chloe is prudent—would you too be wise?
Then never break your heart when Chloe dies.

     One certain portrait may (I grant) be seen,
Which Heav'n has varnish'd out, and made a  Queen :
The same for ever! and describ'd by all
With truth and goodness, as with crown and ball.
Poets heap virtues, painters gems at will,
And show their zeal, and hide their want of skill.
'Tis well—but, artists! who can paint or write,
To draw the naked is your true delight.
That robe of quality so struts and swells,
None see what parts of nature it conceals.
Th' exactest traits of body or of mind,
We owe to models of an humble kind.
If Queensbury to strip there's no compelling,
'Tis from a handmaid we must take a Helen.
From peer or bishop 'tis no easy thing
To draw the man who loves his God, or King:
Alas! I copy (or my draught would fail)
From honest Mah'met, or plain Parson Hale.

     But grant, in public men sometimes are shown,
A woman's seen in private life alone:
Our bolder talents in full light display'd;
Your virtues open fairest in the shade.
Bred to disguise, in public 'tis you hide;
There, none distinguish twixt your shame or pride,
Weakness or delicacy; all so nice,
That each may seem a virtue, or a vice.

     In men, we various ruling passions find;
In women, two almost divide the kind;
Those, only fix'd, they first or last obey,
The love of pleasure, and the love of sway.
That, Nature gives; and where the lesson taught
Is still to please, can pleasure seem a fault?
Experience, this; by man's oppression curs'd,
They seek the second not to lose the first.

     Men, some to bus'ness, some to pleasure take;
But ev'ry woman is at heart a rake:
Men, some to quiet, some to public strife;
But ev'ry Lady would be queen for life.

     Yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens!
Pow'r all their end, but beauty all the means.
In youth they conquer, with so wild a rage,
As leaves them scarce a subject in their age:
For foreign glory, foreign joy, they roam;
No thought of peace or happiness at home.
But wisdom's triumph is well-tim'd retreat,
As hard a science to the fair as great!
Beauties, like tyrants, old and friendless grown,
Yet hate repose, and dread to be alone,
Worn out in public, weary ev'ry eye,
Nor leave one sigh behind them when they die.

     Pleasures the sex, as children birds, pursue,
Still out of reach, yet never out of view;
Sure, if they catch, to spoil the toy at most,
To covet flying, and regret when lost:
At last, to follies youth could scarce defend,
It grows their age's prudence to pretend;
Asham'd to own they gave delight before,
Reduc'd to feign it, when they give no more:
As hags hold sabbaths, less for joy than spite,
So these their merry, miserable night;
Still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide,
And haunt the places where their honour died.

     See how the world its veterans rewards!
A youth of frolics, an old age of cards;
Fair to no purpose, artful to no end,
Young without lovers, old without a friend,
A fop their passion, but their prize a sot,
Alive, ridiculous, and dead, forgot!

     Ah, Friend! to dazzle let the vain design,
To raise the thought and touch the heart, be thine!
That charm shall grow, while what fatigues the Ring,
Flaunts and goes down, an unregarded thing:
So when the sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight,
All mild ascends the moon's more sober light,
Serene in virgin modesty she shines,
And unobserv'd the glaring orb declines.

     Oh! blest with temper, whose unclouded ray
Can make tomorrow cheerful as today;
She, who can love a sister's charms, or hear
Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear;
She, who ne'er answers till a husband cools,
Or, if she rules him, never shows she rules;
Charms by accepting, by submitting sways,
Yet has her humour most, when she obeys;
Let fops or fortune fly which way they will;
Disdains all loss of tickets, or codille;
Spleen, vapours, or smallpox, above them all,
And mistress of herself, though China fall.

     And yet, believe me, good as well as ill,
Woman's at best a contradiction still.
Heav'n, when it strives to polish all it can
Its last best work, but forms a softer man;
Picks from each sex, to make the fav'rite blest,
Your love of pleasure, our desire of rest:
Blends, in exception to all gen'ral rules,
Your taste of follies, with our scorn of fools:
Reserve with frankness, art with truth allied,
Courage with softness, modesty with pride,
Fix'd principles, with fancy ever new;
Shakes all together, and produces—You.

     Be this a woman's fame: with this unblest,
Toasts live a scorn, and queens may die a jest.
This Phoebus promis'd (I forget the year)
When those blue eyes first open'd on the sphere;
Ascendant Phoebus watch'd that hour with care,
Averted half your parents' simple pray'r,
And gave you beauty, but denied the pelf
Which buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself.
The gen'rous God, who wit and gold refines,
And ripens spirits as he ripens mines,
Kept dross for duchesses, the world shall know it,
To you gave sense, good humour, and a poet.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'Epistle', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44893/epistles-to-several-persons-epistle-ii-to-a-lady-on-the-characters-of-women,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,"Neque sermonibus vulgi dederis te, nec in præmiis spem posueris rerum tuarum; suis te oportet illecebris ipsa virtus trahat ad verum decus. Quid de te alii loquantur, ipsi videant, sed loquentur tamen. 
(Cicero, De Re Publica VI.23) 
 
[""... you will not any longer attend to the vulgar mob's gossip nor put your trust in human rewards for your deeds; virtue, through her own charms, should lead you to true glory. Let what others say about you be their concern; whatever it is, they will say it anyway.""]

Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd, I said, 
Tie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead. 
The dog-star rages! nay 'tis past a doubt, 
All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out: 
Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand, 
They rave, recite, and madden round the land. 
 
       What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide? 
They pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide; 
By land, by water, they renew the charge; 
They stop the chariot, and they board the barge. 
No place is sacred, not the church is free; 
Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me: 
Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme, 
Happy! to catch me just at dinner-time. 
 
       Is there a parson, much bemus'd in beer, 
A maudlin poetess, a rhyming peer, 
A clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross, 
Who pens a stanza, when he should engross? 
Is there, who, lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls 
With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls? 
All fly to Twit'nam, and in humble strain 
Apply to me, to keep them mad or vain. 
Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws, 
Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause: 
Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope, 
And curses wit, and poetry, and Pope. 
 
       Friend to my life! (which did not you prolong, 
The world had wanted many an idle song) 
What drop or nostrum can this plague remove? 
Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love? 
A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped, 
If foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead. 
Seiz'd and tied down to judge, how wretched I! 
Who can't be silent, and who will not lie; 
To laugh, were want of goodness and of grace, 
And to be grave, exceeds all pow'r of face. 
I sit with sad civility, I read 
With honest anguish, and an aching head; 
And drop at last, but in unwilling ears, 
This saving counsel, ""Keep your piece nine years."" 
 
       ""Nine years!"" cries he, who high in Drury-lane 
Lull'd by soft zephyrs through the broken pane, 
Rhymes ere he wakes, and prints before Term ends, 
Oblig'd by hunger, and request of friends: 
""The piece, you think, is incorrect: why, take it, 
I'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it."" 
 
       Three things another's modest wishes bound, 
My friendship, and a prologue, and ten pound. 
       Pitholeon sends to me: ""You know his Grace, 
I want a patron; ask him for a place."" 
 
       Pitholeon libell'd me—""but here's a letter 
Informs you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better. 
Dare you refuse him? Curll invites to dine, 
He'll write a Journal, or he'll turn Divine."" 
 
       Bless me! a packet—""'Tis a stranger sues, 
A virgin tragedy, an orphan muse."" 
If I dislike it, ""Furies, death and rage!"" 
If I approve, ""Commend it to the stage."" 
There (thank my stars) my whole commission ends, 
The play'rs and I are, luckily, no friends. 
Fir'd that the house reject him, ""'Sdeath I'll print it, 
And shame the fools—your int'rest, sir, with Lintot!"" 
""Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much."" 
""Not, sir, if you revise it, and retouch."" 
All my demurs but double his attacks; 
At last he whispers, ""Do; and we go snacks."" 
Glad of a quarrel, straight I clap the door, 
""Sir, let me see your works and you no more."" 
 
       'Tis sung, when Midas' ears began to spring, 
(Midas, a sacred person and a king) 
His very minister who spied them first, 
(Some say his queen) was forc'd to speak, or burst. 
And is not mine, my friend, a sorer case, 
When ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face? 
 
       ""Good friend, forbear! you deal in dang'rous things. 
I'd never name queens, ministers, or kings; 
Keep close to ears, and those let asses prick; 
'Tis nothing""—Nothing? if they bite and kick? 
Out with it,  Dunciad! let the secret pass, 
That secret to each fool, that he's an ass: 
The truth once told (and wherefore should we lie?) 
The queen of Midas slept, and so may I. 
 
       You think this cruel? take it for a rule, 
No creature smarts so little as a fool. 
Let peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break, 
Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crack: 
Pit, box, and gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd, 
Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world. 
Who shames a scribbler? break one cobweb through, 
He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew; 
Destroy his fib or sophistry, in vain, 
The creature's at his dirty work again; 
Thron'd in the centre of his thin designs; 
Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines! 
Whom have I hurt? has poet yet, or peer, 
Lost the arch'd eye-brow, or Parnassian sneer? 
And has not Colley still his lord, and whore? 
His butchers Henley, his Free-masons Moore? 
Does not one table Bavius still admit? 
Still to one bishop Philips seem a wit? 
Still Sappho— ""Hold! for God-sake—you'll offend: 
No names!—be calm!—learn prudence of a friend! 
I too could write, and I am twice as tall; 
But foes like these!"" One flatt'rer's worse than all. 
Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right, 
It is the slaver kills, and not the bite. 
A fool quite angry is quite innocent; 
Alas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent. 
 
       One dedicates in high heroic prose, 
And ridicules beyond a hundred foes; 
One from all Grub Street will my fame defend, 
And, more abusive, calls himself my friend. 
This prints my Letters, that expects a bribe, 
And others roar aloud, ""Subscribe, subscribe."" 
 
       There are, who to my person pay their court: 
I cough like Horace, and, though lean, am short, 
Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high, 
Such Ovid's nose, and ""Sir! you have an eye""— 
Go on, obliging creatures, make me see 
All that disgrac'd my betters, met in me: 
Say for my comfort, languishing in bed, 
""Just so immortal Maro held his head:"" 
And when I die, be sure you let me know 
Great Homer died three thousand years ago. 
 
       Why did I write? what sin to me unknown 
Dipp'd me in ink, my parents', or my own? 
As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame, 
I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came. 
I left no calling for this idle trade, 
No duty broke, no father disobey'd. 
The Muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not wife, 
To help me through this long disease, my life, 
To second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care, 
And teach the being you preserv'd, to bear. 
 
       But why then publish? Granville the polite, 
And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write; 
Well-natur'd Garth inflamed with early praise, 
And Congreve lov'd, and Swift endur'd my lays; 
The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read, 
Ev'n mitred Rochester would nod the head, 
And St. John's self (great Dryden's friends before) 
With open arms receiv'd one poet more. 
Happy my studies, when by these approv'd! 
Happier their author, when by these belov'd! 
From these the world will judge of men and books, 
Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cookes. 
 
       Soft were my numbers; who could take offence, 
While pure description held the place of sense? 
Like gentle Fanny's was my flow'ry theme, 
A painted mistress, or a purling stream. 
Yet then did Gildon draw his venal quill; 
I wish'd the man a dinner, and sat still. 
Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret; 
I never answer'd, I was not in debt. 
If want provok'd, or madness made them print, 
I wag'd no war with Bedlam or the Mint. 
 
       Did some more sober critic come abroad? 
If wrong, I smil'd; if right, I kiss'd the rod. 
Pains, reading, study, are their just pretence, 
And all they want is spirit, taste, and sense. 
Commas and points they set exactly right, 
And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite. 
Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds, 
From slashing Bentley down to pidling Tibbalds. 
Each wight who reads not, and but scans and spells, 
Each word-catcher that lives on syllables, 
Ev'n such small critics some regard may claim, 
Preserv'd in Milton's or in Shakespeare's name. 
Pretty! in amber to observe the forms 
Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms; 
The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, 
But wonder how the devil they got there? 
 
       Were others angry? I excus'd them too; 
Well might they rage; I gave them but their due. 
A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find, 
But each man's secret standard in his mind, 
That casting weight pride adds to emptiness, 
This, who can gratify? for who can guess? 
The bard whom pilfer'd pastorals renown, 
Who turns a Persian tale for half a crown, 
Just writes to make his barrenness appear, 
And strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year: 
He, who still wanting, though he lives on theft, 
Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left: 
And he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning, 
Means not, but blunders round about a meaning: 
And he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad, 
It is not poetry, but prose run mad: 
All these, my modest satire bade translate, 
And own'd, that nine such poets made a Tate. 
How did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe? 
And swear, not Addison himself was safe. 
 
       Peace to all such! but were there one whose fires 
True genius kindles, and fair fame inspires, 
Blest with each talent and each art to please, 
And born to write, converse, and live with ease: 
Should such a man, too fond to rule alone, 
Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne, 
View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes, 
And hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise; 
Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, 
And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer; 
Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike, 
Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike; 
Alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend, 
A tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend; 
Dreading ev'n fools, by flatterers besieg'd, 
And so obliging, that he ne'er oblig'd; 
Like Cato, give his little senate laws, 
And sit attentive to his own applause; 
While wits and templars ev'ry sentence raise, 
And wonder with a foolish face of praise. 
Who but must laugh, if such a man there be? 
Who would not weep, if Atticus were he? 
 
       What though my name stood rubric on the walls, 
Or plaister'd posts, with claps, in capitals? 
Or smoking forth, a hundred hawkers' load, 
On wings of winds came flying all abroad? 
I sought no homage from the race that write; 
I kept, like Asian monarchs, from their sight: 
Poems I heeded (now berhym'd so long) 
No more than thou, great George! a birthday song. 
I ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days, 
To spread about the itch of verse and praise; 
Nor like a puppy, daggled through the town, 
To fetch and carry sing-song up and down; 
Nor at rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cried, 
With handkerchief and orange at my side; 
But sick of fops, and poetry, and prate, 
To Bufo left the whole Castalian state. 
 
       Proud as Apollo on his forked hill, 
Sat full-blown Bufo, puff'd by every quill; 
Fed with soft dedication all day long, 
Horace and he went hand in hand in song. 
His library (where busts of poets dead 
And a true Pindar stood without a head,) 
Receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race, 
Who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place: 
Much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat, 
And flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat: 
Till grown more frugal in his riper days, 
He paid some bards with port, and some with praise, 
To some a dry rehearsal was assign'd, 
And others (harder still) he paid in kind. 
Dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh, 
Dryden alone escap'd this judging eye: 
But still the great have kindness in reserve, 
He help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve. 
 
       May some choice patron bless each grey goose quill! 
May ev'ry Bavius have his Bufo still! 
So, when a statesman wants a day's defence, 
Or envy holds a whole week's war with sense, 
Or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands, 
May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands! 
Blest be the great! for those they take away, 
And those they left me—for they left me Gay; 
Left me to see neglected genius bloom, 
Neglected die! and tell it on his tomb; 
Of all thy blameless life the sole return 
My verse, and Queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn! 
 
       Oh let me live my own! and die so too! 
(""To live and die is all I have to do:"") 
Maintain a poet's dignity and ease, 
And see what friends, and read what books I please. 
Above a patron, though I condescend 
Sometimes to call a minister my friend: 
I was not born for courts or great affairs; 
I pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs; 
Can sleep without a poem in my head, 
Nor know, if Dennis be alive or dead. 
 
       Why am I ask'd what next shall see the light? 
Heav'ns! was I born for nothing but to write? 
Has life no joys for me? or (to be grave) 
Have I no friend to serve, no soul to save? 
""I found him close with Swift""—""Indeed? no doubt"", 
(Cries prating Balbus) ""something will come out"". 
'Tis all in vain, deny it as I will. 
""No, such a genius never can lie still,"" 
And then for mine obligingly mistakes 
The first lampoon Sir Will. or Bubo makes. 
Poor guiltless I! and can I choose but smile, 
When ev'ry coxcomb knows me by my style? 
 
       Curs'd be the verse, how well soe'er it flow, 
That tends to make one worthy man my foe, 
Give virtue scandal, innocence a fear, 
Or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear! 
But he, who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace, 
Insults fall'n worth, or beauty in distress, 
Who loves a lie, lame slander helps about, 
Who writes a libel, or who copies out: 
That fop, whose pride affects a patron's name, 
Yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame; 
Who can your merit selfishly approve, 
And show the sense of it without the love; 
Who has the vanity to call you friend, 
Yet wants the honour, injur'd, to defend; 
Who tells what'er you think, whate'er you say, 
And, if he lie not, must at least betray: 
Who to the Dean, and silver bell can swear, 
And sees at Cannons what was never there; 
Who reads, but with a lust to misapply, 
Make satire a lampoon, and fiction, lie. 
A lash like mine no honest man shall dread, 
But all such babbling blockheads in his stead. 
 
       Let Sporus tremble—""What? that thing of silk, 
Sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk? 
Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel? 
Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?"" 
Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings, 
This painted child of dirt that stinks and stings; 
Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys, 
Yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'r enjoys, 
So well-bred spaniels civilly delight 
In mumbling of the game they dare not bite. 
Eternal smiles his emptiness betray, 
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way. 
Whether in florid impotence he speaks, 
And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks; 
Or at the ear of Eve, familiar toad, 
Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad, 
In puns, or politics, or tales, or lies, 
Or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies. 
His wit all see-saw, between  that and  this , 
Now high, now low, now Master up, now Miss, 
And he himself one vile antithesis. 
Amphibious thing! that acting either part, 
The trifling head, or the corrupted heart, 
Fop at the toilet, flatt'rer at the board, 
Now trips a lady, and now struts a lord. 
Eve's tempter thus the rabbins have express'd, 
A cherub's face, a reptile all the rest; 
Beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust, 
Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust. 
 
       Not fortune's worshipper, nor fashion's fool, 
Not lucre's madman, nor ambition's tool, 
Not proud, nor servile, be one poet's praise, 
That, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways; 
That flatt'ry, even to kings, he held a shame, 
And thought a lie in verse or prose the same: 
That not in fancy's maze he wander'd long, 
But stoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his song: 
That not for fame, but virtue's better end, 
He stood the furious foe, the timid friend, 
The damning critic, half-approving wit, 
The coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit; 
Laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had, 
The dull, the proud, the wicked, and the mad; 
The distant threats of vengeance on his head, 
The blow unfelt, the tear he never shed; 
The tale reviv'd, the lie so oft o'erthrown; 
Th' imputed trash, and dulness not his own; 
The morals blacken'd when the writings 'scape; 
The libell'd person, and the pictur'd shape; 
Abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him, spread, 
A friend in exile, or a father, dead; 
The whisper, that to greatness still too near, 
Perhaps, yet vibrates on his sovereign's ear:— 
Welcome for thee, fair Virtue! all the past: 
For thee, fair Virtue! welcome ev'n the last! 
 
       ""But why insult the poor? affront the great?"" 
A knave's a knave, to me, in ev'ry state: 
Alike my scorn, if he succeed or fail, 
Sporus at court, or Japhet in a jail, 
A hireling scribbler, or a hireling peer, 
Knight of the post corrupt, or of the shire; 
If on a pillory, or near a throne, 
He gain his prince's ear, or lose his own. 
 
       Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit, 
Sappho can tell you how this man was bit: 
This dreaded sat'rist Dennis will confess 
Foe to his pride, but friend to his distress: 
So humble, he has knock'd at Tibbald's door, 
Has drunk with Cibber, nay, has rhym'd for Moore. 
Full ten years slander'd, did he once reply? 
Three thousand suns went down on Welsted's lie. 
To please a mistress one aspers'd his life; 
He lash'd him not, but let her be his wife. 
Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on his quill, 
And write whate'er he pleas'd, except his will; 
Let the two Curlls of town and court, abuse 
His father, mother, body, soul, and muse. 
Yet why? that father held it for a rule, 
It was a sin to call our neighbour fool: 
That harmless mother thought no wife a whore,— 
Hear this! and spare his family, James Moore! 
Unspotted names! and memorable long, 
If there be force in virtue, or in song. 
 
       Of gentle blood (part shed in honour's cause, 
While yet in Britain honour had applause) 
Each parent sprung—""What fortune, pray?""—Their own, 
And better got, than Bestia's from the throne. 
Born to no pride, inheriting no strife, 
Nor marrying discord in a noble wife, 
Stranger to civil and religious rage, 
The good man walk'd innoxious through his age. 
No courts he saw, no suits would ever try, 
Nor dar'd an oath, nor hazarded a lie: 
Un-learn'd, he knew no schoolman's subtle art, 
No language, but the language of the heart. 
By nature honest, by experience wise, 
Healthy by temp'rance and by exercise; 
His life, though long, to sickness past unknown; 
His death was instant, and without a groan. 
O grant me, thus to live, and thus to die! 
Who sprung from kings shall know less joy than I. 
 
       O friend! may each domestic bliss be thine! 
Be no unpleasing melancholy mine: 
Me, let the tender office long engage 
To rock the cradle of reposing age, 
With lenient arts extend a mother's breath, 
Make langour smile, and smooth the bed of death, 
Explore the thought, explain the asking eye, 
And keep a while one parent from the sky! 
On cares like these if length of days attend, 
May Heav'n, to bless those days, preserve my friend, 
Preserve him social, cheerful, and serene, 
And just as rich as when he serv'd a queen.

Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Imitations of Horace,"Ne Rubeam, Pingui donatus Munere 
(Horace, Epistles II.i.267) 


While you, great patron of mankind, sustain 
The balanc'd world, and open all the main; 
Your country, chief, in arms abroad defend, 
At home, with morals, arts, and laws amend; 
How shall the Muse, from such a monarch steal 
An hour, and not defraud the public weal? 
 
       Edward and Henry, now the boast of fame, 
And virtuous Alfred, a more sacred name, 
After a life of gen'rous toils endur'd, 
The Gaul subdu'd, or property secur'd, 
Ambition humbled, mighty cities storm'd, 
Or laws establish'd, and the world reform'd; 
Clos'd their long glories with a sigh, to find 
Th' unwilling gratitude of base mankind! 
All human virtue, to its latest breath 
Finds envy never conquer'd, but by death. 
The great Alcides, ev'ry labour past, 
Had still this monster to subdue at last. 
Sure fate of all, beneath whose rising ray 
Each star of meaner merit fades away! 
Oppress'd we feel the beam directly beat, 
Those suns of glory please not till they set. 
 
       To thee the world its present homage pays, 
The harvest early, but mature the praise: 
Great friend of liberty! in kings a name 
Above all Greek, above all Roman fame: 
Whose word is truth, as sacred and rever'd, 
As Heav'n's own oracles from altars heard. 
Wonder of kings! like whom, to mortal eyes 
None e'er has risen, and none e'er shall rise. 
 
       Just in one instance, be it yet confest 
Your people, Sir, are partial in the rest: 
Foes to all living worth except your own, 
And advocates for folly dead and gone. 
Authors, like coins, grow dear as they grow old; 
It is the rust we value, not the gold. 
Chaucer's worst ribaldry is learn'd by rote, 
And beastly Skelton heads of houses quote: 
One likes no language but the  Faery Queen ; 
A Scot will fight for Christ's Kirk o' the Green: 
And each true Briton is to Ben so civil, 
He swears the Muses met him at the Devil. 
 
       Though justly Greece her eldest sons admires, 
Why should not we be wiser than our sires? 
In ev'ry public virtue we excel: 
We build, we paint, we sing, we dance as well, 
And learned Athens to our art must stoop, 
Could she behold us tumbling through a hoop. 
 
       If time improve our wit as well as wine, 
Say at what age a poet grows divine? 
Shall we, or shall we not, account him so, 
Who died, perhaps, an hundred years ago? 
End all dispute; and fix the year precise 
When British bards begin t'immortalize? 
 
       ""Who lasts a century can have no flaw, 
I hold that wit a classic, good in law."" 
 
       Suppose he wants a year, will you compound? 
And shall we deem him ancient, right and sound, 
Or damn to all eternity at once, 
At ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce? 
 
       ""We shall not quarrel for a year or two; 
By courtesy of England, he may do."" 
 
       Then by the rule that made the horsetail bare, 
I pluck out year by year, as hair by hair, 
And melt down ancients like a heap of snow: 
While you, to measure merits, look in Stowe, 
And estimating authors by the year, 
Bestow a garland only on a bier. 
 
       Shakespeare (whom you and ev'ry playhouse bill 
Style the divine, the matchless, what you will) 
For gain, not glory, wing'd his roving flight, 
And grew immortal in his own despite. 
Ben, old and poor, as little seem'd to heed 
The life to come, in ev'ry poet's creed. 
Who now reads Cowley? if he pleases yet, 
His moral pleases, not his pointed wit; 
Forgot his epic, nay Pindaric art, 
But still I love the language of his heart. 
 
       ""Yet surely, surely, these were famous men! 
What boy but hears the sayings of old Ben? 
In all debates where critics bear a part, 
Not one but nods, and talks of Jonson's art, 
Of Shakespeare's nature, and of Cowley's wit; 
How Beaumont's judgment check'd what Fletcher writ; 
How Shadwell hasty, Wycherley was slow; 
But, for the passions, Southerne sure and Rowe. 
These, only these, support the crowded stage, 
From eldest Heywood down to Cibber's age."" 
 
       All this may be; the people's voice is odd, 
It is, and it is not, the voice of God. 
To  Gammer Gurton if it give the bays, 
And yet deny the  Careless Husband praise, 
Or say our fathers never broke a rule; 
Why then, I say, the public is a fool. 
But let them own, that greater faults than we 
They had, and greater virtues, I'll agree. 
Spenser himself affects the obsolete, 
And Sidney's verse halts ill on Roman feet: 
Milton's strong pinion now not Heav'n can bound, 
Now serpent-like, in prose he sweeps the ground, 
In quibbles, angel and archangel join, 
And God the Father turns a school divine. 
Not that I'd lop the beauties from his book, 
Like slashing Bentley with his desp'rate hook, 
Or damn all Shakespeare, like th' affected fool 
At court, who hates whate'er he read at school. 
 
       But for the wits of either Charles's days, 
The mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease; 
Sprat, Carew, Sedley, and a hundred more, 
(Like twinkling stars the  Miscellanies o'er) 
One simile, that solitary shines 
In the dry desert of a thousand lines, 
Or lengthen'd thought that gleams through many a page, 
Has sanctified whole poems for an age. 
 
       I lose my patience, and I own it too, 
When works are censur'd, not as bad, but new; 
While if our elders break all reason's laws, 
These fools demand not pardon, but applause. 
 
       On Avon's bank, where flow'rs eternal blow, 
If I but ask if any weed can grow? 
One tragic sentence if I dare deride, 
Which Betterton's grave action dignified, 
Or well-mouth'd Booth with emphasis proclaims 
(Though but, perhaps, a muster-roll of names) 
How will our fathers rise up in a rage, 
And swear, all shame is lost in George's age! 
You'd think no fools disgrac'd the former reign, 
Did not some grave examples yet remain, 
Who scorn a lad should teach his father skill, 
And, having once been wrong, will be so still. 
He, who to seem more deep than you or I, 
Extols old bards, or Merlin's Prophecy, 
Mistake him not; he envies, not admires, 
And to debase the sons, exalts the sires. 
Had ancient times conspir'd to disallow 
What then was new, what had been ancient now? 
Or what remain'd, so worthy to be read 
By learned critics, of the mighty dead? 
 
       In days of ease, when now the weary sword 
Was sheath'd, and luxury with Charles restor'd; 
In ev'ry taste of foreign courts improv'd, 
""All, by the King's example, liv'd and lov'd."" 
Then peers grew proud in horsemanship t'excel, 
Newmarket's glory rose, as Britain's fell; 
The soldier breath'd the gallantries of France, 
And ev'ry flow'ry courtier writ romance. 
Then marble, soften'd into life, grew warm, 
And yielding metal flow'd to human form: 
Lely on animated canvas stole 
The sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul. 
No wonder then, when all was love and sport, 
The willing Muses were debauch'd at court: 
On each enervate string they taught the note 
To pant or tremble through an eunuch's throat. 
But Britain, changeful as a child at play, 
Now calls in princes, and now turns away: 
Now Whig, now Tory, what we lov'd we hate; 
Now all for pleasure, now for Church and state; 
Now for prerogative, and now for laws; 
Effects unhappy! from a noble cause. 
 
       Time was, a sober Englishman would knock 
His servants up, and rise by five o'clock, 
Instruct his family in ev'ry rule, 
And send his wife to church, his son to school. 
To worship like his fathers was his care; 
To teach their frugal virtues to his heir; 
To prove that luxury could never hold, 
And place, on good security, his gold. 
Now times are chang'd, and one poetic itch 
Has seiz'd the court and city, poor and rich: 
Sons, sires, and grandsires, all will wear the bays, 
Our wives read Milton, and our daughters plays, 
To theatres, and to rehearsals throng, 
And all our grace at table is a song. 
I, who so oft renounce the Muses, lie, 
Not {-}{-}{-}{-}{-}'s self e'er tells more fibs than I; 
When sick of Muse, our follies we deplore, 
And promise our best friends to rhyme no more; 
We wake next morning in a raging fit, 
And call for pen and ink to show our wit. 
 
       He serv'd a 'prenticeship who sets up shop; 
Ward tried on puppies and the poor, his drop; 
Ev'n Radcliffe's doctors travel first to France, 
Nor dare to practise till they've learn'd to dance. 
Who builds a bridge that never drove a pile? 
(Should Ripley venture, all the world would smile) 
But those who cannot write, and those who can, 
All rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man. 
 
       Yet, Sir, reflect, the mischief is not great; 
These madmen never hurt the Church or state: 
Sometimes the folly benefits mankind; 
And rarely av'rice taints the tuneful mind. 
Allow him but his plaything of a pen, 
He ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men: 
Flight of cashiers, or mobs, he'll never mind; 
And knows no losses while the Muse is kind. 
To cheat a friend, or ward, he leaves to Peter; 
The good man heaps up nothing but mere metre, 
Enjoys his garden and his book in quiet; 
And then—a perfect hermit in his diet. 
Of little use the man you may suppose, 
Who says in verse what others say in prose: 
Yet let me show, a poet's of some weight, 
And (though no soldier) useful to the state. 
What will a child learn sooner than a song? 
What better teach a foreigner the tongue? 
What's long or short, each accent where to place, 
And speak in public with some sort of grace. 
I scarce can think him such a worthless thing, 
Unless he praise some monster of a king; 
Or virtue or religion turn to sport, 
To please a lewd, or unbelieving court. 
Unhappy Dryden!—In all Charles's days, 
Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays; 
And in our own (excuse some courtly stains) 
No whiter page than Addison remains. 
He, from the taste obscene reclaims our youth, 
And sets the passions on the side of truth, 
Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art, 
And pours each human virtue in the heart. 
Let Ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause, 
Her trade supported, and supplied her laws; 
And leave on Swift this grateful verse engrav'd, 
""The rights a court attack'd, a poet sav'd."" 
Behold the hand that wrought a nation's cure, 
Stretch'd to relieve the idiot and the poor, 
Proud vice to brand, or injur'd worth adorn, 
And stretch the ray to ages yet unborn. 
Not but there are, who merit other palms; 
Hopkins and Sternhold glad the heart with psalms: 
The boys and girls whom charity maintains, 
Implore your help in these pathetic strains: 
How could devotion touch the country pews, 
Unless the gods bestow'd a proper Muse? 
Verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work, 
Verse prays for peace, or sings down Pope and Turk. 
The silenc'd preacher yields to potent strain, 
And feels that grace his pray'r besought in vain; 
The blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng, 
And Heav'n is won by violence of song. 
 
       Our rural ancestors, with little blest, 
Patient of labour when the end was rest, 
Indulg'd the day that hous'd their annual grain, 
With feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain: 
The joy their wives, their sons, and servants share, 
Ease of their toil, and part'ners of their care: 
The laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl, 
Smooth'd ev'ry brow, and open'd ev'ry soul: 
With growing years the pleasing licence grew, 
And taunts alternate innocently flew. 
But times corrupt, and nature, ill-inclin'd, 
Produc'd the point that left a sting behind; 
Till friend with friend, and families at strife, 
Triumphant malice rag'd through private life. 
Who felt the wrong, or fear'd it, took th' alarm, 
Appeal'd to law, and justice lent her arm. 
At length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound, 
The poets learn'd to please, and not to wound: 
Most warp'd to flatt'ry's side; but some, more nice, 
Preserv'd the freedom, and forbore the vice. 
Hence satire rose, that just the medium hit, 
And heals with morals what it hurts with wit. 
 
       We conquer'd France, but felt our captive's charms; 
Her arts victorious triumph'd o'er our arms; 
Britain to soft refinements less a foe, 
Wit grew polite, and numbers learn'd to flow. 
Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join 
The varying verse, the full-resounding line, 
The long majestic march, and energy divine. 
Though still some traces of our rustic vein 
And splayfoot verse remain'd, and will remain. 
Late, very late, correctness grew our care, 
When the tir'd nation breath'd from civil war. 
Exact Racine, and Corneille's noble fire 
Show'd us that France had something to admire. 
Not but the tragic spirit was our own, 
And full in Shakespeare, fair in Otway shone: 
But Otway fail'd to polish or refine, 
And fluent Shakespeare scarce effac'd a line. 
Ev'n copious Dryden wanted, or forgot, 
The last and greatest art, the art to blot. 
 
       Some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire 
The humbler Muse of comedy require. 
But in known images of life, I guess 
The labour greater, as th' indulgence less. 
Observe how seldom ev'n the best succeed: 
Tell me if Congreve's fools are fools indeed? 
What pert, low dialogue has Farqu'ar writ! 
How Van wants grace, who never wanted wit! 
The stage how loosely does Astr{ae}ea tread, 
Who fairly puts all characters to bed! 
And idle Cibber, how he breaks the laws, 
To make poor Pinky eat with vast applause! 
But fill their purse, our poet's work is done, 
Alike to them, by pathos or by pun. 
 
       O you! whom vanity's light bark conveys 
On fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise, 
With what a shifting gale your course you ply, 
For ever sunk too low, or borne too high! 
Who pants for glory finds but short repose, 
A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows. 
Farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play, 
The silly bard grows fat, or falls away. 
 
       There still remains, to mortify a wit, 
The many-headed monster of the pit: 
A senseless, worthless, and unhonour'd crowd; 
Who, to disturb their betters mighty proud, 
Clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke, 
Call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke. 
What dear delight to Britons farce affords! 
Farce once the taste of mobs, but now of lords; 
(For taste, eternal wanderer, now flies 
From heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes.) 
The play stands still; damn action and discourse, 
Back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse; 
Pageants on pageants, in long order drawn, 
Peers, heralds, bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn; 
The champion too! and, to complete the jest, 
Old Edward's armour beams on Cibber's breast. 
With laughter sure Democritus had died, 
Had he beheld an audience gape so wide. 
Let bear or elephant be e'er so white, 
The people, sure, the people are the sight! 
Ah luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar, 
That bear or elephant shall heed thee more; 
While all its throats the gallery extends, 
And all the thunder of the pit ascends! 
Loud as the wolves on Orcas' stormy steep, 
Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep. 
Such is the shout, the long-applauding note, 
At Quin's high plume, or Oldfield's petticoat, 
Or when from Court a birthday suit bestow'd 
Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load. 
Booth enters—hark! the universal peal! 
""But has he spoken?"" Not a syllable. 
""What shook the stage, and made the people stare?"" 
Cato's long wig, flow'r'd gown, and lacquer'd chair. 
 
       Yet lest you think I rally more than teach, 
Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach, 
Let me for once presume t'instruct the times, 
To know the poet from the man of rhymes: 
'Tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains, 
Can make me feel each passion that he feigns; 
Enrage, compose, with more than magic art, 
With pity and with terror tear my heart; 
And snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air, 
To Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where. 
 
       But not this part of the poetic state 
Alone, deserves the favour of the great: 
Think of those authors, Sir, who would rely 
More on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye. 
Or who shall wander where the Muses sing? 
Who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring? 
How shall we fill a library with wit, 
When Merlin's Cave is half unfurnish'd yet? 
 
       My Liege! why writers little claim your thought, 
I guess: and, with their leave, will tell the fault: 
We poets are (upon a poet's word) 
Of all mankind, the creatures most absurd: 
The season, when to come, and when to go, 
To sing, or cease to sing, we never know; 
And if we will recite nine hours in ten, 
You lose your patience, just like other men. 
Then too we hurt ourselves, when to defend 
A single verse, we quarrel with a friend; 
Repeat unask'd; lament, the wit's too fine 
For vulgar eyes, and point out ev'ry line. 
But most, when straining with too weak a wing, 
We needs will write epistles to the king; 
And from the moment we oblige the town, 
Expect a place, or pension from the Crown; 
Or dubb'd historians by express command, 
T'enroll your triumphs o'er the seas and land, 
Be call'd to court to plan some work divine, 
As once for Louis, Boileau and Racine. 
 
       Yet think, great Sir! (so many virtues shown) 
Ah think, what poet best may make them known? 
Or choose at least some minister of grace, 
Fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place. 
 
       Charles, to late times to be transmitted fair, 
Assign'd his figure to Bernini's care; 
And great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed 
To fix him graceful on the bounding steed; 
So well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit: 
But kings in wit may want discerning spirit. 
The hero William, and the martyr Charles, 
One knighted Blackmore, and one pension'd Quarles; 
Which made old Ben, and surly Dennis swear, 
""No Lord's anointed, but a Russian bear."" 
 
       Not with such majesty, such bold relief, 
The forms august, of king, or conqu'ring chief, 
E'er swell'd on marble; as in verse have shin'd 
(In polish'd verse) the manners and the mind. 
Oh! could I mount on the M{ae}onian wing, 
Your arms, your actions, your repose to sing! 
What seas you travers'd! and what fields you fought! 
Your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought! 
How barb'rous rage subsided at your word, 
And nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword! 
How, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep, 
Peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep; 
Till earth's extremes your mediation own, 
And Asia's tyrants tremble at your throne— 
But verse, alas! your Majesty disdains; 
And I'm not us'd to panegyric strains: 
The zeal of fools offends at any time, 
But most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme, 
Besides, a fate attends on all I write, 
That when I aim at praise, they say I bite. 
A vile encomium doubly ridicules: 
There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools; 
If true, a woeful likeness; and if lies, 
""Praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise."" 
Well may he blush, who gives it, or receives; 
And when I flatter, let my dirty leaves 
(Like journals, odes, and such forgotten things 
As Eusden, Philips, Settle, writ of kings) 
Clothe spice, line trunks, or flutt'ring in a row, 
Befringe the rails of Bedlam and Soho.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Epistle', 'Couplet', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44904/imitations-of-horace,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Alexander Pope,1688–1744,Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady,"What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?
'Tis she!—but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well?
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?

     Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
The glorious fault of angels and of gods;
Thence to their images on earth it flows,
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage:
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;
Like eastern kings a lazy state they keep,
And close confin'd to their own palace, sleep.

     From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die)
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.
As into air the purer spirits flow,
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below;
So flew the soul to its congenial place,
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.

     But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death:
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.
Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball,
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall;
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way)
""Lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd,
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield.
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.""

     What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!)
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier.
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public show?
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?
What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow;
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made.

     So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!

     Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays;
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart,
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more!",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44891/elegy-to-the-memory-of-an-unfortunate-lady,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alexander-pope,,1688.0,1744.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1689–1762,The Lover: A Ballad,"At length, by so much importunity press'd,
Take, C——, at once, the inside of my breast;
This stupid indiff'rence so often you blame,
Is not owing to nature, to fear, or to shame:
I am not as cold as a virgin in lead,
Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my head:
I know but too well how time flies along,
That we live but few years, and yet fewer are young.

But I hate to be cheated, and never will buy
Long years of repentance for moments of joy,
Oh! was there a man (but where shall I find
Good sense and good nature so equally join'd?)
Would value his pleasure, contribute to mine;
Not meanly would boast, nor would lewdly design;
Not over severe, yet not stupidly vain,
For I would have the power, tho' not give the pain.

No pedant, yet learned; no rake-helly gay,
Or laughing, because he has nothing to say;
To all my whole sex obliging and free,
Yet never be fond of any but me;
In public preserve the decorum that's just,
And shew in his eyes he is true to his trust;
Then rarely approach, and respectfully bow,
But not fulsomely pert, nor yet foppishly low.

But when the long hours of public are past,
And we meet with champagne and a chicken at last,
May ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear;
Be banish'd afar both discretion and fear!
Forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd,
He may cease to be formal, and I to be proud.
Till lost in the joy, we confess that we live,
And he may be rude, and yet I may forgive.

And that my delight may be solidly fix'd,
Let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd;
In whose tender bosom my soul may confide,
Whose kindness can soothe me, whose counsel can guide.
From such a dear lover as here I describe,
No danger should fright me, no millions should bribe;
But till this astonishing creature I know,
As I long have liv'd chaste, I will keep myself so.

I never will share with the wanton coquette,
Or be caught by a vain affectation of wit.
The toasters and songsters may try all their art,
But never shall enter the pass of my heart.
I loath the lewd rake, the dress'd fopling despise:

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1689–1762,Town Eclogues: Monday; Roxana or the Drawing-Room,"ROXANA from the court retiring late,
Sigh'd her soft sorrows at St. JAMES's gate:
Such heavy thoughts lay brooding in her breast,
Not her own chairmen wth more weight opprest;
They groan the cruel load they're doom'd to bear ;
She in these gentler sounds express'd her care.

"" Was it for this, that I these Roses wear,
"" For this new-set my Jewels for my hair ?
"" Ah ! Princess ! with what zeal have I pursu'd !
"" Almost forgot the duty of a Prude.
"" Thinking I never cou'd attend too soon,
"" I've miss'd my prayers, to get me dress'd by noon.
"" For Thee, ah ! what for Thee did I resign ?
"" My Pleasures, Passions, all that e'er was mine.
"" I sacrific'd both Modesty and Ease,
"" Left Operas, and went to filthy Plays ;
"" Double entendres shock'd my tender ear,
"" Yet even this for Thee I chose to bear.
"" In glowing youth, when nature bids be gay,
"" And ev'ry joy of life before me lay,
"" By honour prompted, and by pride restrain'd,
"" The pleasures of the young my soul disdain'd :
"" Sermons I sought, and with a mien severe
"" Censur'd my neighbours, and said daily pray'r.
"" Alas ! how chang'd! — with the same sermon mien
"" That once I pray'd, the What-d'ye call't I've seen.
"" Ah ! cruel Princess, for thy sake I've lost
"" That reputation which so dear had cost :
"" I, who avoided ev'ry publick place,
"" When bloom, and beauty bid me show my face ;
"" Now near Thee constant ev'ry night abide
"" With never-failing duty by thy side,
"" Myself and daughters standing on a row,
"" To all the foreigners a goodly show !
"" Oft had your drawing-room been sadly thin,
"" And merchants wives close by the chair had been seen ;
"" Had not I amply fill'd the empty space,
"" And sav'd your Highness from the dire disgrace.

"" Yet COQUETILLA's artifice prevails,
"" When all my merit and my duty fails :
"" That COQUETILLA, whose deluding airs
"" Corrupts our virgins, and our youth ensnares ;
"" So sunk her character, so lost her fame,
"" Scarce visited before your Highness came ;
"" Yet for the Bed-chamber 'tis Her you chuse,
"" When Zeal and Fame and Virtue you refuse.
"" Ah ! worthy choice ! not one of all your train
"" Whom censure blasts not, and dishonours stain.
"" Let the nice hind now suckle dirty pigs,
"" And the proud pea-hen snatch the cuckoo's eggs !
"" Let IRIS leave her paint, and own her age,
"" And grave SUFFOLKIA wed a giddy page !
"" A greater miracle is daily view'd,
"" A virtuous Princess with a court so lewd.

"" I know thee, Court ! with all thy treach'rous wiles,
"" Thy false caresses and undoing smiles !
"" Ah ! Princess, learn'd in all the courtly arts
"" To cheat our hopes, and yet to gain our hearts.

"" Large lovely bribes are the great statesman's aim ;
"" And the neglected patriot follows fame.
"" The Prince is ogled ; some the King pursue ;
"" But your ROXANA only follows YOU.
"" Despis'd ROXANA, cease, and try to find
"" Some other, since the Princess proves unkind :
"" Perhaps it is not hard to find at court

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1689–1762,Town Eclogues: Tuesday; St. James's Coffee-House,"SILLIANDER and PATCH. THOU so many favours hast receiv'd,
Wondrous to tell, and hard to be believ'd,
Oh ! H—— D, to my lays attention lend,
Hear how two lovers boastingly contend ;
Like thee successful, such their bloomy youth,
Renown'd alike for gallantry and truth.

St. JAMES's bell had toll'd some wretches in,
(As tatter'd riding-hoods alone could sin)
The happier sinners now their charms put out,
And to their manteaus their complexions suit :
The opera queens had finish'd half their faces,
And city-dames allready taken places ;
Fops of all kinds to see the Lion, run ;
The beauties stay till the first act's begun,
And beaux step home to put fresh linen on.
No well-dress'd youth in coffee-house remain'd,
But pensive PATCH, who on the window lean'd ;
And SILLIANDER, that alert and gay,
First pick'd his teeth, and then began to say.

SILLIANDER. Why all these sighs ? ah ! why so pensive grown ?
Some cause there is that thus you sit alone.
Does hapless passion all this sorrow move ?
Or dost thou envy where the ladies love ?

PATCH. If, whom they love, my envy must pursue,
'Tis sure, at least, I never envy You.

SILLIANDER. No, I'm unhappy, You are in the right,
'Tis You they favour, and 'tis Me they slight.
Yet I could tell, but that I hate to boast,
A club of ladies where 'tis Me they toast.

PATCH. Toasting does seldom any favour prove ;
Like us, they never toast the thing they love.
A certain Duke one night my health begun ;
With chearful pledges round the room it run,
Till the young SILVIA press'd to drink it too,
Started, and vow'd she knew not what to do :
What, drink a fellow's health ! she dy'd with shame :
Yet blush'd whenever she pronounc'd my name.

SILLIANDER. Ill fates pursue me, may I never find
The dice propitious, or the ladies kind,
If fair Miss FLIPPY's fan I did not tear,
And one from me she condescends to wear.

PATCH. Women are always ready to receive ;
'Tis then a favour when the sex will give.
A lady (but she is too great to name)
Beauteous in person, spotless is her fame,
With gentle strugglings let me force this ring ;
Another day may give another thing.

SILLIANDER. I cou'd say something — see this billet-doux —
And as for presents — look upon my shoe —
These buckles were not forc'd, nor half a theft,
But a young Countess fondly made the gift.

PATCH. My Countess is more nice, more artful too,
Affects to fly that I may fierce pursue :
This snuff-box which I begg'd, she still deny'd,
And when I strove to snatch it, seem'd to hide ;
She laugh'd and fled, and as I sought to seize,
With affectation cramm'd it down her stays :
Yet hop'd she did not place it there unseen,
I press'd her breasts, and pull'd it from between.

SILLIANDER. Last night, as I stood ogling of her Grace,
Drinking delicious poison from her face,
The soft enchantress did that face decline,
Nor ever rais'd her eyes to meet with mine ;
With sudden art some secret did pretend,
Lean'd cross two chairs to whisper to a friend,
While the stiff whalebone with the motion rose,
And thousand beauties to my sight expose.

PATCH. Early this morn — (but I was ask'd to come)
I drank bohea in CÆLIA's dressing-room :
Warm from her bed, to me alone within,
Her night-gown fasten'd with a single pin ;
Her night-cloaths tumbled with resistless grace,
And her bright hair play'd careless round her face ;
Reaching the kettle, made her gown unpin,
She wore no waistcoat, and her shift was thin.

SILLIANDER. See TITIANA driving to the park,
Hark ! let us follow, 'tis not yet too dark ;
In her all beauties of the spring are seen,
Her cheeks are rosy, and her mantle green.

PATCH. See, TINTORETTA to the opera goes !
Haste, or the crowd will not permit our bows ;
In her the glory of the heav'ns we view,
Her eyes are star-like, and her mantle blue.

SILLIANDER. What colour does in CÆLIA's stockings shine ?
Reveal that secret, and the prize is thine.

PATCH. What are her garters ! tell me if you can ;
I'll freely own thee for the happier man.

Thus PATCH continued his heroic strain,
While SILLIANDER but contends in vain.

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1689–1762,Town Eclogues: Wednesday; The Tête à Tête,"DANCINDA. "" NO, fair DANCINDA, no ; you strive in vain
"" To calm my care and mitigate my pain ;
"" If all my sighs, my cares, can fail to move,
"" Ah ! sooth me not with fruitless vows of love.""

Thus STREPHON spoke. DANCINDA thus reply'd :
What must I do to gratify your pride ?
Too well you know (ungrateful as thou art)
How much you triumph in this tender heart ;
What proof of love remains for me to grant ?
Yet still you teize me with some new complaint.
Oh ! would to heav'n ! — but the fond wish is vain —
Too many favours had not made it plain !
But such a passion breaks thro' all disguise,
Love reddens on my cheek and wishes in my eyes.
Is't not enough (inhuman and unkind !)
I own the secret conflict of my mind ?
You cannot know what secret pain I prove,
When I with burning blushes own I love.
You see my artless joy at your approach,
I sigh, I faint, I tremble at your touch ;
And in your absence all the world I shun ;
I hate mankind, and curse the cheering sun.
Still as I fly, ten thousand swains pursue ;
Ten thousand swains I sacrifice to you.
I shew you all my heart without disguise :
But these are tender proofs that you despise —
I see too well what wishes you pursue ;
You wou'd not only conquer, but undo :
You, cruel victor, weary of your flame,
Would seek a cure in my eternal shame ;
And not content my honour to subdue,
Now strive to triumph o'er my virtue too.
Oh ! LOVE, a God indeed to womankind,
Whose arrows burn me and whose fetters bind,
Avenge thy altars, vindicate thy fame,
And blast these traytors that profane thy name,
Who by pretending to thy sacred fire,
Raise cursed trophies to impure desire.

Have you forgot with what ensnaring art
You first seduc'd this fond uncautious heart ?
Then as I fled, did you not kneeling cry,
Turn, cruel beauty ; whither wou'd you fly ?
Why all these Doubts ? why this distrustful fear ?
No impious wishes shall offend your ear :
Nor ever shall my boldest hopes pretend
Above the title of a tender friend ;
Blest, if my lovely Goddess will permit
My humble vow, thus sighing at her feet.
The tyrant Love that in my Bosom reigns,
The God himself submits to wear your chains ;
You shall direct his course, his ardour tame,
And check the fury of his wildest flame.

Unpractis'd youth is easily deceiv'd ;
Sooth'd by such sounds, I listen'd and believ'd :
Now quite forgot that soft submissive fear :
You dare to ask what I must blush to hear.

Cou'd I forget the honour of my race,
And meet your wishes, fearless of disgrace ;
Cou'd passion o'er my tender youth prevail,
And all my mother's pious maxims fail ;
Yet to preserve your heart (which still must be,
False as it is, for ever dear to me)
This fatal proof of love I wou'd not give,
Which you contemn the moment you receive.
The wretched she, who yields to guilty joys
A man may pity, but he must despise.
Your ardour ceas'd, I then shou'd see you shun
The wretched victim by your arts undone.
Yet if I cou'd that cold indifference bear,
What more wou'd strike me with the last despair,
With this reflection wou'd my soul be torn,
To know I merited your cruel scorn.

Has Love no pleasures free from guilt or fear ?
Pleasures less fierce, more lasting, more sincere ?
Thus let us gently kiss and fondly gaze,
Love is a child, and like a child it plays.

O STREPHON, if you wou'd continue just,
If Love be something more than brutal lust,
Forbear to ask what I must still deny,
This bitter pleasure, this destructive joy,
So closely follow'd by the dismal train
Of cutting shame, and guilt's heart-piercing pain.

She paus'd ; and fix'd her eyes upon her fan ;
He took a pinch of snuff, and thus began ;
Madam, if Love — but he cou'd say no more,
For Mademoiselle came rapping at the door.

The dangerous moments no adieus afford ;
Begone, she cries, I'm sure I hear my Lord.
The lover starts from his unfinish'd loves,
To snatch his hat, and seek his scatter'd gloves :
The sighing dame to meet her dear prepares,
While STREPHON cursing, slips down the back-stairs.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'First Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Romantic Love', 'Unrequited Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44764/town-eclogues-wednesday-the-tete-a-tete,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lady-mary-wortley-montagu,,1689.0,1762.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,1689–1762,Town Eclogues: Thursday; the Bassette-Table,"CARDELIA. THE bassette-table spread, the tallier come,
Why stays SMILINDA in the dressing-room ?
Rise, pensive nymph ! the tallier stays for you.

SMILINDA. Ah ! Madam, since my SHARPER is untrue,
I joyless make my once ador'd alpieu.
I saw him stand behind OMBRELIA's Chair,
And whisper with that soft deluding air,
And those feign'd sighs that cheat the list'ng fair —

CARDELIA. Is this the cause of your romantic strains ?
A mightier grief my heavy heart sustains.
As you by love, so I by fortune cross'd,
In one bad deal three Septleva's I lost.

SMILINDA. Is that a grief which you compare with mine ?
With ease the smiles of fortune I resign.
Wou'd all my gold in one bad deal were gone,
Were lovely SHARPFR mine, and mine alone.

CARDELIA. A lover lost, is but a common care,
And prudent nymphs against the change prepare.
The queen of Clubs thrice lost ! Oh ! who cou'd guess
This fatal stroke this unforeseen distress !

SMILINDA. See ! BETTY LOVEIT very à propos !
She all the pains of love and play does know,
Deeply experienc'd many years ago.
Dear BETTY shall th' important point decide,
BETTY, who oft the pains of each has try'd :
Impartial, she shall say who suffers most,
By cards, ill-usage, or by lovers lost.

LOVEIT. Tell, tell your griefs ; attentive will I stay,
Tho' time is precious, and I want some tea.

CARDELIA. Behold this equipage by MATHERS wrought
With fifty guineas (a great pen'orth !) bought !
See on the tooth-pick MARS and CUPID strive,
And both the struggling figures seem to liue.
Upon the bottom see the Queen's bright face ;
A myrtle foliage round the thimble case ;
JOVE, JOVE himself does on the scissars shine,
The metal and the workmanship divine.

SMILINDA. This snuff-box once the pledge of SHARPER's love,
When rival beauties for the present strove,
(At CORTICELLI's he the raffle won,
There first his passion was in public shown ;
HAZARDIA blush'd, and turn'd her head aside,
A rival's envy all in vain to hide)
This snuff-box — on the hinge see diamonds shine ;
This snuff-box will I stake, the prize is mine.

CARDELIA. Alas ! far lesser losses than I bear,
Have made a soldier sigh, a lover swear :
But oh ! what makes the disappointment hard,
'Twas my own Lord who drew the fatal card ! —
In complaisance I took the Queen he gave,
Tho' my own secret wish was for the Knave :
The Knave won son ecart that I had chose,
And the next pull my septleva I lose.

SMILINDA. But ah ! what aggravates the killing smart,
The cruel thought that stabs me to the heart,
This curs'd OMBRELIA, this undoing fair,
By whose vile arts this heavy grief I bear,
She, at whose name I shed these spiteful tears,
She owes to me, the very charms she wears :
An aukward thing when first she came to town,
Her shape unfinish'd and her face unknown ;
She was my friend, I taught her first to spread
Upon her sallow cheeks enlivening red,
I introduc'd her to the park and plays,
And by my Interest COSINS made her stays ;
Ungrateful wretch ! with mimick airs grown pert,
She dares to steal my favourite lover's heart.

CARDELIA. Wretch that I was ! how often have I swore,
When WINNALL tallied, I would punt no more !
I know the bite, yet to my ruin run,
And see the folly which I cannot shun.

SMILINDA. How many maids have SHARPER's vows deceiv'd !
How many curs'd the moment they believ'd !
Yet, his known falshood could no warning prove :
Ah ! what are warnings to a maid in love !

CARDELIA. But of what marble must that breast be form'd,
Can gaze on Bassette, and remain unwarm'd ?
When kings, queens, knaves are set in decent rank,
Expos'd in glorious heaps the tempting bank !
Guineas, half-guineas, all the shining train,
The Winner's pleasure and the Loser's pain ;
In bright confusion open rouleaus lie,
They strike the soul, and glitter in the eye ;
Fir'd by the sight, all reason I disdain,
My passions rise, and will not bear the rein :
Look upon Bassette, you who Reason boast,
And see if Reason may not there be lost !

SMILINDA. What more than marble must that breast compose,
That listens coldly to my SHARPER's vows !
Then when he trembles, when his blushes rise,
When awful Love seems melting in his eyes !
With eager beats his Mechlin cravat moves :
He loves, I whisper to myself, He loves !
Such unfeign'd passion in his look appears,
I lose all mem'ry of my former fears ;
My panting heart confesses all his charms ;
I yield at once, and sink into his arms.
Think of that moment, you who Prudence boast !
For such a moment, Prudence well were lost.

CARDELIA. At the Groom-porter's, batter'd bullies play ;
Some Dukes at Marybon bowl time away :
But who the bowl or rattling dice compares
To Bassette's heavenly joys and pleasing cares ?

SMILINDA. Soft SIMPLICETTA doats upon a beau ;
PRUDINA likes a man, and laughs at show :
Their several graces in my SHARPER meet ;
Strong as the footman, as the master sweet.

LOVEIT. Cease your contention, which has been too long,
I grow impatient, and the tea too strong :
Attend, and yield to what I now decide ;
The equipage shall grace SMILINDA's side ;
The snuff-box to CARDELIA I decree ;
So leave complaining, and begin your tea.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44765/town-eclogues-thursday-the-bassette-table,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lady-mary-wortley-montagu,,1689.0,1762.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

' The Gamester has for me his dun delay'd,
' And overseen the card, I would have play'd.
' The bold and haughty by success made vain,
' Aw'd by my eyes has trembled to complain:
' The bashful 'squire touch'd by a wish unknown,
' Has dar'd to speak with spirit not his own ;
' Fir'd by one wish, all did alike adore ;
' Now beauty's fled, and lovers are no more!

' As round the room I turn my weeping eyes,
' New unaffected scenes of sorrow rise !
' Far from my sight that killing picture bear,
' The face disfigure, and the canvas tear !
' That picture which with pride I us'd to show,
' The lost resemblance but upbraids me now.
' And thou, my toilette! where I oft have sat,
' While hours unheeded pass'd in deep debate,
' How curls should fall, or where a patch to place :
' If blue or scarlet best became my face;
' Now on some happier nymph thy aid bestow ;
' On fairer heads, ye useless jewels glow !
' No borrow'd lustre can my charms restore ;
' Beauty is fled, and dress is now no more !

' Ye meaner beauties, I permit ye shine ;
' Go, triumph in the hearts that once were mine ;
' But midst your triumphs with confusion know,
' 'Tis to my ruin all your arms ye owe.
' Would pitying Heav'n restore my wonted mien,
' Ye still might move unthought-of and unseen.
' But oh ! how vain, how wretched is the boast
' Of beauty faded, and of empire lost !
' What now is left but weeping, to deplore
' My beauty fled, and empire now no more !

' Ye, cruel Chymists, what with-held your aid !
' Could no pomatums save a trembling maid ?
' How false and trifling is that art you boast ;
' No art can give me back my beauty lost.
' In tears, surrounded by my friends I lay,
' Mask'd o'er and trembled at the sight of day;
' MIRMILLO came my fortune to deplore,

Samuel Johnson,1709–1784,"Drury-lane Prologue Spoken by Mr. Garrick at the Opening of the Theatre in Drury-Lane, 1747","When Learning’s triumph o’er her barb’rous foes 
First rear’d the stage, immortal Shakespear rose; 
Each change of many-colour’d life he drew, 
Exhausted worlds, and then imagin’d new: 
Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign, 
And panting Time toil’d after him in vain: 
His pow’rful strokes presiding Truth impress’d, 
And unresisted Passion storm’d the breast. 
 
         Then Jonson came, instructed from the school, 
To please in method, and invent by rule; 
His studious patience, and laborious art, 
By regular approach essay’d the heart; 
Cold Approbation gave the ling’ring bays, 
For those who durst not censure, scarce could praise. 
A mortal born he met the general doom, 
But left, like Egypt’s kings, a lasting tomb. 
 
         The Wits of Charles found easier ways to fame, 
Nor wish’d for Jonson’s art, or Shakespear’s flame, 
Themselves they studied, as they felt, they writ, 
Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit. 
Vice always found a sympathetic friend; 
They pleas’d their age, and did not aim to mend. 
Yet bards like these aspir’d to lasting praise, 
And proudly hop’d to pimp in future days. 
Their cause was gen’ral, their supports were strong, 
Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long; 
Till Shame regain’d the post that Sense betray’d, 
And Virtue call’d Oblivion to her aid. 
 
         Then crush’d by rules, and weaken’d as refin’d, 
For years the pow’r of tragedy declin’d; 
From bard, to bard, the frigid caution crept, 
Till Declamation roar’d, while Passion slept. 
Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread, 
Philosophy remain’d, though Nature fled. 
But forc’d at length her ancient reign to quit, 
She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit: 
Exulting Folly hail’d the joyful day, 
And pantomime, and song, confirm’d her sway. 
 
         But who the coming changes can presage, 
And mark the future periods of the stage?— 
Perhaps if skill could distant times explore, 
New Behns, new Durfoys, yet remain in store. 
Perhaps, where Lear has rav’d, and Hamlet died, 
On flying cars new sorcerers may ride. 
Perhaps, for who can guess th’ effects of chance? 
Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance. 
 
         Hard is his lot, that here by Fortune plac’d, 
Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste; 
With ev’ry meteor of caprice must play, 
And chase the new-blown bubbles of the day. 
Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice, 
The stage but echoes back the public voice. 
The drama’s laws the drama’s patrons give, 
For we that live to please, must please to live. 
 
         Then prompt no more the follies you decry, 
As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die; 
’Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence 
Of rescu’d Nature, and reviving Sense; 
To chase the charms of Sound, the pomp of Show, 
For useful Mirth, and salutary Woe; 
Bid scenic Virtue form the rising age, 
And Truth diffuse her radiance from the stage.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Theater & Dance', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44447/drury-lane-prologue-spoken-by-mr-garrick-at-the-opening-of-the-theatre-in-drury-lane-1747,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/samuel-johnson,,1709.0,1784.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Samuel Johnson,1709–1784,from The Vanity of Human Wishes,"The Tenth Satire of Juvenal, Imitated

Let observation with extensive view,
Survey mankind, from China to Peru;
Remark each anxious toil, each eager strife,
And watch the busy scenes of crowded life;
Then say how hope and fear, desire and hate,
O’erspread with snares the clouded maze of fate,
Where wav’ring man, betray’d by vent’rous pride
To tread the dreary paths without a guide,
As treach’rous phantoms in the mist delude,
Shuns fancied ills, or chases airy good.
How rarely reason guides the stubborn choice,
Rules the bold hand, or prompts the suppliant voice,
How nations sink, by darling schemes oppress’d,
When vengeance listens to the fool’s request.
Fate wings with ev’ry wish th’ afflictive dart,
Each gift of nature, and each grace of art,
With fatal heat impetuous courage glows,
With fatal sweetness elocution flows,
Impeachment stops the speaker’s pow’rful breath,
And restless fire precipitates on death.

    But scarce observ’d the knowing and the bold,
Fall in the gen’ral massacre of gold;
Wide-wasting pest! that rages unconfin’d,
And crowds with crimes the records of mankind,
For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws,
For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws;
Wealth heap’d on wealth, nor truth nor safety buys,
The dangers gather as the treasures rise.

    Let hist’ry tell where rival kings command,
And dubious title shakes the madded land,
When statutes glean the refuse of the sword,
How much more safe the vassal than the lord,
Low sculks the hind beneath the rage of pow’r,
And leaves the wealthy traitor in the Tow’r,
Untouch’d his cottage, and his slumbers sound,
Tho’ confiscation’s vultures hover round.

    The needy traveller, serene and gay,
Walks the wild heath, and sings his toil away.
Does envy seize thee? crush th’ upbraiding joy,
Increase his riches and his peace destroy,
New fears in dire vicissitude invade,
The rustling brake alarms, and quiv’ring shade,
Nor light nor darkness bring his pain relief.
One shews the plunder, and one hides the thief.

    Yet still one gen’ral cry the skies assails,
And gain and grandeur load the tainted gales,
Few know the toiling statesman’s fear or care,
Th’ insidious rival and the gaping heir.

    Once more, Democritus, arise on earth,
With cheerful wisdom and instructive mirth,
See motley life in modern trappings dress’d,
And feed with varied fools th’ eternal jest:
Thou who couldst laugh where want enchain’d caprice,
Toil crush’d conceit, and man was of a piece;
Where wealth unlov’d without a mourner died;
And scarce a sycophant was fed by pride;
Where ne’er was known the form of mock debate,
Or seen a new-made mayor’s unwieldy state;
Where change of fav’rites made no change of laws,
And senates heard before they judg’d a cause;
How wouldst thou shake at Britain’s modish tribe,
Dart the quick taunt, and edge the piercing gibe?
Attentive truth and nature to decry,
And pierce each scene with philosophic eye.
To thee were solemn toys or empty show,
The robes of pleasure and the veils of woe:
All aid the farce, and all thy mirth maintain,
Whose joys are causeless, or whose griefs are vain.

    Such was the scorn that fill’d the sage’s mind,
Renew’d at ev’ry glance on humankind;
How just that scorn ere yet thy voice declare,
Search every state, and canvas ev’ry pray’r.

    Unnumber’d suppliants crowd Preferment’s gate,
Athirst for wealth, and burning to be great;
Delusive Fortune hears th’ incessant call,
They mount, they shine, evaporate, and fall.
On ev’ry stage the foes of peace attend,
Hate dogs their flight, and insult mocks their end.
Love ends with hope, the sinking statesman’s door
Pours in the morning worshiper no more;
For growing names the weekly scribbler lies,
To growing wealth the dedicator flies,
From every room descends the painted face,
That hung the bright Palladium of the place,
And smok’d in kitchens, or in auctions sold,
To better features yields the frame of gold;
For now no more we trace in ev’ry line
Heroic worth, benevolence divine:
The form distorted justifies the fall,
And detestation rids th’ indignant wall.

    ...

    When first the college rolls receive his name,
The young enthusiast quits his ease for fame;
Through all his veins the fever of renown
Spreads from the strong contagion of the gown;
O’er Bodley’s dome his future labours spread,
And Bacon’s mansion trembles o’er his head.
Are these thy views? proceed, illustrious youth,
And virtue guard thee to the throne of Truth!
Yet should thy soul indulge the gen’rous heat,
Till captive Science yields her last retreat;
Should Reason guide thee with her brightest ray,
And pour on misty Doubt resistless day;
Should no false Kindness lure to loose delight,
Nor Praise relax, nor Difficulty fright;
Should tempting Novelty thy cell refrain,
And Sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain;
Should Beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart,
Nor claim the triumph of a letter’d heart;
Should no disease thy torpid veins invade,
Nor Melancholy’s phantoms haunt thy shade;
Yet hope not life from grief or danger free,
Nor think the doom of man revers’d for thee:
Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,
And pause awhile from letters, to be wise;
There mark what ills the scholar’s life assail,
Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail.
See nations slowly wise, and meanly just,
To buried merit raise the tardy bust.
If dreams yet flatter, once again attend,
Hear Lydiat’s life, and Galileo’s end.

    Nor deem, when learning her last prize bestows
The glitt’ring eminence exempt from foes;
See when the vulgar ‘scape, despis’d or aw’d,
Rebellion’s vengeful talons seize on Laud.
From meaner minds, tho’ smaller fines content
The plunder’d palace or sequester’d rent;
Mark’d out by dangerous parts he meets the shock,
And fatal Learning leads him to the block:
Around his tomb let Art and Genius weep,
But hear his death, ye blockheads, hear and sleep.

     ...

    Enlarge my life with multitude of days,
In health, in sickness, thus the suppliant prays;
Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know,
That life protracted is protracted woe.
Time hovers o’er, impatient to destroy,
And shuts up all the passages of joy:
In vain their gifts the bounteous seasons pour,
The fruit autumnal, and the vernal flow’r,
With listless eyes the dotard views the store,
He views, and wonders that they please no more;
Now pall the tasteless meats, and joyless wines,
And Luxury with sighs her slave resigns.
Approach, ye minstrels, try the soothing strain,
And yield the tuneful lenitives of pain:
No sounds alas would touch th’ impervious ear,
Though dancing mountains witness’d Orpheus near;
Nor lute nor lyre his feeble pow’rs attend,
Nor sweeter music of a virtuous friend,
But everlasting dictates crowd his tongue,
Perversely grave, or positively wrong.
The still returning tale, and ling’ring jest,
Perplex the fawning niece and pamper’d guest,
While growing hopes scarce awe the gath’ring sneer,
And scarce a legacy can bribe to hear;
The watchful guests still hint the last offence,
The daughter’s petulance, the son’s expense,
Improve his heady rage with treach’rous skill,
And mould his passions till they make his will.

    Unnumber’d maladies his joints invade,
Lay siege to life and press the dire blockade;
But unextinguish’d Av’rice still remains,
And dreaded losses aggravate his pains;
He turns, with anxious heart and crippled hands,
His bonds of debt, and mortgages of lands;
Or views his coffers with suspicious eyes,
Unlocks his gold, and counts it till he dies.

    But grant, the virtues of a temp’rate prime
Bless with an age exempt from scorn or crime;
An age that melts in unperceiv’d decay,
And glides in modest innocence away;
Whose peaceful day Benevolence endears,
Whose night congratulating Conscience cheers;
The gen’ral fav’rite as the gen’ral friend:
Such age there is, and who could wish its end?

    Yet ev’n on this her load Misfortune flings,
To press the weary minutes’ flagging wings:
New sorrow rises as the day returns,
A sister sickens, or a daughter mourns.
Now kindred Merit fills the sable bier,
Now lacerated Friendship claims a tear.
Year chases year, decay pursues decay,
Still drops some joy from with’ring life away;
New forms arise, and diff’rent views engage,
Superfluous lags the vet’ran on the stage,
Till pitying Nature signs the last release,
And bids afflicted worth retire to peace.

    But few there are whom hours like these await,
Who set unclouded in the gulfs of fate.
From Lydia’s monarch should the search descend,
By Solon caution’d to regard his end,
In life’s last scene what prodigies surprise,
Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise?
From Marlb’rough’s eyes the streams of dotage flow,
And Swift expires a driv’ler and a show.

    The teeming mother, anxious for her race,
Begs for each birth the fortune of a face:
Yet Vane could tell what ills from beauty spring;
And Sedley curs’d the form that pleas’d a king.
Ye nymphs of rosy lips and radiant eyes,
Whom Pleasure keeps too busy to be wise,
Whom Joys with soft varieties invite,
By day the frolic, and the dance by night,
Who frown with vanity, who smile with art,
And ask the latest fashion of the heart,
What care, what rules your heedless charms shall save,
Each nymph your rival, and each youth your slave?
Against your fame with fondness hate combines,
The rival batters and the lover mines.
With distant voice neglected Virtue calls,
Less heard and less, the faint remonstrance falls;
Tir’d with contempt, she quits the slipp’ry reign,
And Pride and Prudence take her seat in vain.
In crowd at once, where none the pass defend,
The harmless freedom, and the private friend.
The guardians yield, by force superior plied;
By Int’rest, Prudence; and by Flatt’ry, Pride.
Now Beauty falls betray’d, despis’d, distress’d,
And hissing Infamy proclaims the rest.

    Where then shall Hope and Fear their objects find?
Must dull Suspense corrupt the stagnant mind?
Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate,
Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate?
Must no dislike alarm, no wishes rise,
No cries attempt the mercies of the skies?
Enquirer, cease, petitions yet remain,
Which Heav’n may hear, nor deem religion vain.
Still raise for good the supplicating voice,
But leave to Heav’n the measure and the choice.
Safe in his pow’r, whose eyes discern afar
The secret ambush of a specious pray’r.
Implore his aid, in his decisions rest,
Secure whate’er he gives, he gives the best.
Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires,
And strong devotion to the skies aspires,
Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind,
Obedient passions, and a will resign’d;
For love, which scarce collective man can fill;
For patience, sov’reign o’er transmuted ill;
For faith, that panting for a happier seat,
Counts death kind Nature’s signal of retreat:
These goods for man the laws of Heav’n ordain,
These goods he grants, who grants the pow’r to gain;
With these celestial wisdom calms the mind,
And makes the happiness she does not find.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Couplet', 'Allusion']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44448/the-vanity-of-human-wishes,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/samuel-johnson,,1709.0,1784.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Thomas Gray,1716–1771,Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College,"Ye distant spires, ye antique tow'rs, 
         That crown the wat'ry glade, 
Where grateful Science still adores 
         Her Henry's holy Shade; 
And ye, that from the stately brow 
Of Windsor's heights th' expanse below 
         Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey, 
Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowr's among 
Wanders the hoary Thames along 
         His silver-winding way. 
 
Ah, happy hills, ah, pleasing shade, 
         Ah, fields belov'd in vain, 
Where once my careless childhood stray'd, 
         A stranger yet to pain! 
I feel the gales, that from ye blow, 
A momentary bliss bestow, 
         As waving fresh their gladsome wing, 
My weary soul they seem to soothe, 
And, redolent of joy and youth, 
         To breathe a second spring. 
 
Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen 
         Full many a sprightly race 
Disporting on thy margent green 
         The paths of pleasure trace, 
Who foremost now delight to cleave 
With pliant arm thy glassy wave? 
         The captive linnet which enthrall? 
What idle progeny succeed 
To chase the rolling circle's speed, 
         Or urge the flying ball? 
 
While some on earnest business bent 
         Their murm'ring labours ply 
'Gainst graver hours, that bring constraint 
         To sweeten liberty: 
Some bold adventurers disdain 
The limits of their little reign, 
         And unknown regions dare descry: 
Still as they run they look behind, 
They hear a voice in ev'ry wind, 
         And snatch a fearful joy. 
 
Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed, 
         Less pleasing when possest; 
The tear forgot as soon as shed, 
         The sunshine of the breast: 
Theirs buxom health of rosy hue, 
Wild wit, invention ever-new, 
         And lively cheer of vigour born; 
The thoughtless day, the easy night, 
The spirits pure, the slumbers light, 
         That fly th' approach of morn. 
 
Alas, regardless of their doom, 
         The little victims play! 
No sense have they of ills to come, 
         Nor care beyond to-day: 
Yet see how all around 'em wait 
The ministers of human fate, 
         And black Misfortune's baleful train! 
Ah, show them where in ambush stand 
To seize their prey the murth'rous band! 
         Ah, tell them they are men! 
 
These shall the fury Passions tear, 
         The vultures of the mind 
Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear, 
         And Shame that skulks behind; 
Or pining Love shall waste their youth, 
Or Jealousy with rankling tooth, 
         That inly gnaws the secret heart, 
And Envy wan, and faded Care, 
Grim-visag'd comfortless Despair, 
         And Sorrow's piercing dart. 
 
Ambition this shall tempt to rise, 
         Then whirl the wretch from high, 
To bitter Scorn a sacrifice, 
         And grinning Infamy. 
The stings of Falsehood those shall try, 
And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye, 
         That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow; 
And keen Remorse with blood defil'd, 
And moody Madness laughing wild 
         Amid severest woe. 
 
Lo, in the vale of years beneath 
         A griesly troop are seen, 
The painful family of Death, 
         More hideous than their Queen: 
This racks the joints, this fires the veins, 
That ev'ry labouring sinew strains, 
         Those in the deeper vitals rage: 
Lo, Poverty, to fill the band, 
That numbs the soul with icy hand, 
         And slow-consuming Age. 
 
To each his suff'rings: all are men, 
         Condemn'd alike to groan, 
The tender for another's pain; 
         Th' unfeeling for his own. 
Yet ah! why should they know their fate?

     Fair Venus' train appear,
Disclose the long-expecting flowers,
     And wake the purple year!
The Attic warbler pours her throat,
Responsive to the cuckoo's note,
     The untaught harmony of spring:
While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly,
Cool zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky
     Their gather'd fragrance fling.

Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch
     A broader, browner shade;
Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech
     O'er-canopies the glade,
Beside some water's rushy brink
With me the Muse shall sit, and think
     (At ease reclin'd in rustic state)
How vain the ardour of the crowd,
How low, how little are the proud,
     How indigent the great!

Still is the toiling hand of Care:
     The panting herds repose:
Yet hark, how thro' the peopled air
     The busy murmur glows!
The insect youth are on the wing,
Eager to taste the honied spring,
     And float amid the liquid noon:
Some lightly o'er the current skim,
Some show their gaily-gilded trim
     Quick-glancing to the sun.

To Contemplation's sober eye
     Such is the race of man:
And they that creep, and they that fly,
     Shall end where they began.
Alike the busy and the gay
But flutter thro' life's little day,
     In fortune's varying colours drest:
Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,
Or chill'd by age, their airy dance
     They leave, in dust to rest.

Methinks I hear in accents low
     The sportive kind reply:
Poor moralist! and what art thou?
     A solitary fly!
Thy joys no glitt'ring female meets,
No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,
     No painted plumage to display:

Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;
They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.

Waves in the eye of Heav'n her many-colour'd wings.

Thomas Gray,1716–1771,The Progress of Poesy: A Pindaric Ode,"I.1. 
         Awake, Æolian lyre, awake, 
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings. 
From Helicon's harmonious springs 
A thousand rills their mazy progress take: 
The laughing flowers, that round them blow, 
Drink life and fragrance as they flow. 
Now the rich stream of music winds along 
Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong, 
Thro' verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign: 
Now rolling down the steep amain, 
Headlong, impetuous, see it pour: 
The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar. 
 
I.2. 
         Oh! Sovereign of the willing soul, 
Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, 
Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares 
And frantic Passions hear thy soft control. 
On Thracia's hills the Lord of War, 
Has curb'd the fury of his car, 
And dropp'd his thirsty lance at thy command. 
Perching on the sceptred hand 
Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king 
With ruffled plumes and flagging wing: 
Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie 
The terror of his beak, and light'nings of his eye. 
 
I.3. 
         Thee the voice, the dance, obey, 
Temper'd to thy warbled lay. 
O'er Idalia's velvet-green 
The rosy-crowned Loves are seen 
On Cytherea's day 
With antic Sports and blue-ey'd Pleasures, 
Frisking light in frolic measures; 
Now pursuing, now retreating, 
Now in circling troops they meet: 
To brisk notes in cadence beating 
Glance their many-twinkling feet. 
Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare: 
Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay. 
With arms sublime, that float upon the air, 
In gliding state she wins her easy way: 
O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move 
The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love. 
 
II.1. 
         Man's feeble race what ills await, 
Labour, and Penury, the racks of Pain, 
Disease, and Sorrow's weeping train, 
And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate! 
The fond complaint, my song, disprove, 
And justify the laws of Jove. 
Say, has he giv'n in vain the heav'nly Muse? 
Night, and all her sickly dews, 
Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry, 
He gives to range the dreary sky: 
Till down the eastern cliffs afar 
Hyperion's march they spy, and glitt'ring shafts of war. 
 
II.2. 
         In climes beyond the solar road, 
Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam, 
The Muse has broke the twilight-gloom 
To cheer the shiv'ring native's dull abode. 
And oft, beneath the od'rous shade 
Of Chili's boundless forests laid, 
She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat 
In loose numbers wildly sweet 
Their feather-cinctur'd chiefs, and dusky loves. 
Her track, where'er the goddess roves, 
Glory pursue, and generous Shame, 
Th' unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame. 
 
II.3. 
         Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep, 
Isles, that crown th' Ægean deep, 
Fields, that cool Ilissus laves, 
Or where Mæander's amber waves 
In ling'ring Lab'rinths creep, 
How do your tuneful echoes languish, 
Mute, but to the voice of Anguish? 
Where each old poetic mountain 
Inspiration breath'd around: 
Ev'ry shade and hallow'd Fountain 
Murmur'd deep a solemn sound: 
Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour 
Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains. 
Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant Power, 
And coward Vice, that revels in her chains. 
When Latium had her lofty spirit lost, 
They sought, O Albion! next thy sea-encircled coast. 
 
III.1. 
         Far from the sun and summer-gale, 
In thy green lap was Nature's darling laid, 
What time, where lucid Avon stray'd, 
To him the mighty Mother did unveil 
Her awful face: the dauntless child 
Stretch'd forth his little arms, and smiled. 
This pencil take (she said) whose colours clear 
Richly paint the vernal year: 
Thine too these golden keys, immortal boy! 
This can unlock the gates of Joy; 
Of Horror that, and thrilling Fears, 
Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears. 
 
III.2. 
         Nor second he, that rode sublime 
Upon the seraph-wings of Ecstasy, 
The secrets of th' Abyss to spy. 
He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time: 
The living throne, the sapphire-blaze, 
Where angels tremble, while they gaze, 
He saw; but blasted with excess of light, 
Clos'd his eyes in endless night. 
Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car, 
Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear 
Two coursers of ethereal race, 
With necks in thunder cloth'd, and long-resounding pace. 
 
III.3. 
         Hark, his hands thy lyre explore! 
Bright-eyed Fancy hovering o'er 
Scatters from her pictur'd urn 
Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn. 
But ah! 'tis heard no more— 
O lyre divine, what daring spirit 
Wakes thee now? tho' he inherit 
Nor the pride, nor ample pinion, 
That the Theban Eagle bear, 
Sailing with supreme dominion 
Thro' the azure deep of air: 
Yet oft before his infant eyes would run 
Such forms, as glitter in the Muse's ray 
With orient hues, unborrow'd of the Sun: 
Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way 
Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate, 
Beneath the good how far—but far above the great.",ode,types/modes,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Ode', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44306/the-progress-of-poesy-a-pindaric-ode,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/thomas-gray,,1716.0,1771.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Thomas Gray,1716–1771,The Fatal Sisters:  An Ode,"(FROM THE NORSE TONGUE)

Now the storm begins to lower,
(Haste, the loom of Hell prepare.)
Iron-sleet of arrowy shower
Hurtles in the darken'd air.

Glitt'ring lances are the loom,
Where the dusky warp we strain,
Weaving many a soldier's doom,
Orkney's woe, and Randver's bane.

See the grisly texture grow,
('Tis of human entrails made,)
And the weights, that play below,
Each a gasping warrior's head.

Shafts for shuttles, dipt in gore,
Shoot the trembling cords along.
Sword, that once a monarch bore,
Keep the tissue close and strong.

Mista black, terrific maid,
Sangrida, and Hilda see,
Join the wayward work to aid:
Tis the woof of victory.

Ere the ruddy sun be set,
Pikes must shiver, javelins sing,
Blade with clatt'ring buckler meet,
Hauberk crash, and helmet ring.

(Weave the crimson web of war)
Let us go, and let us fly,
Where our friends the conflict share,
Where they triumph, where they die.

As the paths of fate we tread,
Wading thro' th' ensanguin'd field:
Gondula, and Geira, spread
O'er the youthful king your shield.

We the reins to slaughter give,
Ours to kill, and ours to spare:
Spite of danger he shall live.
(Weave the crimson web of war.)

They, whom once the desert-beach
Pent within its bleak domain,
Soon their ample sway shall stretch
O'er the plenty of the plain.

Low the dauntless earl is laid
Gor'd with many a gaping wound:
Fate demands a nobler head;
Soon a king shall bite the ground.

Long his loss shall Erin weep,
Ne'er again his likeness see;
Long her strains in sorrow steep,
Strains of immortality.

Horror covers all the heath,
Clouds of carnage blot the sun.
Sisters, weave the web of death;
Sisters, cease, the work is done.

Hail the task, and hail the hands!
Songs of joy and triumph sing!
Joy to the victorious bands;
Triumph to the younger king.

Mortal, thou that hear'st the tale,
Learn the tenor of our song.
Scotland thro' each winding vale
 Far and wide the notes prolong.

Sisters, hence with spurs of speed:
Each her thund'ring falchion wield;
Each bestride her sable steed.

Thomas Gray,1716–1771,Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes,"’Twas on a lofty vase’s side,
Where China’s gayest art had dyed
 The azure flowers that blow;
Demurest of the tabby kind,
The pensive Selima, reclined,
 Gazed on the lake below.

Her conscious tail her joy declared;
The fair round face, the snowy beard,
 The velvet of her paws,
Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,
Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,
 She saw; and purred applause.

Still had she gazed; but ’midst the tide
Two angel forms were seen to glide,
 The genii of the stream;
Their scaly armour’s Tyrian hue
Through richest purple to the view
 Betrayed a golden gleam.

The hapless nymph with wonder saw;
A whisker first and then a claw,
 With many an ardent wish,
She stretched in vain to reach the prize.
What female heart can gold despise?
 What cat’s averse to fish?

Presumptuous maid! with looks intent
Again she stretch’d, again she bent,
 Nor knew the gulf between.
(Malignant Fate sat by, and smiled)
The slippery verge her feet beguiled,
 She tumbled headlong in.
Eight times emerging from the flood
She mewed to every watery god,
 Some speedy aid to send.
No dolphin came, no Nereid stirred;
Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard;
 A Favourite has no friend!

From hence, ye beauties, undeceived,
Know, one false step is ne’er retrieved,
 And be with caution bold.
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize;
 Nor all that glisters, gold.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Relationships', 'Pets', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Elegy']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44302/ode-on-the-death-of-a-favourite-cat-drowned-in-a-tub-of-goldfishes,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/thomas-gray,,1716.0,1771.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

These ears, alas! for other notes repine,

Christopher Smart,1722–1771,from Jubilate Agno,"For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.
For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.
For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.
For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.
For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.
For he rolls upon prank to work it in.
For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.
For this he performs in ten degrees.
For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.
For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.
For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.
For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.
For fifthly he washes himself.
For sixthly he rolls upon wash.
For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.
For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.
For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.
For tenthly he goes in quest of food.
For having consider'd God and himself he will consider his neighbour.
For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.
For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.
For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.
For when his day's work is done his business more properly begins.
For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary.
For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.
For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.
For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.
For he is of the tribe of Tiger.
For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.
For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.
For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.
For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he's a good Cat.
For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.
For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.
For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.
For every family had one cat at least in the bag.
For the English Cats are the best in Europe.
For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.
For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.
For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.
For he is tenacious of his point.
For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.
For he knows that God is his Saviour.
For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.
For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.
For he is of the Lord's poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.
For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.
For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.
For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.
For he is docile and can learn certain things.
For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.
For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.
For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.
For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.
For he can jump from an eminence into his master's bosom.
For he can catch the cork and toss it again.
For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.
For the former is afraid of detection.
For the latter refuses the charge.
For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.
For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.
For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.
For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.
For his ears are so acute that they sting again.
For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.
For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.
For I perceived God's light about him both wax and fire.
For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.
For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.
For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.
For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.
For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.
For he can swim for life.
For he can creep.",free verse,meters,"['Relationships', 'Pets', 'Religion', 'God & the Divine', 'Techniques', 'Free Verse', 'Anaphora']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45173/jubilate-agno,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/christopher-smart,,1722.0,1771.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

    Nor swifter greyhound follow, 
Whose foot ne’er tainted morning dew, 
    Nor ear heard huntsman’s hallo’, 
 
Old Tiney, surliest of his kind, 
    Who, nursed with tender care, 
And to domesticate bounds confined, 
    Was still a wild jack-hare. 
 
Though duly from my hand he took 
    His pittance every night, 
He did it with a jealous look, 
    And, when he could, would bite. 
 
His diet was of wheaten bread, 
    And milk, and oats, and straw, 
Thistles, or lettuces instead, 
    With sand to scour his maw. 
 
On twigs of hawthorn he regaled, 
    On pippins’ russet peel; 
And, when his juicy salads failed, 
    Sliced carrot pleased him well. 
 
A Turkey carpet was his lawn, 
    Whereon he loved to bound, 
To skip and gambol like a fawn, 
    And swing his rump around. 
 
His frisking was at evening hours, 
    For then he lost his fear; 
But most before approaching showers, 
    Or when a storm drew near. 
 
Eight years and five round-rolling moons 
    He thus saw steal away, 
Dozing out all his idle noons, 
    And every night at play. 
 
I kept him for his humor’s sake, 
    For he would oft beguile 
My heart of thoughts that made it ache, 
    And force me to a smile. 
 
But now, beneath this walnut-shade 
    He finds his long, last home, 
And waits in snug concealment laid, 
    Till gentler Puss shall come. 
 
He, still more agèd, feels the shocks 
    From which no care can save,

William Cowper,1731–1800,On Receipt Of My Mother's Picture,"Oh that those lips had language! Life has pass'd
With me but roughly since I heard thee last.
Those lips are thine—thy own sweet smiles I see,
The same that oft in childhood solaced me;
Voice only fails, else, how distinct they say,
""Grieve not, my child, chase all thy fears away!""
The meek intelligence of those dear eyes
(Blest be the art that can immortalize,
The art that baffles time's tyrannic claim
To quench it) here shines on me still the same.

    Faithful remembrancer of one so dear,
Oh welcome guest, though unexpected, here!
Who bidd'st me honour with an artless song,
Affectionate, a mother lost so long,
I will obey, not willingly alone,
But gladly, as the precept were her own;
And, while that face renews my filial grief,
Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief—
Shall steep me in Elysian reverie,
A momentary dream, that thou art she.

    My mother! when I learn'd that thou wast dead,
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
Hover'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,
Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?
Perhaps thou gav'st me, though unseen, a kiss;
Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss—
Ah that maternal smile! it answers—Yes.
I heard the bell toll'd on thy burial day,
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,
And, turning from my nurs'ry window, drew
A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!
But was it such?—It was.—Where thou art gone
Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.
May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,
The parting sound shall pass my lips no more!
Thy maidens griev'd themselves at my concern,
Oft gave me promise of a quick return.
What ardently I wish'd, I long believ'd,
And, disappointed still, was still deceiv'd;
By disappointment every day beguil'd,
Dupe of to-morrow even from a child.
Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,
Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent,
I learn'd at last submission to my lot;
But, though I less deplor'd thee, ne'er forgot.

    Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more,
Children not thine have trod my nurs'ry floor;
And where the gard'ner Robin, day by day,
Drew me to school along the public way,
Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapt
In scarlet mantle warm, and velvet capt,
'Tis now become a history little known,
That once we call'd the past'ral house our own.
Short-liv'd possession! but the record fair
That mem'ry keeps of all thy kindness there,
Still outlives many a storm that has effac'd
A thousand other themes less deeply trac'd.
Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,
That thou might'st know me safe and warmly laid;
Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,
The biscuit, or confectionary plum;
The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestow'd
By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glow'd;
All this, and more endearing still than all,
Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall,
Ne'er roughen'd by those cataracts and brakes
That humour interpos'd too often makes;
All this still legible in mem'ry's page,
And still to be so, to my latest age,
Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay
Such honours to thee as my numbers may;
Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,
Not scorn'd in heav'n, though little notic'd here.

    Could time, his flight revers'd, restore the hours,
When, playing with thy vesture's tissued flow'rs,
The violet, the pink, and jessamine,
I prick'd them into paper with a pin,
(And thou wast happier than myself the while,
Would'st softly speak, and stroke my head and smile)
Could those few pleasant hours again appear,
Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?
I would not trust my heart—the dear delight
Seems so to be desir'd, perhaps I might.—
But no—what here we call our life is such,
So little to be lov'd, and thou so much,
That I should ill requite thee to constrain
Thy unbound spirit into bonds again.

    Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's coast
(The storms all weather'd and the ocean cross'd)
Shoots into port at some well-haven'd isle,
Where spices breathe and brighter seasons smile,
There sits quiescent on the floods that show
Her beauteous form reflected clear below,
While airs impregnated with incense play
Around her, fanning light her streamers gay;
So thou, with sails how swift! hast reach'd the shore
""Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,""
And thy lov'd consort on the dang'rous tide
Of life, long since, has anchor'd at thy side.
But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,
Always from port withheld, always distress'd—
Me howling winds drive devious, tempest toss'd,
Sails ript, seams op'ning wide, and compass lost,
And day by day some current's thwarting force
Sets me more distant from a prosp'rous course.
But oh the thought, that thou art safe, and he!
That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.
My boast is not that I deduce my birth
From loins enthron'd, and rulers of the earth;
But higher far my proud pretensions rise—
The son of parents pass'd into the skies.
And now, farewell—time, unrevok'd, has run
His wonted course, yet what I wish'd is done.
By contemplation's help, not sought in vain,
I seem t' have liv'd my childhood o'er again;
To have renew'd the joys that once were mine,
Without the sin of violating thine:
And, while the wings of fancy still are free,
And I can view this mimic shew of thee,
Time has but half succeeded in his theft—
Thyself remov'd, thy power to sooth me left.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Parenthood', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Elegy', 'Metaphor', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44031/on-receipt-of-my-mothers-picture,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-cowper,,1731.0,1800.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

They left their outcast mate behind, 
And scudded still before the wind. 
 
Some succour yet they could afford; 
         And, such as storms allow, 
The cask, the coop, the floated cord, 
         Delay'd not to bestow. 
But he (they knew) nor ship, nor shore, 
Whate'er they gave, should visit more. 
 
Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could he 
         Their haste himself condemn, 
Aware that flight, in such a sea, 
         Alone could rescue them; 
Yet bitter felt it still to die 
Deserted, and his friends so nigh. 
 
He long survives, who lives an hour 
         In ocean, self-upheld; 
And so long he, with unspent pow'r, 
         His destiny repell'd; 
And ever, as the minutes flew, 
Entreated help, or cried—Adieu! 
 
At length, his transient respite past, 
         His comrades, who before 
Had heard his voice in ev'ry blast, 
         Could catch the sound no more. 
For then, by toil subdued, he drank 
The stifling wave, and then he sank. 
 
No poet wept him: but the page 
         Of narrative sincere; 
That tells his name, his worth, his age, 
         Is wet with Anson's tear. 
And tears by bards or heroes shed 
Alike immortalize the dead. 
 
I therefore purpose not, or dream, 
         Descanting on his fate, 
To give the melancholy theme 
         A more enduring date: 
But misery still delights to trace 
   Its semblance in another's case. 
 
No voice divine the storm allay'd, 
         No light propitious shone; 
When, snatch'd from all effectual aid, 
         We perish'd, each alone: 
But I beneath a rougher sea, 
And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Elegy', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44027/the-castaway,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-cowper,,1731.0,1800.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Cowper,1731–1800,On the Loss of the Royal George,"Toll for the brave—
The brave! that are no more:
   All sunk beneath the wave,
Fast by their native shore.
   Eight hundred of the brave,
Whose courage well was tried,
   Had made the vessel heel
And laid her on her side;
   A land-breeze shook the shrouds,
And she was overset;
   Down went the Royal George,
With all her crew complete.

     Toll for the brave—
Brave Kempenfelt is gone,
   His last sea-fight is fought,
His work of glory done.
   It was not in the battle,
No tempest gave the shock,
   She sprang no fatal leak,
She ran upon no rock;
   His sword was in the sheath,
His fingers held the pen,
   When Kempenfelt went down
With twice four hundred men.

     Weigh the vessel up,
Once dreaded by our foes,
   And mingle with your cup
The tears that England owes;
   Her timbers yet are sound,
And she may float again,
   Full charg'd with England's thunder,
And plough the distant main;
   But Kempenfelt is gone,
His victories are o'er;
   And he and his eight hundred
Must plough the wave no more.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44029/on-the-loss-of-the-royal-george,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-cowper,,1731.0,1800.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Cowper,1731–1800,"from The Task, Book I: The Sofa","(excerpt)

Thou know’st my praise of nature most sincere, 
And that my raptures are not conjur’d up 
To serve occasions of poetic pomp, 
But genuine, and art partner of them all. 
How oft upon yon eminence our pace 
Has slacken’d to a pause, and we have borne 
The ruffling wind, scarce conscious that it blew, 
While admiration, feeding at the eye, 
And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene. 
Thence with what pleasure have we just discern’d 
The distant plough slow-moving, and beside 
His lab’ring team, that swerv’d not from the track, 
The sturdy swain diminish’d to a boy! 
Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain 
Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o’er, 
Conducts the eye along its sinuous course 
Delighted.  There, fast rooted in his bank, 
Stand, never overlook’d, our fav’rite elms, 
That screen the herdsman’s solitary hut; 
While far beyond, and overthwart the stream 
That as with molten glass inlays the vale, 
The sloping land recedes into the clouds; 
Displaying on its varied side the grace 
Of hedge-row beauties numberless, square tow’r, 
Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells 
Just undulates upon the list’ning ear, 
Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote. 
Scenes must be beautiful which daily view’d 
Please daily, and whose novelty survives 
Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years. 
Praise justly due to those that I describe. 
 
. . .
   But though true worth and virtue, in the mild 
And genial soil of cultivated life 
Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there, 
Yet not in cities oft.  In proud and gay 
And gain-devoted cities; thither flow, 
As to a common and most noisome sewer, 
The dregs and fæculence of ev’ry land. 
In cities foul example on most minds 
Begets its likeness.  Rank abundance breeds 
In gross and pamper’d cities sloth and lust, 
And wantonness and gluttonous excess. 
In cities, vice is hidden with most ease, 
Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught 
By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there 
Beyond th’ atchievement of successful flight. 
I do confess them nurs’ries of the arts, 
In which they flourish most: where, in the beams 
Of warm encouragement, and in the eye 
Of public note, they reach their perfect size. 
Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaim’d 
The fairest capital of all the world, 
By riot and incontinence the worst. 
There, touch’d by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes 
A lucid mirror, in which Nature sees 
All her reflected features.  Bacon there 
Gives more than female beauty to a stone, 
And Chatham’s eloquence to marble lips. 
 
. . .
   God made the country, and man made the town: 
What wonder then, that health and virtue, gifts 
That can alone make sweet the bitter draught 
That life holds out to all, should most abound 
And least be threaten’d in the fields and groves? 
Possess ye therefore, ye who, borne about 
In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue 
But that of idleness, and taste no scenes 
But such as art contrives, possess ye still 
Your element; there only ye can shine, 
There only minds like yours can do no harm. 
Our groves were planted to console at noon 
The pensive wand’rer in their shades.  At eve 
The moon-beam, sliding softly in between 
The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish, 
Birds warbling all the music.  We can spare 
The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse 
Our softer satellite. Your songs confound 
Our more harmonious notes: the thrush departs 
Scar’d, and th’ offended nightingale is mute. 
There is a public mischief in your mirth, 
It plagues your country.  Folly such as your’s, 
Grac’d with a sword, and worthier of a fan, 
Has made, which enemies could ne’er have done, 
Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you,

William Cowper,1731–1800,"from The Task, Book II: The Time-Piece","(excerpt)

England, with all thy faults, I love thee still
My country! and while yet a nook is left 
Where English minds and manners may be found, 
Shall be constrain’d to love thee.  Though thy clime 
Be fickle, and thy year, most part, deform’d 
With dripping rains, or wither’d by a frost, 
I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies 
And fields without a flow’r, for warmer France 
With all her vines; nor for Ausonia’s groves 
Of golden fruitage and her myrtle bow’rs. 
To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime 
Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire 
Upon thy foes, was never meant my task: 
But I can feel thy fortunes, and partake 
Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart 
As any thund’rer there.  And I can feel 
Thy follies too, and with a just disdain 
Frown at effeminates, whose very looks 
Reflect dishonour on the land I love. 
How, in the name of soldiership and sense, 
Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth 
And tender as a girl, all essenc’d o’er 
With odors, and as profligate as sweet, 
Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath, 
And love when they should fight; when such as these 
Presume to lay their hand upon the ark 
Of her magnificent and awful cause? 
Time was when it was praise and boast enough 
In ev’ry clime, and travel where we might, 
That we were born her children.  Praise enough 
To fill th’ ambition of a private man, 
That Chatham’s language was his mother tongue, 
And Wolfe’s great name compatriot with his own. 
Farewell those honors, and farewell with them 
The hope of such hereafter!  They have fall’n 
Each in his field of glory: one in arms, 
And one in council.  Wolfe upon the lap 
Of smiling victory that moment won, 
And Chatham, heart-sick of his country’s shame. 
They made us many soldiers.  Chatham still 
Consulting England’s happiness at home, 
Secur’d it by an unforgiving frown 
If any wrong’d her.  Wolfe, where’er he fought, 
Put so much of his heart into his act, 
That his example had a magnet’s force, 
And all were swift to follow whom all loved. 
Those suns are set.  Oh rise some other such! 
Or all that we have left is empty talk 
Of old achievements, and despair of new. 
. . .
 
   There is a pleasure in poetic pains 
Which only poets know.  The shifts and turns, 
Th’ expedients and inventions multiform 
To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms 
Thought apt, yet coy, and difficult to win— 
T’ arrest the fleeting images that fill 
The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast, 
And force them sit, ’till he has pencill’d off 
A faithful likeness of the forms he views; 
Then to dispose his copies with such art 
That each may find its most propitious light, 
And shine by situation, hardly less, 
Than by the labor and the skill it cost, 
Are occupations of the poet’s mind 
So pleasing, and that steal away the thought 
With such address from themes of sad import, 
That lost in his own musings, happy man! 
He feels th’ anxieties of life, denied 
Their wonted entertainment, all retire. 
Such joys has he that sings.  But ah! not such, 
Or seldom such, the hearers of his song. 
Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps 
Aware of nothing arduous in a task 
They never undertook, they little note 
His dangers or escapes, and haply find 
There least amusement where he found the most. 
But is amusement all?  studious of song, 
And yet ambitious not to sing in vain, 
I would not trifle merely, though the world 
Be loudest in their praise who do no more. 
Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay? 
It may correct a foible, may chastise 
The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress, 
Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch; 
But where are its sublimer trophies found? 
What vice has it subdu’d? whose heart reclaim’d 
By rigour, or whom laugh’d into reform? 
Alas! Leviathan is not so tam’d:
Laugh’d at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard, 
Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales, 
That fear no discipline of human hands.
   The pulpit, therefore (and I name it, fill’d 
With solemn awe, that bids me well beware 
With what intent I touch that holy thing)
The pulpit (when the sat’rist has at last, 
Strutting and vap’ring in an empty school, 
Spent all his force and made no proselyte) 
I say the pulpit (in the sober use 
Of its legitimate, peculiar pow’rs) 
Must stand acknowledg’d, while the world shall stand, 
The most important and effectual guard, 
Support and ornament of virtue’s cause.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Nature', 'Weather', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Blank Verse', 'Allusion', 'Epic']","Source:

William Cowper,1731–1800,"from The Task, Book V: The Winter Morning Walk","(excerpt)

’Tis morning; and the sun with ruddy orb 
Ascending, fires the horizon: while the clouds 
That crowd away before the driving wind, 
More ardent as the disk emerges more, 
Resemble most some city in a blaze, 
Seen through the leafless wood.  His slanting ray 
Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale, 
And tinging all with his own rosy hue, 
From ev’ry herb and ev’ry spiry blade 
Stretches a length of shadow o’er the field. 
Mine, spindling into longitude immense, 
In spite of gravity, and sage remark 
That I myself am but a fleeting shade, 
Provokes me to a smile.  With eye askance 
I view the muscular proportion’d limb 
Transform’d to a lean shank.  The shapeless pair, 
As they design’d to mock me, at my side 
Take step for step; and as I near approach 
The cottage, walk along the plaster’d wall, 
Prepost’rous sight! the legs without the man. 
The verdure of the plain lies buried deep 
Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents, 
And coarser grass upspearing o’er the rest, 
Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine 
Conspicuous, and in bright apparel clad, 
And fledg’d with icy feathers, nod superb. 
The cattle mourn in corners where the fence 
Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep 
In unrecumbent sadness.  There they wait 
Their wonted fodder; not like hung’ring man 
Fretful if unsupply’d, but silent, meek, 
And patient of the slow-pac’d swain’s delay. 
He from the stack carves out th’ accustom’d load, 
Deep-plunging, and again deep plunging oft 
His broad keen knife into the solid mass; 
Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands, 
With such undeviating and even force 
He severs it away: no needless care 
Lest storms should overset the leaning pile 
Deciduous, or its own unbalanc’d weight. 
 
. . .
   ’Tis liberty alone that gives the flow’r 
Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume, 
And we are weeds without it.  All constraint, 
Except what wisdom lays on evil men, 
Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes 
Their progress in the road of science; blinds 
The eyesight of discov’ry, and begets, 
In those that suffer it, a sordid mind 
Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit 
To be the tenant of man’s noble form. 
Thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou art, 
With all thy loss of empire, and though squeez’d 
By public exigence till annual food 
Fails for the craving hunger of the state, 
Thee I account still happy, and the chief 
Among the nations, seeing thou art free! 
My native nook of earth! 
. . . 
 
   But there is yet a liberty unsung 
By poets, and by senators unprais’d, 
Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the powers 
Of earth and hell confed’rate take away. 
A liberty, which persecution, fraud, 
Oppression, prisons, have no pow’r to bind, 
Which whoso tastes can be enslav’d no more. 
’Tis liberty of heart, deriv’d from heav’n, 
Bought with HIS blood who gave it to mankind, 
And seal’d with the same token.  It is held 
By charter, and that charter sanction’d sure 
By th’ unimpeachable and awful oath 
And promise of a God.  His other gifts 
All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his,

William Cowper,1731–1800,"from The Task, Book IV: The Winter Evening","(excerpt)

Hark! ’tis the twanging horn! o’er yonder bridge,
That with its wearisome but needful length 
Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon 
Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright; 
He comes, the herald of a noisy world, 
With spatter’d boots, strapp’d waist, and frozen locks, 
News from all nations lumb’ring at his back. 
True to his charge, the close-pack’d load behind, 
Yet careless what he brings, his one concern 
Is to conduct it to the destin’d inn: 
And having dropp’d th’ expected bag—pass on. 
He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch, 
Cold and yet cheerful: messenger of grief 
Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some, 
To him indiff’rent whether grief or joy. 
Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks, 
Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet 
With tears, that trickled down the writer’s cheeks, 
Fast as the periods from his fluent quill, 
Or charg’d with am’rous sighs of absent swains, 
Or nymphs responsive, equally affect 
His horse and him, unconscious of them all. 
But oh th’ important budget! usher’d in 
With such heart-shaking music, who can say 
What are its tidings? have our troops awak’d? 
Or do they still, as if with opium drugg’d, 
Snore to the murmurs of th’ Atlantic wave? 
Is India free? and does she wear her plum’d 
And jewell’d turban with a smile of peace, 
Or do we grind her still? The grand debate, 
The popular harangue, the tart reply, 
The logic, and the wisdom, and the wit, 
And the loud laugh—I long to know them all; 
I burn to set th’ imprison’d wranglers free, 
And give them voice and utt’rance once again.
   Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast, 
Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round, 
And, while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn 
Throws up a steamy column, and the cups, 
That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each, 
So let us welcome peaceful ev’ning in. 
Not such his ev’ning, who with shining face 
Sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeez’d 
And bor’d with elbow-points through both his sides, 
Out-scolds the ranting actor on the stage: 
Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb, 
And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath 
Of patriots, bursting with heroic rage, 
Or placemen, all tranquility and smiles. 
This folio of four pages, happy work! 
Which not ev’n critics criticise; that holds 
Inquisitive attention, while I read, 
Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair, 
Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break; 
What is it but a map of busy life, 
Its fluctuations, and its vast concerns? 
. . .
 
   Oh Winter! ruler of th’ inverted year, 
Thy scatter’d hair with sleet like ashes fill’d, 
Thy breath congeal’d upon thy lips, thy cheeks 
Fring’d with a beard made white with other snows 
Than those of age; thy forehead wrapt in clouds, 
A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne 
A sliding car, indebted to no wheels, 
But urg’d by storms along its slipp’ry way;
I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem’st, 
And dreaded as thou art!  Thou hold’st the sun 
A pris’ner in the yet undawning East, 
Short’ning his journey between morn and noon, 
And hurrying him, impatient of his stay, 
Down to the rosy West; but kindly still 
Compensating his loss with added hours 
Of social converse and instructive ease, 
And gathering at short notice, in one group, 
The family dispers’d, and fixing thought, 
Not less dispers’d by day-light and its cares. 
I crown thee King of intimate delights, 
Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness, 
And all the comforts that the lowly roof 
Of undisturb’d retirement, and the hours 
Of long uninterrupted evening, know. 
No ratt’ling wheels stop short before these gates; 
No powder’d pert proficient in the art 
Of sounding an alarm, assaults these doors 
Till the street rings; no stationary steeds 
Cough their own knell, while, heedless of the sound, 
The silent circle fan themselves, and quake: 
But here the needle plies its busy task, 
The pattern grows, the well-depicted flow’r,
Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn, 
Unfolds its bosom; buds, and leaves, and sprigs, 
And curling tendrils, gracefully dispos’d, 
Follow the nimble finger of the fair; 
A wreath that cannot fade, or flow’rs that blow 
With most success when all besides decay. 
The poet’s or historian’s page, by one 
Made vocal for th’ amusement of the rest; 
The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds 
The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out; 
And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct, 
And in the charming strife triumphant still, 
Beguile the night, and set a keener edge 
On female industry; the threaded steel 
Flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds. 
The volume clos’d, the customary rites 
Of the last meal commence.  A Roman meal; 
Such as the mistress of the world once found 
Delicious, when her patriots of high note, 
Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors, 
And under an old oak’s domestic shade, 
Enjoy’d, spare feast! a radish and an egg. 
Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull, 
Nor such as with a frown forbids the play 
Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth: 
Nor do we madly, like an impious world, 
Who deem religion frenzy, and the God 
That made them an intruder on their joys, 
Start at his awful name, or deem his praise 
A jarring note.  Themes of a graver tone, 
Exciting oft our gratitude and love, 
While we retrace with mem’ry’s pointing wand, 
That calls the past to our exact review, 
The dangers we have ’scap’d, the broken snare, 
The disappointed foe, deliv’rance found 
Unlook’d for, life preserv’d and peace restor’d, 
Fruits of omnipotent eternal love. 
Oh ev’nings worthy of the Gods! exclaim’d 
The Sabine bard.  Oh ev’nings, I reply, 
More to be priz’d and coveted than yours, 
As more illumin’d, and with nobler truths,

William Cowper,1731–1800,"from The Task, Book VI: The Winter Walk at Noon","(excerpt)

Thus heav’n-ward all things tend. For all were once 
Perfect, and all must be at length restor’d. 
So God has greatly purpos’d; who would else 
In his dishonour’d works himself endure 
Dishonour, and be wrong’d without redress. 
Haste then, and wheel away a shatter’d world, 
Ye slow-revolving seasons! we would see, 
(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet) 
A world that does not dread and hate his laws, 
And suffer for its crime; would learn how fair 
The creature is that God pronounces good, 
How pleasant in itself what pleases him. 
Here ev’ry drop of honey hides a sting, 
Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flow’rs, 
And ev’n the joy that haply some poor heart 
Derives from heav’n, pure as the fountain 
Is sully’d in the stream; taking a taint 
From touch of human lips, at best impure. 
Oh for a world in principle as chaste 
As this is gross and selfish! over which 
Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway, 
That govern all things here, should’ring aside 
The meek and modest truth, and forcing her 
To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife 
In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men: 
Where violence shall never lift the sword, 
Nor cunning justify the proud man’s wrong, 
Leaving the poor no remedy but tears: 
Where he that fills an office, shall esteem 
Th’ occasion it presents of doing good 
More than the perquisite: Where law shall speak 
Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts 
And equity; not jealous more to guard 
A worthless form, than to decide aright: 
Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse, 
Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace) 
With lean performance ape the work of love. 
 
. . .
   He is the happy man, whose life ev’n now 
Shows somewhat of that happier life to come; 
Who, doom’d to an obscure but tranquil state, 
Is pleas’d with it, and, were he free to chuse, 
Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit 
Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith, 
Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one 
Content indeed to sojourn while he must 
Below the skies, but having there his home. 
The world o’erlooks him in her busy search 
Of objects more illustrious in her view; 
And, occupy’d as earnestly as she, 
Though more sublimely, he o’erlooks the world. 
She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not; 
He seeks not hers, for he has prov’d them vain. 
He cannot skim the ground like summer birds 
Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems 
Her honors, her emoluments, her joys. 
Therefore in contemplation is his bliss, 
Whose pow’r is such, that whom she lifts from earth 
She makes familiar with a heav’n unseen, 
And shows him glories yet to be reveal’d. 
. . .
 
So life glides smoothly and by stealth away, 
More golden than that age of fabled gold 
Renown’d in ancient song; not vex’d with care 
Or stain’d with guilt, beneficent, approv’d 
Of God and man, and peaceful in its end. 
So glide my life away! and so at last, 
My share of duties decently fulfill’d, 
May some disease, not tardy to perform 
Its destin’d office, yet with gentle stroke, 
Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat, 
Beneath a turf that I have often trod. 
It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when call’d 
To dress a Sofa with the flow’rs of verse, 
I play’d awhile, obedient to the fair, 
With that light task; but soon, to please her more 
Whom flow’rs alone I knew would little please, 
Let fall th’ unfinish’d wreath, and rov’d for fruit; 
Rov’d far, and gather’d much: some harsh, ’tis true, 
Pick’d from the thorns and briars of reproof, 
But wholesome, well-digested; grateful some 
To palates that can taste immortal truth, 
Insipid else, and sure to be despis’d. 
But all is in his hand whose praise I seek. 
In vain the poet sings, and the world hears, 
If he regard not, though divine the theme. 
’Tis not in artful measures, in the chime 
And idle tinkling of a minstrel’s lyre, 
To charm his ear, whose eye is on the heart; 
Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain, 
Whose approbation—prosper even mine.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Health & Illness', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Activities', 'Eating & Drinking', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Winter', 'Religion', 'Faith & Doubt', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Money & Economics', 'War & Conflict', 'Blank Verse', 'Imagery', 'Epic']","Source:

Deep in unfathomable mines
   Of never-failing skill,

Are big with mercy, and shall break

   He hides a smiling face.

Anna Lætitia Barbauld,1743–1825,Washing Day,"The Muses are turned gossips; they have lost
The buskined step, and clear high-sounding phrase,
Language of gods. Come, then, domestic Muse,
In slip-shod measure loosely prattling on,
Of farm or orchard, pleasant curds and cream,
Or droning flies, or shoes lost in the mire
By little whimpering boy, with rueful face —
Come, Muse, and sing the dreaded washing day.
Ye who beneath the yoke of wedlock bend,
With bowed soul, full well ye ken the day
Which week, smooth sliding after week, brings on
Too soon; for to that day nor peace belongs,
Nor comfort; ere the first grey streak of dawn,
The red-armed washers come and chase repose.
Nor pleasant smile, nor quaint device of mirth,
Ere visited that day; the very cat,
From the wet kitchen scared, and reeking hearth,
Visits the parlour, an unwonted guest.
The silent breakfast meal is soon despatched,
Uninterrupted, save by anxious looks
Cast at the louring, if sky should lour.
From that last evil, oh preserve us, heavens!
For should the skies pour down, adieu to all
Remains of quiet; then expect to hear
Of sad disasters — dirt and gravel stains
Hard to efface, and loaded lines at once
Snapped short, and linen-horse by dog thrown down,
And all the petty miseries of life.
Saints have been calm while stretched upon the rack,
And Montezuma smiled on burning coals;
But never yet did housewife notable
Greet with a smile a rainy washing day.
But grant the welkin fair, require not thou
Who callest thyself, perchance, the master there,
Or study swept, or nicely dusted coat,
Or usual ’tendence; ask not, indiscreet,
Thy stockings mended, though the yawning rents
Gape wide as Erebus; nor hope to find
Some snug recess impervious. Shouldst thou try
The ’customed garden walks, thine eye shall rue
The budding fragrance of thy tender shrubs,
Myrtle or rose, all crushed beneath the weight
Of coarse-checked apron, with impatient hand
Twitched off when showers impend; or crossing lines
Shall mar thy musings, as the wet cold sheet
Flaps in thy face abrupt. Woe to the friend
Whose evil stars have urged him forth to claim
On such a dav the hospitable rites;        
Looks blank at best, and stinted courtesy
Shall he receive; vainly he feeds his hopes
With dinner of roast chicken, savoury pie,
Or tart or pudding; pudding he nor tart
That day shall eat; nor, though the husband try —
Mending what can’t be helped — to kindle mirth
From cheer deficient, shall his consort’s brow
Clear up propitious; the unlucky guest
In silence dines, and early slinks away.
I well remember, when a child, the awe
This day struck into me; for then the maids,
I scarce knew why, looked cross, and drove me from them;
Nor soft caress could I obtain, nor hope
Usual indulgencies; jelly or creams,
Relic of costly suppers, and set by
For me their petted one; or buttered toast,
When butter was forbid; or thrilling tale
Of ghost, or witch, or murder. So I went
And sheltered me beside the parlour fire;
There my dear grandmother, eldest of forms,
Tended the little ones, and watched from harm;
Anxiously fond, though oft her spectacles
With elfin cunning hid, and oft the pins
Drawn from her ravelled stocking, might have soured
One less indulgent.
At intervals my mother’s voice was heard,
Urging dispatch; briskly the work went on,
All hands employed to wash, to rinse, to wring,
Or fold, and starch, and clap, and iron, and plait.
Then would I sit me down, and ponder much
Why washings were; sometimes through hollow hole
Of pipe amused we blew, and sent aloft
The floating bubbles; little dreaming then
To see, Montgolfier, thy silken ball
Ride buoyant through the clouds, so near approach
The sports of children and the toils of men.
Earth, air, and sky, and ocean hath its bubbles,
And verse is one of them — this most of all.",blank verse,meters,"['Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51901/washing-day,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anna-laetitia-barbauld,,1743.0,1825.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Anna Lætitia Barbauld,1743–1825,To Mr. [S.T.] C[oleridge],"Midway the hill of science, after steep
And rugged paths that tire the unpractised feet,
A grove extends; in tangled mazes wrought, 
And filled with strange enchantment: dubious shapes
Flit through dim glades, and lure the eager foot
Of youthful ardour to eternal chase.
Dreams hang on every leaf: unearthly forms
Glide through the gloom; and mystic visions swim
Before the cheated sense. Athwart the mists, 
Far into vacant space, huge shadows stretch
And seem realities; while things of life,
Obvious to sight and touch, all glowing round, 
Fade to the hue of shadows. Scruples here, 
With filmy net, most like the autumnal webs
Of floating gossamer, arrest the foot
Of generous enterprise; and palsy hope
And fair ambition with the chilling touch
Of sickly hesitation and blank fear. 
Nor seldom Indolence these lawns among
Fixes her turf-built seat; and wears the garb
Of deep philosophy, and museful sits
In dreamy twilight of the vacant mind,
Soothed by the whispering shade; for soothing soft
The shades; and vistas lengthening into air,
With moonbeam rainbows tinted. Here each mind
Of finer mould, acute and delicate, 
In its high progress to eternal truth
Rests for a space, in fairy bowers entranced;
And loves the softened light and tender gloom;
And, pampered with most unsubstantial food,
Looks down indignant on the grosser world,
And matter’s cumbrous shapings. Youth beloved
Of science — of the Muse beloved, — not here, 
Not in the maze of metaphysic lore,
Build thou thy place of resting! Lightly tread
The dangerous ground, on noble aims intent; 
And be this Circe of the studious cell
Enjoyed, but still subservient. Active scenes
Shall soon with healthful spirit brace thy mind;
And fair exertion, for bright fame sustained,
For friends, for country, chase each spleen-fed fog

Deadde still the aire, and eke the welken blue,
When from the sea arist in drear arraie

The which full fast unto the woodlande drewe,
Hiltring attenes the sunnis fetive face,
And the blacke tempeste swolne and gatherd up apace.

Pore in his newe, ungentle in his weede,
Longe bretful of the miseries of neede,
Where from the hail-stone coulde the almer flie?
He had no housen theere, ne anie covent nie.

Look in his glommed face, his sprighte there scanne;
Howe woe-be-gone, how withered, forwynd, deade!

The welkin opes; the yellow levynne flies;
And the hot fierie smothe in the wide lowings dies.

Cheves slowlie on, and then embollen clangs,
Shakes the hie spyre, and losst, dispended, drown’d,
Still on the gallard eare of terroure hanges;

And his pencte gyrdle met with mickle shame;

Ann Yearsley,1752–1806,The Indifferent Shepherdess to Colin,"Colin, why this mistake?
 Why plead thy foolish love?
My heart shall sooner break
 Than I a minion prove;
Nor care I half a rush,
 No snare I spread for thee:
Go home, my friend, and blush
 For love and liberty.

Remembrance is my own —
 Dominion bright and clear,
Truth there was ever known
 To combat every care:
One image there impressed
 Through life shall ever be
Whilst my innocuous breast
 Owns love of liberty.

I ever taught thee how
 To prize the soul entire,
When on the mountain’s brow
 I turned my rural lyre:
Thou servile art and vain,
 Thy love unworthy me!
Away! nor hear my strain,
 Of love or liberty.

What arts need I display
 To woo a soul like thine?
Thou ne’re canst know the way
 My memory to confine;
For my eternal plan
 Is to be calm and free.
Estranged from tyrant man
 I’ll keep my liberty.

Yon woods their foliage wear,
 Be thou away or nigh;
The warblers of the year
 Instruct me not to sigh:
My tears ne’er roll the steep,
 Nor swell the restless sea,
Except for those who sleep
 Bereft of liberty.

Slave to commanding eyes!
 Those eyes thou wouldst commend
My judgment must despise —
 My pity is thy friend:
If eyes alone can move
 A swain so dull as thee,
They mean but to reprove
 Thy loss of liberty.

I stray o’er rocks and fields
 Where native beauties shine:
All fettered fancy yields
 Be, Colin, ever thine.
Complain no more! but rove —
 My cheek from crimson free,
Within my native grove
 I’ll guard my liberty.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'Pastoral', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51905/the-indifferent-shepherdess-to-colin,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/ann-yearsley,,1752.0,1806.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

And my father sold me while yet my tongue
Could scarcely cry "" 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!""
So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.

There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head
That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said,
""Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare,
You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.""

And so he was quiet, & that very night,
As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight!
That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack,
Were all of them locked up in coffins of black;

And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
And he opened the coffins & set them all free;
Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run,
And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.

Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,
They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.
And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
He'd have God for his father & never want joy.

And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark
And got with our bags & our brushes to work.
Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm;

Piping songs of pleasant glee 
On a cloud I saw a child. 
And he laughing said to me. 
 
Pipe a song about a Lamb;

Piper pipe that song again— 
So I piped, he wept to hear. 
 
Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe 
Sing thy songs of happy chear,

While he wept with joy to hear 
 
Piper sit thee down and write 
In a book that all may read—

Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies.

On what wings dare he aspire?

Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat.
What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp.
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears 
And water'd heaven with their tears:
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Mary Robinson,1758–1800,London’s Summer Morning,"Who has not waked to list the busy sounds 
Of summer’s morning, in the sultry smoke 
Of noisy London? On the pavement hot 
The sooty chimney-boy, with dingy face 
And tattered covering, shrilly bawls his trade, 
Rousing the sleepy housemaid. At the door 
The milk-pail rattles, and the tinkling bell 
Proclaims the dustman’s office; while the street 
Is lost in clouds impervious. Now begins 
The din of hackney-coaches, waggons, carts; 
While tinmen’s shops, and noisy trunk-makers, 
Knife-grinders, coopers, squeaking cork-cutters, 
Fruit-barrows, and the hunger-giving cries 
Of vegetable-vendors, fill the air. 
Now every shop displays its varied trade, 
And the fresh-sprinkled pavement cools the feet 
Of early walkers. At the private door 
The ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop, 
Annoying the smart ’prentice, or neat girl, 
Tripping with band-box lightly. Now the sun 
Darts burning splendor on the glittering pane, 
Save where the canvas awning throws a shade 
On the gay merchandise. Now, spruce and trim, 
In shops (where beauty smiles with industry) 
Sits the smart damsel; while the passenger 
Peeps through the window, watching every charm. 
Now pastry dainties catch the eye minute 
Of humming insects, while the limy snare 
Waits to enthrall them. Now the lamp-lighter 
Mounts the tall ladder, nimbly venturous, 
To trim the half-filled lamps, while at his feet 
The pot-boy yells discordant! All along 
The sultry pavement, the old-clothes-man cries 
In tone monotonous, while sidelong views 
The area for his traffic: now the bag 
Is slyly opened, and the half-worn suit 
(Sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base 
Domestic spoiler), for one half its worth, 
Sinks in the green abyss. The porter now 
Bears his huge load along the burning way; 
And the poor poet wakes from busy dreams, 
To paint the summer morning.",blank verse,meters,"['Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Blank Verse']","Source:

Robert Burns,1759–1796,Tam O 'Shanter,"When chapman billies leave the street, 
And drouthy neebors neebors meet, 
As market-days are wearing late, 
And folk begin to tak the gate; 
While we sit bousin, at the nappy, 
And gettin fou and unco happy, 
We think na on the lang Scots miles, 
The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles, 
That lie between us and our hame, 
Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame, 
Gathering her brows like gathering storm, 
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. 
 
         This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter, 
As he frae Ayr ae night did canter: 
(Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses, 
For honest men and bonie lasses.) 
 
         O Tam! had'st thou but been sae wise 
As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice! 
She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, 
A bletherin, blusterin, drunken blellum; 
That frae November till October, 
Ae market-day thou was na sober; 
That ilka melder wi' the miller, 
Thou sat as lang as thou had siller; 
That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on, 
The smith and thee gat roarin fou on; 
That at the Lord's house, ev'n on Sunday, 
Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday. 
She prophesied, that, late or soon, 
Thou would be found deep drown'd in Doon; 
Ot catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk, 
By Alloway's auld haunted kirk. 
 
         Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet, 
To think how mony counsels sweet, 
How mony lengthen'd sage advices, 
The husband frae the wife despises! 
 
         But to our tale:—Ae market night, 
Tam had got planted unco right, 
Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely, 
Wi' reaming swats that drank divinely; 
And at his elbow, Souter Johnie, 
His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony: 
Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither; 
They had been fou for weeks thegither. 
The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter; 
And ay the ale was growing better: 
The landlady and Tam grew gracious 
Wi' secret favours, sweet, and precious: 
The souter tauld his queerest stories; 
The landlord's laugh was ready chorus: 
The storm without might rair and rustle, 
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle. 
 
         Care, mad to see a man sae happy, 
E'en drown'd himsel amang the nappy: 
As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure, 
The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure; 
Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious, 
O'er a' the ills o' life victorious! 
 
         But pleasures are like poppies spread, 
You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed; 
Or like the snow falls in the river, 
A moment white—then melts forever; 
Or like the borealis race, 
That flit ere you can point their place; 
Or like the rainbow's lovely form 
Evanishing amid the storm. 
Nae man can tether time or tide: 
The hour approaches Tam maun ride,— 
That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane 
That dreary hour he mounts his beast in; 
And sic a night he taks the road in, 
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in. 
 
         The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last; 
The rattling show'rs rose on the blast; 
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd; 
Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellow'd: 
That night, a child might understand, 
The Deil had business on his hand. 
 
         Weel mounted on his grey mare, Meg,— 
A better never lifted leg,— 
Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire, 
Despising wind and rain and fire; 
Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet, 
Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet, 
Whiles glowrin round wi' prudent cares, 
Lest bogles catch him unawares. 
Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, 
Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry. 
 
         By this time he was cross the ford, 
Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd; 
And past the birks and meikle stane, 
Whare drucken Charlie brak's neckbane: 
And thro' the whins, and by the cairn, 
Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn; 
And near the thorn, aboon the well, 
Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel. 
Before him Doon pours all his floods; 
The doubling storm roars thro' the woods; 
The lightnings flash from pole to pole, 
Near and more near the thunders roll; 
When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees, 
Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze: 
Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing, 
And loud resounded mirth and dancing. 
 
         Inspiring bold John Barleycorn! 
What dangers thou can'st make us scorn! 
Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil; 
Wi' usquebae we'll face the devil! 
The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle, 
Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle. 
But Maggie stood right sair astonish'd, 
Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd, 
She ventur'd forward on the light; 
And, wow! Tam saw an unco sight! 
 
         Warlocks and witches in a dance; 
Nae cotillion brent-new frae France, 
But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels 
Put life and mettle in their heels. 
A winnock bunker in the east, 
There sat Auld Nick in shape o' beast: 
A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large, 
To gie them music was his charge; 
He screw'd the pipes and gart them skirl, 
Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.— 
Coffins stood round like open presses, 
That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses; 
And by some devilish cantraip sleight 
Each in its cauld hand held a light, 
By which heroic Tam was able 
To note upon the haly table 
A murderer's banes in gibbet airns; 
Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen'd bairns; 
A thief, new-cutted frae the rape— 
Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape; 
Five tomahawks, wi' blude red-rusted; 
Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted; 
A garter, which a babe had strangled; 
A knife, a father's throat had mangled, 
Whom his ain son o' life bereft— 
The grey hairs yet stack to the heft; 
Wi' mair o' horrible and awfu', 
Which ev'n to name wad be unlawfu'. 
 
         As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd and curious, 
The mirth and fun grew fast and furious: 
The piper loud and louder blew, 
The dancers quick and quicker flew; 
They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit 
Till ilka carlin swat and reekit 
And coost her duddies to the wark 
And linket at it in her sark! 
 
         Now Tam, O Tam! had thae been queans, 
A' plump and strapping in their teens! 
Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen, 
Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!— 
Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair, 
That ance were plush, o' gude blue hair, 
I wad hae gien them aff y hurdies, 
For ae blink o' the bonie burdies! 
 
         But wither'd beldams, auld and droll, 
Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal, 
Lowping and flinging on a crummock. 
I wonder didna turn thy stomach. 
 
         But Tam ken'd what was what fu' brawlie; 
There was ae winsom wench and walie, 
That night enlisted in the core 
(Lang after ken'd on Carrick shore. 
For mony a beast to dead she shot, 
And perish'd mony a bonie boat, 
And shook baith meikle corn and bear, 
And kept the country-side in fear); 
Her cutty sark o' Paisley harn, 
That while a lassie she had worn, 
In longitude tho' sorely scanty, 
It was her best, and she was vauntie. 
Ah! little ken'd thy reverend grannie, 
That sark she coft for her wee Nannie, 
Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches), 
Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches! 
 
         But here my Muse her wing maun cow'r, 
Sic flights are far beyond her pow'r; 
To sing how Nannie lap and flang, 
(A souple jad she was and strang), 
And how Tam stood like ane bewitch'd, 
And thought his very een enrich'd; 
Even Satan glowr'd and fidg'd fu' fain, 
And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main: 
Till first ae caper, syne anither, 
Tam tint his reason a' thegither, 
And roars out, ""Weel done, Cutty-sark!"" 
And in an instant all was dark: 
And scarcely had he Maggie rallied, 
When out the hellish legion sallied. 
 
         As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke, 
When plundering herds assail their byke; 
As open pussie's mortal foes, 
When, pop! she starts before their nose; 
As eager runs the market-crowd, 
When ""Catch the thief!"" resounds aloud; 
So Maggie runs, the witches follow, 
Wi' mony an eldritch skriech and hollo. 
 
         Ah, Tam! ah, Tam! thou'll get thy fairin! 
In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin! 
In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin! 
Kate soon will be a woefu' woman! 
Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg, 
And win the key-stane of the brig: 
There at them thou thy tail may toss, 
A running stream they dare na cross. 
But ere the key-stane she could make, 
The fient a tail she had to shake! 
For Nannie far before the rest, 
Hard upon noble Maggie prest, 
And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle; 
But little wist she Maggie's mettle— 
Ae spring brought aff her master hale 
But left behind her ain grey tail: 
The carlin claught her by the rump, 
And left poor Maggie scarce a stump. 
 
         Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read, 
Ilk man and mother's son, take heed, 
Whene'er to drink you are inclin'd, 
Or cutty-sarks run in your mind,

   With mattock and with spade,
And silent, by the torches’ light,
   His corse in earth we laid.

 The coffin bore his name, that those
   Of other years might know,
When earth its secrets should disclose,
   Whose bones were laid below.

 “Peace to the dead” no children sung,
   Slow pacing up the nave,—
No prayers were read, no knell was rung,
   As deep we dug his grave.

 We only heard the winter's wind,
   In many a sullen gust,
As, o’er the open grave inclined,
   We murmured, “Dust to dust!”

 A moonbeam from the arch’s height
   Streamed, as we placed the stone;
The long aisles started into light,
   And all the windows shone.

 We thought we saw the banners then,
   That shook along the walls,
Whilst the sad shades of mailèd men
   Were gazing on the stalls.

 ’Tis gone! again on tombs defaced
   Sits darkness more profound;
And only by the torch we traced
   The shadows on the ground.

 And now the chilling, freezing air
   Without blew long and loud;
Upon our knees we breathed one prayer,
   Where he slept in his shroud.

 We laid the broken marble floor,—
   No name, no trace appears,—

When infant Reason first exerts her sway,
And new-formed thoughts their earliest charms display;
Then let the growing race employ your care
Then guard their opening minds from Folly’s snare;
Correct the rising passions of their youth,
Teach them each serious, each important truth;
Plant heavenly virtue in the tender breast,
Destroy each vice that might its growth molest;
Point out betimes the course they should pursue;
Then with redoubled pleasure shall you view
Their reason strengthen as their years increase,
Their virtue ripen and their follies cease;

Dull would he be of soul who could pass by

Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!

William Wordsworth,1770 – 1850,Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight
                 To me did seem
            Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
             Turn wheresoe’er I may,
              By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

            The rainbow comes and goes,
            And lovely is the rose;
            The moon doth with delight
     Look round her when the heavens are bare;
            Waters on a starry night
            Are beautiful and fair;
     The sunshine is a glorious birth;
     But yet I know, where’er I go,
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.

Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
     And while the young lambs bound
            As to the tabor’s sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
            And I again am strong.
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep,—
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong:
I hear the echoes through the mountains throng.
The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
            And all the earth is gay;
                Land and sea
     Give themselves up to jollity,
            And with the heart of May
     Doth every beast keep holiday;—
                Thou child of joy,
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy
        Shepherd-boy!
                 Ye blesséd Creatures, I have heard the call 
     Ye to each other make; I see
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
     My heart is at your festival,
       My head hath its coronal,
The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.
         O evil day! if I were sullen
         While Earth herself is adorning
              This sweet May-morning;
         And the children are culling
              On every side
         In a thousand valleys far and wide
         Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm:—
         I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
         —But there’s a tree, of many, one,
A single field which I have look’d upon,
Both of them speak of something that is gone:
              The pansy at my feet
              Doth the same tale repeat:
Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;
The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,
          Hath had elsewhere its setting
               And cometh from afar;
          Not in entire forgetfulness,
          And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come 
               From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
               Upon the growing Boy,
But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
               He sees it in his joy;
The Youth, who daily farther from the east
     Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,
          And by the vision splendid
          Is on his way attended;
At length the Man perceives it die away,
And fade into the light of common day.

Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
And, even with something of a mother‘s mind,
               And no unworthy aim,
          The homely nurse doth all she can
To make her foster-child, her inmate, Man,
               Forget the glories he hath known,
And that imperial palace whence he came.

Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
A six years’ darling of a pigmy size!
See, where ‘mid work of his own hand he lies,
Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,
With light upon him from his father’s eyes!
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
Some fragment from his dream of human life,
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
          A wedding or a festival,
          A mourning or a funeral;
               And this hath now his heart,
          And unto this he frames his song:
               Then will he fit his tongue
To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
          But it will not be long
          Ere this be thrown aside,
          And with new joy and pride
The little actor cons another part;
Filling from time to time his ‘humorous stage’
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
That life brings with her in her equipage;
          As if his whole vocation
          Were endless imitation.

Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
          Thy soul’s immensity;
Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep
Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind,
That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep,
Haunted for ever by the eternal Mind,—
          Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!
          On whom those truths rest
Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
Thou, over whom thy Immortality
Broods like the day, a master o’er a slave,
A Presence which is not to be put by;
          To whom the grave
Is but a lonely bed, without the sense of sight

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Yarrow Unvisited,"From Stirling castle we had seen
The mazy Forth unravelled;
Had trod the banks of Clyde, and Tay,
And with the Tweed had travelled;
And when we came to Clovenford,
Then said my ""winsome Marrow ,""
""Whate'er betide, we'll turn aside,
And see the Braes of Yarrow.""
""Let Yarrow folk, frae Selkirk town,
Who have been buying, selling,
Go back to Yarrow, 'tis their own;
Each maiden to her dwelling!
On Yarrow's banks let her herons feed,
Hares couch, and rabbits burrow!
But we will downward with the Tweed
Nor turn aside to Yarrow.
""There's Galla Water, Leader Haughs,
Both lying right before us;
And Dryborough, where with chiming Tweed
The lintwhites sing in chorus;
There's pleasant Tiviot-dale, a land
Made blithe with plough and harrow:
Why throw away a needful day
To go in search of Yarrow?
""What's Yarrow but a river bare,
That glides the dark hills under?
There are a thousand such elsewhere
As worthy of your wonder.""
—Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn;
My True-love sighed for sorrow;
And looked me in the face, to think
I thus could speak of Yarrow!
""Oh! green,"" said I, ""are Yarrow's holms,
And sweet is Yarrow flowing!
Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,
But we will leave it growing.
O'er hilly path, and open Strath,
We'll wander Scotland thorough;
But, though so near, we will not turn
Into the dale of Yarrow.
""Let beeves and home-bred kine partake
The sweets of Burn-mill meadow,
The swan on still St. Mary's Lake
Float double, swan and shadow!
We will not see them; will not go,
To-day, nor yet to-morrow;
Enough if in our hearts we know
There's such a place as Yarrow.
""Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!
It must, or we shall rue it:
We have a vision of our own;
Ah! why should we undo it?
The treasured dreams of times long past,
We'll keep them, winsome Marrow!
For when we'er there, although 'tis fair,
'Twill be another Yarrow!
""If Care with freezing years should come,
And wandering seem but folly,—
Should we be loth to stir from home,
And yet be melancholy;
Should life be dull, and spirits low,
'Twill soothe us in our sorrow,

The bonny holms of Yarrow!""",ballad,verse forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45568/yarrow-unvisited,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,"Yarrow Visited. September, 1814","And is this—Yarrow?—This the stream
Of which my fancy cherished,
So faithfully, a waking dream?
An image that hath perished!
O that some Minstrel's harp were near,
To utter notes of gladness,
And chase this silence from the air,
That fills my heart with sadness!

Yet why?—a silvery current flows
With uncontrolled meanderings;
Nor have these eyes by greener hills
Been soothed, in all my wanderings.
And, through her depths, Saint Mary's Lake
Is visibly delighted;
For not a feature of those hills
Is in the mirror slighted.

A blue sky bends o'er Yarrow vale,
Save where that pearly whiteness
Is round the rising sun diffused,
A tender hazy brightness;
Mild dawn of promise! that excludes
All profitless dejection;
Though not unwilling here to admit
A pensive recollection.

Where was it that the famous Flower
Of Yarrow Vale lay bleeding?
His bed perchance was yon smooth mound
On which the herd is feeding:
And haply from this crystal pool,
Now peaceful as the morning,
The Water-wraith ascended thrice—
And gave his doleful warning.

Delicious is the Lay that sings
The haunts of happy Lovers,
The path that leads them to the grove,
The leafy grove that covers:
And Pity sanctifies the Verse
That paints, by strength of sorrow,
The unconquerable strength of love;
Bear witness, rueful Yarrow!

But thou, that didst appear so fair
To fond imagination,
Dost rival in the light of day
Her delicate creation:
Meek loveliness is round thee spread,
A softness still and holy;
The grace of forest charms decayed,
And pastoral melancholy.

That region left, the vale unfolds
Rich groves of lofty stature,
With Yarrow winding through the pomp
Of cultivated nature;
And, rising from those lofty groves,
Behold a Ruin hoary!
The shattered front of Newark's Towers,
Renowned in Border story.

Fair scenes for childhood's opening bloom,
For sportive youth to stray in;
For manhood to enjoy his strength;
And age to wear away in!
Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,
A covert for protection
Of tender thoughts, that nestle there—
The brood of chaste affection.

How sweet, on this autumnal day,
The wild-wood fruits to gather,
And on my True-love's forehead plant
A crest of blooming heather!
And what if I enwreathed my own!
'Twere no offence to reason;
The sober Hills thus deck their brows
To meet the wintry season.

I see—but not by sight alone,
Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;
A ray of fancy still survives—
Her sunshine plays upon thee!
Thy ever-youthful waters keep
A course of lively pleasure;
And gladsome notes my lips can breathe,
Accordant to the measure.

The vapours linger round the Heights,
They melt, and soon must vanish;
One hour is theirs, nor more is mine—
Sad thought, which I would banish,
But that I know, where'er I go,
Thy genuine image, Yarrow!
Will dwell with me—to heighten joy,
And cheer my mind in sorrow.",ballad,verse forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45567/yarrow-visited-september-1814,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Yarrow Revisited,"The gallant Youth, who may have gained,
   Or seeks, a ""winsome Marrow,""
Was but an Infant in the lap
   When first I looked on Yarrow;
Once more, by Newark's Castle-gate
   Long left without a warder,
I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee,
   Great Minstrel of the Border!

Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,
   Their dignity installing
In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves
   Were on the bough, or falling;
But breezes played, and sunshine gleamed-
   The forest to embolden;
Reddened the fiery hues, and shot
   Transparence through the golden.

For busy thoughts the Stream flowed on
   In foamy agitation;
And slept in many a crystal pool
   For quiet contemplation:
No public and no private care
   The freeborn mind enthralling,
We made a day of happy hours,
   Our happy days recalling.

Brisk Youth appeared, the Morn of youth,
   With freaks of graceful folly,-
Life's temperate Noon, her sober Eve,
   Her Night not melancholy;
Past, present, future, all appeared
   In harmony united,
Like guests that meet, and some from far,
   By cordial love invited.

And if, as Yarrow, through the woods
   And down the meadow ranging,
Did meet us with unaltered face,
   Though we were changed and changing;
If, then, some natural shadows spread
   Our inward prospect over,
The soul's deep valley was not slow
   Its brightness to recover.

Eternal blessings on the Muse,
   And her divine employment!
The blameless Muse, who trains her Sons
   For hope and calm enjoyment;
Albeit sickness, lingering yet,
   Has o'er their pillow brooded;
And Care waylays their steps-a Sprite
   Not easily eluded.

For thee, O Scott! compelled to change
   Green Eildon-hill and Cheviot
For warm Vesuvio's vine-clad slopes;
   And leave thy Tweed and Tiviot
For mild Sorrento's breezy waves;
   May classic Fancy, linking
With native Fancy her fresh aid,
   Preserve thy heart from sinking!

Oh! while they minister to thee,
   Each vying with the other,
May Health return to mellow Age
   With Strength, her venturous brother;
And Tiber, and each brook and rill
   Renowned in song and story,
With unimagined beauty shine,
   Nor lose one ray of glory!

For Thou, upon a hundred streams,
   By tales of love and sorrow,
Of faithful love, undaunted truth
   Hast shed the power of Yarrow;
And streams unknown, hills yet unseen,
   Wherever they invite Thee,
At parent Nature's grateful call,
   With gladness must requite Thee.

A gracious welcome shall be thine,
   Such looks of love and honour
As thy own Yarrow gave to me
   When first I gazed upon her;
Beheld what I had feared to see,
   Unwilling to surrender
Dreams treasured up from early days,
   The holy and the tender.

And what, for this frail world, were all
   That mortals do or suffer,
Did no responsive harp, no pen,
   Memorial tribute offer?
Yea, what were mighty Nature's self?
   Her features, could they win us,
Unhelped by the poetic voice
   That hourly speaks within us?

Nor deem that localized Romance
   Plays false with our affections;
Unsanctifies our tears-made sport
   For fanciful dejections:
Ah, no! the visions of the past
   Sustain the heart in feeling
Life as she is-our changeful Life,
   With friends and kindred dealing.

Bear witness, Ye, whose thoughts that day
   In Yarrow's groves were centred;
Who through the silent portal arch
   Of mouldering Newark entered;
And clomb the winding stair that once
   Too timidly was mounted
By the ""last Minstrel,""(not the last!)
   Ere he his Tale recounted.

Flow on for ever, Yarrow Stream!
   Fulfil thy pensive duty,
Well pleased that future Bards should chant
   For simple hearts thy beauty;
To dream-light dear while yet unseen,
   Dear to the common sunshine,
And dearer still, as now I feel,
   To memory's shadowy moonshine!",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Health & Illness', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Philosophy', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45566/yarrow-revisited,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,The Reverie of Poor Susan,"At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears,
Hangs a Thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years:
Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard
In the silence of morning the song of the Bird.

'Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees
A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;
Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide,
And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.

Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,
Down which she so often has tripped with her pail;
And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,
The one only dwelling on earth that she loves.

She looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade,
The mist and the river, the hill and the shade:
The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,
And the colours have all passed away from her eyes!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Animals', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45546/the-reverie-of-poor-susan,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Character of the Happy Warrior,"Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he
That every man in arms should wish to be?
—It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought
Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought
Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:
Whose high endeavours are an inward light
That makes the path before him always bright;
Who, with a natural instinct to discern
What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;
Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,
But makes his moral being his prime care;
Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,
And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!
Turns his necessity to glorious gain;
In face of these doth exercise a power
Which is our human nature's highest dower:
Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
Of their bad influence, and their good receives:
By objects, which might force the soul to abate
Her feeling, rendered more compassionate;
Is placable—because occasions rise
So often that demand such sacrifice;
More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,
As tempted more; more able to endure,
As more exposed to suffering and distress;
Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
—'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends
Upon that law as on the best of friends;
Whence, in a state where men are tempted still
To evil for a guard against worse ill,
And what in quality or act is best
Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,
He labours good on good to fix, and owes
To virtue every triumph that he knows:
—Who, if he rise to station of command,
Rises by open means; and there will stand
On honourable terms, or else retire,
And in himself possess his own desire;
Who comprehends his trust, and to the same
Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;
And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;
Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,
Like showers of manna, if they come at all:
Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,
Or mild concerns of ordinary life,
A constant influence, a peculiar grace;
But who, if he be called upon to face
Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
Great issues, good or bad for human kind,
Is happy as a Lover; and attired
With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;
And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law
In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;
Or if an unexpected call succeed,
Come when it will, is equal to the need:
—He who, though thus endued as with a sense
And faculty for storm and turbulence,
Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans
To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;
Sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be,
Are at his heart; and such fidelity
It is his darling passion to approve;
More brave for this, that he hath much to love:—
'Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,
Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,
Or left unthought-of in obscurity,—
Who, with a toward or untoward lot,
Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not—
Plays, in the many games of life, that one
Where what he most doth value must be won:
Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,
Nor thought of tender happiness betray;
Who, not content that former worth stand fast,
Looks forward, persevering to the last,
From well to better, daily self-surpast:
Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,
Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,
And leave a dead unprofitable name—
Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;
And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause:
This is the happy Warrior; this is he
That every man in arms should wish to be.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Coming of Age', 'Social Commentaries', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45512/character-of-the-happy-warrior,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

When first she gleamed upon my sight;
A lovely Apparition, sent
To be a moment's ornament;

Like Twilight's, too, her dusky hair;
But all things else about her drawn
From May-time and the cheerful Dawn;
A dancing Shape, an Image gay,
To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.
I saw her upon nearer view,
A Spirit, yet a Woman too!
Her household motions light and free,
And steps of virgin-liberty;
A countenance in which did meet
Sweet records, promises as sweet;
A Creature not too bright or good
For human nature's daily food;
For transient sorrows, simple wiles,
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.
And now I see with eye serene
The very pulse of the machine;
A Being breathing thoughtful breath,
A Traveller between life and death;
The reason firm, the temperate will,
Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,"Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors","High in the breathless Hall the Minstrel sate,
And Emont's murmur mingled with the Song.—
The words of ancient time I thus translate,
A festal strain that hath been silent long:—

    ""From town to town, from tower to tower,
    The red rose is a gladsome flower.
    Her thirty years of winter past,
    The red rose is revived at last;
    She lifts her head for endless spring,
    For everlasting blossoming:
    Both roses flourish, red and white:
    In love and sisterly delight
    The two that were at strife are blended,
    And all old troubles now are ended.—
    Joy! joy to both! but most to her
    Who is the flower of Lancaster!
    Behold her how She smiles to-day
    On this great throng, this bright array!
    Fair greeting doth she send to all
    From every corner of the hall;
    But chiefly from above the board
    Where sits in state our rightful Lord,
    A Clifford to his own restored!

         ""They came with banner, spear, and shield;
    And it was proved in Bosworth-field.
    Not long the Avenger was withstood—
    Earth helped him with the cry of blood:
    St. George was for us, and the might
    Of blessed Angels crowned the right.
    Loud voice the Land has uttered forth,
    We loudest in the faithful north:
    Our fields rejoice, our mountains ring,
    Our streams proclaim a welcoming;
    Our strong-abodes and castles see
    The glory of their loyalty.

         ""How glad is Skipton at this hour—
    Though lonely, a deserted Tower;
    Knight, squire, and yeoman, page and groom,
    We have them at the feast of Brough'm.
    How glad Pendragon—though the sleep
    Of years be on her!—She shall reap
    A taste of this great pleasure, viewing
    As in a dream her own renewing.
    Rejoiced is Brough, right glad, I deem,
    Beside her little humble stream;
    And she that keepeth watch and ward
    Her statelier Eden's course to guard;
    They both are happy at this hour,
    Though each is but a lonely Tower:—
    But here is perfect joy and pride
    For one fair House by Emont's side,
    This day, distinguished without peer,
    To see her Master and to cheer—
    Him, and his Lady-mother dear!

         ""Oh! it was a time forlorn
    When the fatherless was born—
    Give her wings that she may fly,
    Or she sees her infant die!
    Swords that are with slaughter wild
    Hunt the Mother and the Child.
    Who will take them from the light?
    —Yonder is a man in sight—
    Yonder is a house—but where?
    No, they must not enter there.
    To the caves, and to the brooks,
    To the clouds of heaven she looks;
    She is speechless, but her eyes
    Pray in ghostly agonies.
    Blissful Mary, Mother mild,
    Maid and Mother undefiled,
    Save a Mother and her Child!

         ""Now who is he that bounds with joy
    On Carrock's side, a Shepherd-boy?
    No thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass
    Light as the wind along the grass.
    Can this be He who hither came
    In secret, like a smothered flame?
    O'er whom such thankful tears were shed
    For shelter, and a poor man's bread!
    God loves the Child; and God hath willed
    That those dear words should be fulfilled,
    The Lady's words, when forced away
    The last she to her Babe did say:
    ""My own, my own, thy fellow-guest
    I may not be; but rest thee, rest,
    For lowly shepherd's life is best!""

         ""Alas! when evil men are strong
    No life is good, no pleasure long.
    The Boy must part from Mosedale's groves,
    And leave Blencathara's rugged coves,
    And quit the flowers that summer brings
    To Glenderamakin's lofty springs;
    Must vanish, and his careless cheer
    Be turned to heaviness and fear.
    —Give Sir Lancelot Threlkeld praise!
    Hear it, good man, old in days!
    Thou tree of covert and of rest
    For this young Bird that is distrest;
    Among thy branches safe he lay,
    And he was free to sport and play,
    When falcons were abroad for prey.

         ""A recreant harp, that sings of fear
    And heaviness in Clifford's ear!
    I said, when evil men are strong,
    No life is good, no pleasure long,
    A weak and cowardly untruth!
    Our Clifford was a happy Youth,
    And thankful through a weary time,
    That brought him up to manhood's prime.
    —Again he wanders forth at will,
    And tends a flock from hill to hill:
    His garb is humble; ne'er was seen
    Such garb with such a noble mien;
    Among the shepherd-grooms no mate
    Hath he, a Child of strength and state!
    Yet lacks not friends for simple glee,
    Nor yet for higher sympathy.

    To his side the fallow-deer
    Came and rested without fear;
    The eagle, lord of land and sea,
    Stooped down to pay him fealty;
    And both the undying fish that swim
    Through Bowscale-tarn did wait on him;
    The pair were servants of his eye
    In their immortality;
    And glancing, gleaming, dark or bright,
    Moved to and fro, for his delight.
    He knew the rocks which Angels haunt
    Upon the mountains visitant;
    He hath kenned them taking wing:
    And into caves where Faeries sing
    He hath entered; and been told
    By Voices how men lived of old.
    Among the heavens his eye can see
    The face of thing that is to be;
    And, if that men report him right,
    His tongue could whisper words of might.
    —Now another day is come,
    Fitter hope, and nobler doom;
    He hath thrown aside his crook,
    And hath buried deep his book;
    Armour rusting in his halls
    On the blood of Clifford calls,—
    'Quell the Scot,' exclaims the Lance—
    Bear me to the heart of France,
    Is the longing of the Shield—
    Tell thy name, thou trembling field;
    Field of death, where'er thou be,
    Groan thou with our victory!
    Happy day, and mighty hour,
    When our Shepherd, in his power,
    Mailed and horsed, with lance and sword,
    To his ancestors restored
    Like a re-appearing Star,
    Like a glory from afar
    First shall head the flock of war!""

Alas! the impassioned minstrel did not know
How, by Heaven's grace, this Clifford's heart was framed:
How he, long forced in humble walks to go,
Was softened into feeling, soothed, and tamed.

Love had he found in huts where poor men lie;
His daily teachers had been woods and rills,
The silence that is in the starry sky,
The sleep that is among the lonely hills.

In him the savage virtue of the Race,
Revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead:
Nor did he change; but kept in lofty place
The wisdom which adversity had bred.

Glad were the vales, and every cottage-hearth;
The Shepherd-lord was honoured more and more;
And, ages after he was laid in earth,
""The good Lord Clifford"" was the name he bore.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'Crime & Punishment', 'History & Politics', 'Money & Economics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Mixed']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45555/song-at-the-feast-of-brougham-castle-upon-the-restoration-of-lord-clifford-the-shepherd-to-the-estates-and-honours-of-his-ancestors,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,To a Highland Girl,"(At Inversneyde, upon Loch Lomond)

Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower
Of beauty is thy earthly dower!
Twice seven consenting years have shed
Their utmost bounty on thy head:
And these grey rocks; that household lawn;
Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;
This fall of water that doth make
A murmur near the silent lake;
This little bay; a quiet road
That holds in shelter thy Abode—
In truth together do ye seem
Like something fashioned in a dream;
Such Forms as from their covert peep
When earthly cares are laid asleep!
But, O fair Creature! in the light
Of common day, so heavenly bright,
I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,
I bless thee with a human heart;
God shield thee to thy latest years!
Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;
And yet my eyes are filled with tears.

     With earnest feeling I shall pray
For thee when I am far away:
For never saw I mien, or face,
In which more plainly I could trace
Benignity and home-bred sense
Ripening in perfect innocence.
Here scattered, like a random seed,
Remote from men, Thou dost not need
The embarrassed look of shy distress,
And maidenly shamefacedness:
Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
The freedom of a Mountaineer:
A face with gladness overspread!
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!
And seemliness complete, that sways
Thy courtesies, about thee plays;
With no restraint, but such as springs
From quick and eager visitings
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
Of thy few words of English speech:
A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife
That gives thy gestures grace and life!
So have I, not unmoved in mind,
Seen birds of tempest-loving kind—
Thus beating up against the wind.

     What hand but would a garland cull
For thee who art so beautiful?
O happy pleasure! here to dwell
Beside thee in some heathy dell;
Adopt your homely ways, and dress,
A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!
But I could frame a wish for thee
More like a grave reality:
Thou art to me but as a wave
Of the wild sea; and I would have
Some claim upon thee, if I could,
Though but of common neighbourhood.
What joy to hear thee, and to see!
Thy elder Brother I would be,
Thy Father—anything to thee!

     Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace
Hath led me to this lonely place.
Joy have I had; and going hence
I bear away my recompense.
In spots like these it is we prize
Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:
Then, why should I be loth to stir?
I feel this place was made for her;
To give new pleasure like the past,
Continued long as life shall last.
Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,
Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;
For I, methinks, till I grow old,
As fair before me shall behold,
As I do now, the cabin small,
The lake, the bay, the waterfall;
And thee, the spirit of them all!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Separation & Divorce', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Ode to Duty,"Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eo perductus, ut non tantum recte facere possim, sed nisi recte facere non possim"" 
 
""I am no longer good through deliberate intent, but by long habit have reached a point where I am not only able to do right, but am unable to do anything but what is right."" 
 (Seneca, Letters 120.10)

Stern Daughter of the Voice of God! 
O Duty! if that name thou love 
Who art a light to guide, a rod 
To check the erring, and reprove; 
Thou, who art victory and law 
When empty terrors overawe; 
From vain temptations dost set free; 
And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity! 
 
There are who ask not if thine eye 
Be on them; who, in love and truth, 
Where no misgiving is, rely 
Upon the genial sense of youth: 
Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot; 
Who do thy work, and know it not: 
Oh! if through confidence misplaced 
They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. 
 
Serene will be our days and bright, 
And happy will our nature be, 
When love is an unerring light, 
And joy its own security. 
And they a blissful course may hold 
Even now, who, not unwisely bold, 
Live in the spirit of this creed; 
Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need. 
 
I, loving freedom, and untried; 
No sport of every random gust, 
Yet being to myself a guide, 
Too blindly have reposed my trust: 
And oft, when in my heart was heard 
Thy timely mandate, I deferred 
The task, in smoother walks to stray; 
But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may. 
 
Through no disturbance of my soul, 
Or strong compunction in me wrought, 
I supplicate for thy control; 
But in the quietness of thought: 
Me this unchartered freedom tires; 
I feel the weight of chance-desires: 
My hopes no more must change their name, 
I long for a repose that ever is the same. 
 
Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear 
The Godhead's most benignant grace; 
Nor know we anything so fair 
As is the smile upon thy face: 
Flowers laugh before thee on their beds 
And fragrance in thy footing treads; 
Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong; 
And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong. 
 
To humbler functions, awful Power! 
I call thee: I myself commend 
Unto thy guidance from this hour; 
Oh, let my weakness have an end! 
Give unto me, made lowly wise, 
The spirit of self-sacrifice; 
The confidence of reason give; 
And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live!",ode,types/modes,"['Ode', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45535/ode-to-duty,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,"The child is father of the man;
And I could wish my days to be
   Bound each to each by natural piety.
          (Wordsworth, ""My Heart Leaps Up"")

There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
       The earth, and every common sight,
                          To me did seem
                      Apparelled in celestial light,
            The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
                      Turn wheresoe'er I may,
                          By night or day.
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

                      The Rainbow comes and goes,
                      And lovely is the Rose,
                      The Moon doth with delight
       Look round her when the heavens are bare,
                      Waters on a starry night
                      Are beautiful and fair;
       The sunshine is a glorious birth;
       But yet I know, where'er I go,
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.

Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
       And while the young lambs bound
                      As to the tabor's sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
                      And I again am strong:
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
       The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
                      And all the earth is gay;
                           Land and sea
                Give themselves up to jollity,
                      And with the heart of May
                 Doth every Beast keep holiday;—
                      Thou Child of Joy,
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy.

Ye blessèd creatures, I have heard the call
      Ye to each other make; I see
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
      My heart is at your festival,
            My head hath its coronal,
The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.
                      Oh evil day! if I were sullen
                      While Earth herself is adorning,
                         This sweet May-morning,
                      And the Children are culling
                         On every side,
In a thousand valleys far and wide,
                      Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:—
                      I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
                      —But there's a Tree, of many, one,
A single field which I have looked upon,
Both of them speak of something that is gone;
                      The Pansy at my feet
                      Doth the same tale repeat:
Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
                      Hath had elsewhere its setting,
                         And cometh from afar:
                      Not in entire forgetfulness,
                      And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
                      From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
                      Upon the growing Boy,
But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
                      He sees it in his joy;
The Youth, who daily farther from the east
                      Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
                      And by the vision splendid
                      Is on his way attended;
At length the Man perceives it die away,
And fade into the light of common day.

Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
                      And, even with something of a Mother's mind,
                      And no unworthy aim,
The homely Nurse doth all she can
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,
                      Forget the glories he hath known,
And that imperial palace whence he came.

Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
A six years' Darling of a pigmy size!
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,
With light upon him from his father's eyes!
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
Some fragment from his dream of human life,
Shaped by himself with newly-learn{e}d art
                      A wedding or a festival,
                      A mourning or a funeral;
                         And this hath now his heart,
                      And unto this he frames his song:
                         Then will he fit his tongue
To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
                      But it will not be long
                      Ere this be thrown aside,
                      And with new joy and pride
The little Actor cons another part;
Filling from time to time his ""humorous stage""
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
That Life brings with her in her equipage;
                      As if his whole vocation
                      Were endless imitation.

Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
                      Thy Soul's immensity;
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,—
                      Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!
                      On whom those truths do rest,
Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
Thou, over whom thy Immortality
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave,
A Presence which is not to be put by;
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height,
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,
And custom lie upon thee with a weight,
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!

                      O joy! that in our embers
                      Is something that doth live,
                      That Nature yet remembers
What was so fugitive!
The thought of our past years in me doth breed
Perpetual benediction: not indeed
For that which is most worthy to be blest;
Delight and liberty, the simple creed
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:—
                      Not for these I raise
                      The song of thanks and praise
                But for those obstinate questionings
                Of sense and outward things,
                Fallings from us, vanishings;
                Blank misgivings of a Creature
Moving about in worlds not realised,
High instincts before which our mortal Nature
Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
                      But for those first affections,
                      Those shadowy recollections,
                Which, be they what they may
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
                Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
Our noisy years seem moments in the being
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
                To perish never;
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
                      Nor Man nor Boy,
Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
Can utterly abolish or destroy!
                Hence in a season of calm weather
                      Though inland far we be,
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
                      Which brought us hither,
                Can in a moment travel thither,
And see the Children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.

Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
                      And let the young Lambs bound
                      As to the tabor's sound!
We in thought will join your throng,
                      Ye that pipe and ye that play,
                      Ye that through your hearts to-day
                      Feel the gladness of the May!
What though the radiance which was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
                Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
                      We will grieve not, rather find
                      Strength in what remains behind;
                      In the primal sympathy
                      Which having been must ever be;
                      In the soothing thoughts that spring
                      Out of human suffering;
                      In the faith that looks through death,
In years that bring the philosophic mind.
And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,
Forebode not any severing of our loves!
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
I only have relinquished one delight
To live beneath your more habitual sway.
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret,
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
                      Is lovely yet;
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
Do take a sober colouring from an eye
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
To me the meanest flower that blows can give
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.",ode,types/modes,"['Living', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Philosophy', 'Ode']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45536/ode-intimations-of-immortality-from-recollections-of-early-childhood,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Related Audio', 'Related Video', 'Living', 'The Mind', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Pastoral']",n/a,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45521/i-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg,"When first, descending from the moorlands,
I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide
Along a bare and open valley,
The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide.

When last along its banks I wandered,
Through groves that had begun to shed
Their golden leaves upon the pathways,
My steps the Border-minstrel led.

The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,
'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
And death upon the braes of Yarrow,
Has closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes:

Nor has the rolling year twice measured,
From sign to sign, its stedfast course,
Since every mortal power of Coleridge
Was frozen at its marvellous source;

The rapt One, of the godlike forehead,
The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:
And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,
Has vanished from his lonely hearth.

Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,
Or waves that own no curbing hand,
How fast has brother followed brother,
From sunshine to the sunless land!

Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber
Were earlier raised, remain to hear
A timid voice, that asks in whispers,
""Who next will drop and disappear?""

Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,
Like London with its own black wreath,
On which with thee, O Crabbe! forth-looking,
I gazed from Hampstead's breezy heath.

As if but yesterday departed,
Thou too art gone before; but why,
O'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,
Should frail survivors heave a sigh?

Mourn rather for that holy Spirit,
Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;
For Her who, ere her summer faded,
Has sunk into a breathless sleep.

No more of old romantic sorrows,
For slaughtered Youth or love-lorn Maid!
With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten,
And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45517/extempore-effusion-upon-the-death-of-james-hogg,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,"Elegiac Stanzas Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm, Painted by Sir George Beaumont","I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile! 
Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee: 
I saw thee every day; and all the while 
Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea. 
 
So pure the sky, so quiet was the air! 
So like, so very like, was day to day! 
Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there; 
It trembled, but it never passed away. 
 
How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep; 
No mood, which season takes away, or brings: 
I could have fancied that the mighty Deep 
Was even the gentlest of all gentle things. 
 
Ah!  then , if mine had been the Painter's hand, 
To express what then I saw; and add the gleam, 
The light that never was, on sea or land, 
The consecration, and the Poet's dream; 
 
I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile 
Amid a world how different from this! 
Beside a sea that could not cease to smile; 
On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss. 
 
Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine 
Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;— 
Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine 
The very sweetest had to thee been given. 
 
A Picture had it been of lasting ease, 
Elysian quiet, without toil or strife; 
No motion but the moving tide, a breeze, 
Or merely silent Nature's breathing life. 
 
Such, in the fond illusion of my heart, 
Such Picture would I at that time have made: 
And seen the soul of truth in every part, 
A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed. 
 
So once it would have been,—'tis so no more; 
I have submitted to a new control: 
A power is gone, which nothing can restore; 
A deep distress hath humanised my Soul. 
 
Not for a moment could I now behold 
A smiling sea, and be what I have been: 
The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old; 
This, which I know, I speak with mind serene. 
 
Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend, 
If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore, 
This work of thine I blame not, but commend; 
This sea in anger, and that dismal shore. 
 
O 'tis a passionate Work!—yet wise and well, 
Well chosen is the spirit that is here; 
That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell, 
This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear! 
 
And this huge Castle, standing here sublime, 
I love to see the look with which it braves, 
Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time, 
The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves. 
 
Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, 
Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind! 
Such happiness, wherever it be known, 
Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind. 
 
But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer, 
And frequent sights of what is to be borne! 
Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.—

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,"Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour. July 13, 1798","Five years have past; five summers, with the length
Of five long winters! and again I hear
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
With a soft inland murmur.—Once again
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
That on a wild secluded scene impress
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
The day is come when I again repose
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
With some uncertain notice, as might seem
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone.

                                              These beauteous forms,
Through a long absence, have not been to me
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;
And passing even into my purer mind
With tranquil restoration:—feelings too
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,
As have no slight or trivial influence
On that best portion of a good man's life,
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
To them I may have owed another gift,
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,—
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul:
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.

                                                        If this
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft—
In darkness and amid the many shapes
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart—
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,
         How often has my spirit turned to thee!

   And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,
With many recognitions dim and faint,
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
The picture of the mind revives again:
While here I stand, not only with the sense
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts
That in this moment there is life and food
For future years. And so I dare to hope,
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first
I came among these hills; when like a roe
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
Wherever nature led: more like a man
Flying from something that he dreads, than one
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days
And their glad animal movements all gone by)
To me was all in all.—I cannot paint
What then I was. The sounding cataract
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to me
An appetite; a feeling and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, nor any interest
Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past,
And all its aching joys are now no more,
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,
Abundant recompense. For I have learned
To look on nature, not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue.—And I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
And the round ocean and the living air,
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:
A motion and a spirit, that impels
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
A lover of the meadows and the woods
And mountains; and of all that we behold
From this green earth; of all the mighty world
Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create,
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise
In nature and the language of the sense
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
Of all my moral being.

                                            Nor perchance,
If I were not thus taught, should I the more
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:
For thou art with me here upon the banks
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch
The language of my former heart, and read
My former pleasures in the shooting lights
Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while
May I behold in thee what I was once,
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,
Knowing that Nature never did betray
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,
Through all the years of this our life, to lead
From joy to joy: for she can so inform
The mind that is within us, so impress
With quietness and beauty, and so feed
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
The dreary intercourse of daily life,
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
And let the misty mountain-winds be free
To blow against thee: and, in after years,
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance—
If I should be where I no more can hear
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams
Of past existence—wilt thou then forget
That on the banks of this delightful stream
We stood together; and that I, so long
A worshipper of Nature, hither came
Unwearied in that service: rather say
With warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,
That after many wanderings, many years
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,There was a Boy,"There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs
And islands of Winander! many a time,
At evening, when the earliest stars began
To move along the edges of the hills,
Rising or setting, would he stand alone,
Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls
That they might answer him.—And they would shout
Across the watery vale, and shout again,
Responsive to his call,—with quivering peals,
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud
Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause
Of silence such as baffled his best skill:
Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
Has carried far into his heart the voice
Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
Would enter unawares into his mind
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received
Into the bosom of the steady lake.

     This boy was taken from his mates, and died
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs
Upon a slope above the village-school;
And through that churchyard when my way has led
On summer-evenings, I believe that there

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,The French Revolution as It Appeared to Enthusiasts at Its Commencement,"Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy! 
For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood 
Upon our side, we who were strong in love! 
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, 
But to be young was very heaven!—Oh! times, 
In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways 
Of custom, law, and statute, took at once 
The attraction of a country in romance! 
When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights, 
When most intent on making of herself 
A prime Enchantress—to assist the work 
Which then was going forward in her name! 
Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth, 
The beauty wore of promise, that which sets 
(As at some moment might not be unfelt 
Among the bowers of paradise itself ) 
The budding rose above the rose full blown. 
What temper at the prospect did not wake 
To happiness unthought of? The inert 
Were roused, and lively natures rapt away! 
They who had fed their childhood upon dreams, 
The playfellows of fancy, who had made 
All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength 
Their ministers,—who in lordly wise had stirred 
Among the grandest objects of the sense, 
And dealt with whatsoever they found there 
As if they had within some lurking right 
To wield it;—they, too, who, of gentle mood, 
Had watched all gentle motions, and to these 
Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more wild, 
And in the region of their peaceful selves;— 
Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty 
Did both find, helpers to their heart's desire, 
And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish; 
Were called upon to exercise their skill,

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Influence of Natural Objects in Calling Forth and Strengthening the Imagination in Boyhood and Early Youth,"Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought!
And giv'st to forms and images a breath
And everlasting motion! not in vain,
By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn
Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
The passions that build up our human soul;
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man;
But with high objects, with enduring things,
With life and nature; purifying thus
The elements of feeling and of thought,
And sanctifying by such discipline
Both pain and fear,—until we recognise
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.

     Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
With stinted kindness. In November days,
When vapours rolling down the valleys made
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
At noon; and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
When, by the margin of the trembling lake,
Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went
In solitude, such intercourse was mine:
Mine was it in the fields both day and night,
And by the waters, all the summer long.
And in the frosty season, when the sun
Was set, and, visible for many a mile,
The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed,
I heeded not the summons: happy time
It was indeed for all of us; for me
It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud
The village-clock tolled six—I wheeled about,
Proud and exulting like an untired horse
That cares not for his home.—All shod with steel
We hissed along the polished ice, in games
Confederate, imitative of the chase
And woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn,
The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare.
So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
And not a voice was idle; with the din
Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;
The leafless trees and every icy crag
Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills
Into the tumult sent an alien sound
Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars,
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
The orange sky of evening died away.

     Not seldom from the uproar I retired
Into a silent bay, or sportively
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
To cut across the reflex of a star;
Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed
Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes,
When we had given our bodies to the wind,
And all the shadowy banks on either side
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
The rapid line of motion, then at once
Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
Wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled
With visible motion her diurnal round!

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,The Simplon Pass,"—Brook and road
Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy Pass,
And with them did we journey several hours
At a slow step. The immeasurable height
Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,
The stationary blasts of waterfalls,
And in the narrow rent, at every turn,
Winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn,
The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,
The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,
Black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside
As if a voice were in them, the sick sight
And giddy prospect of the raving stream,
The unfettered clouds and region of the heavens,
Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light—
Were all like workings of one mind, the features
Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree,

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,from The Prelude: Book 1: Childhood and School-time,"—Was it for this
That one, the fairest of all Rivers, lov'd
To blend his murmurs with my Nurse's song,
And from his alder shades and rocky falls,
And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice
That flow'd along my dreams? For this, didst Thou,
O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains
Near my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous Stream
Make ceaseless music through the night and day
Which with its steady cadence, tempering
Our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts
To more than infant softness, giving me,
Among the fretful dwellings of mankind,
A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm
That Nature breathes among the hills and groves.
When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers
Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came,
Behind my Father's House he pass'd, close by,
Along the margin of our Terrace Walk.
He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd.
Oh! many a time have I, a five years' Child,
A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill,
A little Mill-race sever'd from his stream,
Made one long bathing of a summer's day,
Bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again
Alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd
Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves
Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,
The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
Were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone
Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
On Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut
Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport,
A naked Savage, in the thunder shower.

       Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up
Foster'd alike by beauty and by fear;
Much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less
In that beloved Vale to which, erelong,
I was transplanted. Well I call to mind
('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen
Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope
The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd
The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy
To wander half the night among the Cliffs
And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran
Along the open turf. In thought and wish
That time, my shoulder all with springes hung,
I was a fell destroyer. On the heights
Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied
My anxious visitation, hurrying on,
Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars
Were shining o'er my head; I was alone,
And seem'd to be a trouble to the peace
That was among them. Sometimes it befel
In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire
O'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird
Which was the captive of another's toils
Became my prey; and, when the deed was done
I heard among the solitary hills
Low breathings coming after me, and sounds
Of undistinguishable motion, steps
Almost as silent as the turf they trod.
Nor less in springtime when on southern banks
The shining sun had from his knot of leaves
Decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales
And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then
In the high places, on the lonesome peaks
Where'er, among the mountains and the winds,
The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean
My object, and inglorious, yet the end
Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung
Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass
And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
But ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd,
Suspended by the blast which blew amain,
Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time,
While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,
With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
Blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky
Of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!

       The mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath
And harmony of music. There is a dark
Invisible workmanship that reconciles
Discordant elements, and makes them move
In one society. Ah me! that all
The terrors, all the early miseries
Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all
The thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd
Into my mind, should ever have made up
The calm existence that is mine when I
Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!
Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe
That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame
A favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn
Of infancy doth open out the clouds,
As at the touch of lightning, seeking him
With gentlest visitation; not the less,
Though haply aiming at the self-same end,
Does it delight her sometimes to employ
Severer interventions, ministry
More palpable, and so she dealt with me.

       One evening (surely I was led by her)
I went alone into a Shepherd's Boat,
A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied
Within a rocky Cave, its usual home.
'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale
Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come
A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays.
Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone
No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff,
Discover'd thus by unexpected chance,
Than I unloos'd her tether and embark'd.
The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear
Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore
I push'd, and struck the oars and struck again
In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on
Even like a Man who walks with stately step
Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth
And troubled pleasure; not without the voice
Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on,
Leaving behind her still on either side
Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
Until they melted all into one track
Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose
Above the Cavern of the Willow tree
And now, as suited one who proudly row'd
With his best skill, I fix'd a steady view
Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,
The bound of the horizon, for behind
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily
I dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake,
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat
Went heaving through the water, like a Swan;
When from behind that craggy Steep, till then
The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff,
As if with voluntary power instinct,
Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again
And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff
Rose up between me and the stars, and still,
With measur'd motion, like a living thing,
Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd,
And through the silent water stole my way
Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree.
There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark,
And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave
And serious thoughts; and after I had seen
That spectacle, for many days, my brain
Work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense
Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts
There was a darkness, call it solitude,
Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes
Of hourly objects, images of trees,
Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
But huge and mighty Forms that do not live
Like living men mov'd slowly through the mind
By day and were the trouble of my dreams.

       Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought!
That giv'st to forms and images a breath
And everlasting motion! not in vain,
By day or star-light thus from my first dawn
Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me
The passions that build up our human Soul,
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man,
But with high objects, with enduring things,
With life and nature, purifying thus
The elements of feeling and of thought,
And sanctifying, by such discipline,
Both pain and fear, until we recognize
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.

       Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me
With stinted kindness. In November days,
When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
When, by the margin of the trembling Lake,
Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went
In solitude, such intercourse was mine;
'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,
And by the waters all the summer long.

       And in the frosty season, when the sun
Was set, and visible for many a mile
The cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd,
I heeded not the summons:—happy time
It was, indeed, for all of us; to me
It was a time of rapture: clear and loud
The village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about,
Proud and exulting, like an untired horse,
That cares not for its home.—All shod with steel,
We hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games
Confederate, imitative of the chace
And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,
The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.
So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
And not a voice was idle; with the din,
Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,
The leafless trees, and every icy crag
Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills
Into the tumult sent an alien sound
Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
The orange sky of evening died away.

       Not seldom from the uproar I retired
Into a silent bay, or sportively
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
To cut across the image of a star
That gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes
When we had given our bodies to the wind,
And all the shadowy banks, on either side,
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
The rapid line of motion; then at once
Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
Stopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs
Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd
With visible motion her diurnal round;
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd
Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.

       Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky
And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!
And Souls of lonely places! can I think
A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd
Such ministry, when Ye through many a year
Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,
On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,
Impress'd upon all forms the characters
Of danger or desire, and thus did make
The surface of the universal earth
With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,
Work like a sea?

                                          Not uselessly employ'd,
I might pursue this theme through every change
Of exercise and play, to which the year
Did summon us in its delightful round.

       We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven
Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours,
Nor saw a race in happiness and joy
More worthy of the ground where they were sown.
I would record with no reluctant voice
The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers
With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,
True symbol of the foolishness of hope,
Which with its strong enchantment led us on
By rocks and pools, shut out from every star
All the green summer, to forlorn cascades
Among the windings of the mountain brooks.
—Unfading recollections! at this hour
The heart is almost mine with which I felt
From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons
The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds
Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser,
Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,
Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly
Dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm.

       Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt,
A ministration of your own was yours,
A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!
Can I forget you, being as ye were
So beautiful among the pleasant fields
In which ye stood? Or can I here forget
The plain and seemly countenance with which
Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye
Delights and exultations of your own.
Eager and never weary we pursued
Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire
At evening; when with pencil and with slate,
In square divisions parcell'd out, and all
With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,
We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head
In strife too humble to be named in Verse.
Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,
Cherry or maple, sate in close array,
And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on
thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world
Neglected and ungratefully thrown by
Even for the very service they had wrought,
But husbanded through many a long campaign.
Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few
Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,
Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth
Had glorified, and call'd to represent
The persons of departed Potentates.
Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell!
Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades,
A congregation piteously akin.
Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit,
Those sooty knaves, precipitated down
With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven,
The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse,
Queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay,
And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd
By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad
The heavy rain was falling, or the frost
Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,
And, interrupting oft the impassion'd game,
From Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice,
While it sank down towards the water, sent,
Among the meadows and the hills, its long
And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves
When they are howling round the Bothnic Main.

       Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace
How Nature by extrinsic passion first
Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,
And made me love them, may I well forget
How other pleasures have been mine, and joys
Of subtler origin; how I have felt,
Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time,
Those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense
Which seem, in their simplicity, to own
An intellectual charm, that calm delight
Which, if I err not, surely must belong
To those first-born affinities that fit
Our new existence to existing things,
And, in our dawn of being, constitute
The bond of union betwixt life and joy.

       Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth,
And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd
The faces of the moving year, even then,
A Child, I held unconscious intercourse
With the eternal Beauty, drinking in
A pure organic pleasure from the lines
Of curling mist, or from the level plain
Of waters colour'd by the steady clouds.

       The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays
Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell
How when the Sea threw off his evening shade
And to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags
Did send sweet notice of the rising moon,
How I have stood, to fancies such as these,
Engrafted in the tenderness of thought,
A stranger, linking with the spectacle
No conscious memory of a kindred sight,
And bringing with me no peculiar sense
Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood,
Even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues
Of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd,
Through every hair-breadth of that field of light,
New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.

       Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy
Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits
Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss
Which, like a tempest, works along the blood
And is forgotten; even then I felt
Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth
And common face of Nature spake to me
Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,
By chance collisions and quaint accidents
Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd
Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain
Nor profitless, if haply they impress'd
Collateral objects and appearances,
Albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep
Until maturer seasons call'd them forth
To impregnate and to elevate the mind.
—And if the vulgar joy by its own weight
Wearied itself out of the memory,
The scenes which were a witness of that joy
Remained, in their substantial lineaments
Depicted on the brain, and to the eye
Were visible, a daily sight; and thus
By the impressive discipline of fear,
By pleasure and repeated happiness,
So frequently repeated, and by force
Of obscure feelings representative
Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,
So beauteous and majestic in themselves,
Though yet the day was distant, did at length
Become habitually dear, and all
Their hues and forms were by invisible links
Allied to the affections.

                                                       I began
My story early, feeling as I fear,
The weakness of a human love, for days
Disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring
Planting my snowdrops among winter snows.
Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt
In sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out,
With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale.
Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch
Invigorating thoughts from former years,
Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,
And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power
May spur me on, in manhood now mature,
To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes
Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught
To understand myself, nor thou to know
With better knowledge how the heart was fram'd
Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee
Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit
Those recollected hours that have the charm
Of visionary things, and lovely forms
And sweet sensations that throw back our life
And almost make our Infancy itself
A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?

       One end hereby at least hath been attain'd,
My mind hath been revived, and if this mood
Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down,
Through later years, the story of my life.
The road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,from The Prelude: Book 2: School-time (Continued),"Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much 
Unvisited, endeavour'd to retrace 
My life through its first years, and measured back 
The way I travell'd when I first began 
To love the woods and fields; the passion yet 
Was in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal, 
By nourishment that came unsought, for still, 
From week to week, from month to month, we liv'd 
A round of tumult: duly were our games 
Prolong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd; 
No chair remain'd before the doors, the bench 
And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep 
The Labourer, and the old Man who had sate, 
A later lingerer, yet the revelry 
Continued, and the loud uproar: at last, 
When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds 
Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went, 
With weary joints, and with a beating mind. 
Ah! is there one who ever has been young, 
Nor needs a monitory voice to tame 
The pride of virtue, and of intellect? 
And is there one, the wisest and the best 
Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish 
For things which cannot be, who would not give, 
If so he might, to duty and to truth 
The eagerness of infantine desire? 
A tranquillizing spirit presses now 
On my corporeal frame: so wide appears 
The vacancy between me and those days, 
Which yet have such self-presence in my mind 
That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem 
Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself 
And of some other Being. A grey Stone 
Of native rock, left midway in the Square 
Of our small market Village, was the home 
And centre of these joys, and when, return'd 
After long absence, thither I repair'd, 
I found that it was split, and gone to build 
A smart Assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd 
With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground 
Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream, 
And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know 
That more than one of you will think with me 
Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame 
From whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate 
And watch'd her Table with its huckster's wares 
Assiduous, thro' the length of sixty years. 
 
       We ran a boisterous race; the year span round 
With giddy motion. But the time approach'd 
That brought with it a regular desire 
For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms 
Of Nature were collaterally attach'd 
To every scheme of holiday delight, 
And every boyish sport, less grateful else, 
And languidly pursued. 
 
                                                       When summer came 
It was the pastime of our afternoons 
To beat along the plain of Windermere 
With rival oars, and the selected bourne 
Was now an Island musical with birds 
That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle 
Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown 
With lillies of the valley, like a field; 
And now a third small Island where remain'd 
An old stone Table, and a moulder'd Cave, 
A Hermit's history. In such a race, 
So ended, disappointment could be none, 
Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy: 
We rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike, 
Conquer'd and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength, 
And the vain-glory of superior skill 
Were interfus'd with objects which subdu'd 
And temper'd them, and gradually produc'd 
A quiet independence of the heart. 
And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add, 
Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence 
Ensu'd a diffidence and modesty, 
And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much, 
The self-sufficing power of solitude. 
 
       No delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength; 
More than we wish'd we knew the blessing then 
Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals 
Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude 
A little weekly stipend, and we lived 
Through three divisions of the quarter'd year 
In pennyless poverty. But now, to School 
Return'd, from the half-yearly holidays, 
We came with purses more profusely fill'd, 
Allowance which abundantly suffic'd 
To gratify the palate with repasts 
More costly than the Dame of whom I spake, 
That ancient Woman, and her board supplied. 
Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long 
Excursions far away among the hills, 
Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground, 
Or in the woods, or near a river side, 
Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs 
Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun 
Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy. 
 
       Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell 
How twice in the long length of those half-years 
We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand 
Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least, 
To feel the motion of the galloping Steed; 
And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth, 
On such occasion sometimes we employ'd 
Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound 
Of the day's journey was too distant far 
For any cautious man, a Structure famed 
Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls 
Of that large Abbey which within the vale 
Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built, 
Stands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch, 
Belfry, and Images, and living Trees, 
A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf 
Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace 
Left by the sea wind passing overhead 
(Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers 
May in that Valley oftentimes be seen, 
Both silent and both motionless alike; 
Such is the shelter that is there, and such 
The safeguard for repose and quietness. 
 
       Our steeds remounted, and the summons given, 
With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew 
In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd Knight, 
And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren 
Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave 
Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers 
The earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint 
Internal breezes, sobbings of the place, 
And respirations, from the roofless walls 
The shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still, 
So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible Bird 
Sang to itself, that there I could have made 
My dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there 
To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew 
And down the valley, and a circuit made 
In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth 
We scamper'd homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams, 
And that still Spirit of the evening air! 
Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt 
Your presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd 
Along the sides of the steep hills, or when, 
Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea, 
We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand. 
 
       Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere, 
Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay, 
There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed, 
Brother of the surrounding Cottages, 
But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset 
With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within 
Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine. 
In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built 
On the large Island, had this Dwelling been 
More worthy of a Poet's love, a Hut, 
Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade. 
But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed 
The threshold, and large golden characters 
On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp'd 
The place of the old Lion, in contempt 
And mockery of the rustic painter's hand, 
Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear 
With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay 
Upon a slope surmounted by the plain 
Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood 
A grove; with gleams of water through the trees 
And over the tree-tops; nor did we want 
Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream. 
And there, through half an afternoon, we play'd 
On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent 
Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall 
Of night, when in our pinnace we return'd 
Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach 
Of some small Island steer'd our course with one, 
The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there, 
And row'd off gently, while he blew his flute 
Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm 
And dead still water lay upon my mind 
Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky 
Never before so beautiful, sank down 
Into my heart, and held me like a dream. 
 
       Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged, 
And thus the common range of visible things 
Grew dear to me: already I began 
To love the sun, a Boy I lov'd the sun, 
Not as I since have lov'd him, as a pledge 
And surety of our earthly life, a light 
Which while we view we feel we are alive; 
But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay 
His beauty on the morning hills, had seen 
The western mountain touch his setting orb, 
In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess 
Of happiness, my blood appear'd to flow 
With its own pleasure, and I breath'd with joy. 
And from like feelings, humble though intense, 
To patriotic and domestic love 
Analogous, the moon to me was dear; 
For I would dream away my purposes, 
Standing to look upon her while she hung 
Midway between the hills, as if she knew 
No other region; but belong'd to thee, 
Yea, appertain'd by a peculiar right 
To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale! 
 
       Those incidental charms which first attach'd 
My heart to rural objects, day by day 
Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell 
How Nature, intervenient till this time, 
And secondary, now at length was sought 
For her own sake. But who shall parcel out 
His intellect, by geometric rules, 
Split, like a province, into round and square? 
Who knows the individual hour in which 
His habits were first sown, even as a seed, 
Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say, 
'This portion of the river of my mind 
Came from yon fountain?' Thou, my Friend! art one 
More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee 
Science appears but, what in truth she is, 
Not as our glory and our absolute boast, 
But as a succedaneum, and a prop 
To our infirmity. Thou art no slave 
Of that false secondary power, by which, 
In weakness, we create distinctions, then 
Deem that our puny boundaries are things 
Which we perceive, and not which we have made. 
To thee, unblinded by these outward shows, 
The unity of all has been reveal'd 
And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd 
Than many are to class the cabinet 
Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase, 
Run through the history and birth of each, 
As of a single independent thing. 
Hard task to analyse a soul, in which, 
Not only general habits and desires, 
But each most obvious and particular thought, 
Not in a mystical and idle sense, 
But in the words of reason deeply weigh'd, 
Hath no beginning. 
 
                                              Bless'd the infant Babe, 
(For with my best conjectures I would trace 
The progress of our Being) blest the Babe, 
Nurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps 
Upon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul 
Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul, 
Doth gather passion from his Mother's eye! 
Such feelings pass into his torpid life 
Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind 
Even [in the first trial of its powers] 
Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine 
In one appearance, all the elements 
And parts of the same object, else detach'd 
And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day, 
Subjected to the discipline of love, 
His organs and recipient faculties 
Are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads, 
Tenacious of the forms which it receives. 
In one beloved presence, nay and more, 
In that most apprehensive habitude 
And those sensations which have been deriv'd 
From this beloved Presence, there exists 
A virtue which irradiates and exalts 
All objects through all intercourse of sense. 
No outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd; 
Along his infant veins are interfus'd 
The gravitation and the filial bond 
Of nature, that connect him with the world. 
Emphatically such a Being lives, 
An inmate of this  active universe; 
From nature largely he receives; nor so 
Is satisfied, but largely gives again, 
For feeling has to him imparted strength, 
And powerful in all sentiments of grief, 
Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind, 
Even as an agent of the one great mind, 
Creates, creator and receiver both, 
Working but in alliance with the works 
Which it beholds.—Such, verily, is the first 
Poetic spirit of our human life; 
By uniform control of after years 
In most abated or suppress'd, in some, 
Through every change of growth or of decay, 
Pre-eminent till death. 
 
                                                    From early days, 
Beginning not long after that first time 
In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch, 
I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart 
I have endeavour'd to display the means 
Whereby this infant sensibility, 
Great birthright of our Being, was in me 
Augmented and sustain'd. Yet is a path 
More difficult before me, and I fear 
That in its broken windings we shall need 
The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing: 
For now a trouble came into my mind 
From unknown causes. I was left alone, 
Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why. 
The props of my affections were remov'd, 
And yet the building stood, as if sustain'd 
By its own spirit! All that I beheld 
Was dear to me, and from this cause it came, 
That now to Nature's finer influxes 
My mind lay open, to that more exact 
And intimate communion which our hearts 
Maintain with the minuter properties 
Of objects which already are belov'd, 
And of those only. Many are the joys 
Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live 
When every hour brings palpable access 
Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight, 
And sorrow is not there. The seasons came, 
And every season to my notice brought 
A store of transitory qualities 
Which, but for this most watchful power of love 
Had been neglected, left a register 
Of permanent relations, else unknown, 
Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude 
More active, even, than 'best society', 
Society made sweet as solitude 
By silent inobtrusive sympathies, 
And gentle agitations of the mind 
From manifold distinctions, difference 
Perceived in things, where to the common eye, 
No difference is; and hence, from the same source 
Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone, 
In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights 
Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time, 
Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound 
To breathe an elevated mood, by form 
Or image unprofaned; and I would stand, 
Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are 
The ghostly language of the ancient earth, 
Or make their dim abode in distant winds. 
Thence did I drink the visionary power. 
I deem not profitless those fleeting moods 
Of shadowy exultation: not for this, 
That they are kindred to our purer mind 
And intellectual life; but that the soul, 
Remembering how she felt, but what she felt 
Remembering not, retains an obscure sense 
Of possible sublimity, to which, 
With growing faculties she doth aspire, 
With faculties still growing, feeling still 
That whatsoever point they gain, they still 
Have something to pursue. 
 
                                                             And not alone, 
In grandeur and in tumult, but no less 
In tranquil scenes, that universal power 
And fitness in the latent qualities 
And essences of things, by which the mind 
Is mov'd by feelings of delight, to me 
Came strengthen'd with a superadded soul, 
A virtue not its own. My morning walks 
Were early; oft, before the hours of School 
I travell'd round our little Lake, five miles 
Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear 
For this, that one was by my side, a Friend 
Then passionately lov'd; with heart how full 
Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps 
A blank to other men! for many years 
Have since flow'd in between us; and our minds, 
Both silent to each other, at this time 
We live as if those hours had never been. 
Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch 
Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush 
Was audible, among the hills I sate 
Alone, upon some jutting eminence 
At the first hour of morning, when the Vale 
Lay quiet in an utter solitude. 
How shall I trace the history, where seek 
The origin of what I then have felt? 
Oft in these moments such a holy calm 
Did overspread my soul, that I forgot 
That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw 
Appear'd like something in myself, a dream, 
A prospect in my mind. 
 
                                                       'Twere long to tell 
What spring and autumn, what the winter snows, 
And what the summer shade, what day and night, 
The evening and the morning, what my dreams 
And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse 
That spirit of religious love in which 
I walked with Nature. But let this, at least 
Be not forgotten, that I still retain'd 
My first creative sensibility, 
That by the regular action of the world 
My soul was unsubdu'd. A plastic power 
Abode with me, a forming hand, at times 
Rebellious, acting in a devious mood, 
A local spirit of its own, at war 
With general tendency, but for the most 
Subservient strictly to the external things 
With which it commun'd. An auxiliar light 
Came from my mind which on the setting sun 
Bestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds, 
The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on, 
Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd 
A like dominion; and the midnight storm 
Grew darker in the presence of my eye. 
Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence, 
And hence my transport. 
 
                                                          Nor should this, perchance, 
Pass unrecorded, that I still have lov'd 
The exercise and produce of a toil 
Than analytic industry to me 
More pleasing, and whose character I deem 
Is more poetic as resembling more 
Creative agency. I mean to speak 
Of that interminable building rear'd 
By observation of affinities 
In objects where no brotherhood exists 
To common minds. My seventeenth year was come 
And, whether from this habit, rooted now 
So deeply in my mind, or from excess 
Of the great social principle of life, 
Coercing all things into sympathy, 
To unorganic natures I transferr'd 
My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth 
Coming in revelation, I convers'd 
With things that really are, I, at this time 
Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. 
Thus did my days pass on, and now at length 
From Nature and her overflowing soul 
I had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts 
Were steep'd in feeling; I was only then 
Contented when with bliss ineffable 
I felt the sentiment of Being spread 
O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still, 
O'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought 
And human knowledge, to the human eye 
Invisible, yet liveth to the heart, 
O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings, 
Or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides 
Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself 
And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not 
If such my transports were; for in all things 
I saw one life, and felt that it was joy. 
One song they sang, and it was audible, 
Most audible then when the fleshly ear, 
O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain, 
Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd. 
 
       If this be error, and another faith 
Find easier access to the pious mind, 
Yet were I grossly destitute of all 
Those human sentiments which make this earth 
So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice 
To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes, 
And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds 
That dwell among the hills where I was born. 
If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart, 
If, mingling with the world, I am content 
With my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd, 
With God and Nature communing, remov'd 
From little enmities and low desires, 
The gift is yours; if in these times of fear, 
This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown, 
If, 'mid indifference and apathy 
And wicked exultation, when good men, 
On every side fall off we know not how, 
To selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names 
Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love, 
Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers 
On visionary minds; if in this time 
Of dereliction and dismay, I yet 
Despair not of our nature; but retain 
A more than Roman confidence, a faith 
That fails not, in all sorrow my support, 
The blessing of my life, the gift is yours, 
Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed 
My lofty speculations; and in thee, 
For this uneasy heart of ours I find 
A never-failing principle of joy, 
And purest passion. 
 
                                                Thou, my Friend! wert rear'd 
In the great City, 'mid far other scenes; 
But we, by different roads at length have gain'd 
The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee 
I speak, unapprehensive of contempt, 
The insinuated scoff of coward tongues, 
And all that silent language which so oft 
In conversation betwixt man and man 
Blots from the human countenance all trace 
Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought 
The truth in solitude, and Thou art one, 
The most intense of Nature's worshippers 
In many things my Brother, chiefly here 
In this my deep devotion. 
 
                                                            Fare Thee well! 
Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind 
Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men, 
And yet more often living with Thyself, 
And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days 
Be many, and a blessing to mankind.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Coming of Age', 'Activities', 'School & Learning', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Philosophy', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45543/the-prelude-book-2-school-time-continued,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,To the Cuckoo,"O blithe New-comer! I have heard,
I hear thee and rejoice.
O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird,
Or but a wandering Voice?

While I am lying on the grass
Thy twofold shout I hear;
From hill to hill it seems to pass,
At once far off, and near.

Though babbling only to the Vale
Of sunshine and of flowers,
Thou bringest unto me a tale
Of visionary hours.

Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!
Even yet thou art to me
No bird, but an invisible thing,
A voice, a mystery;

The same whom in my school-boy days
I listened to; that Cry
Which made me look a thousand ways
In bush, and tree, and sky.

To seek thee did I often rove
Through woods and on the green;
And thou wert still a hope, a love;
Still longed for, never seen.

And I can listen to thee yet;
Can lie upon the plain
And listen, till I do beget
That golden time again.

O blessèd Bird! the earth we pace

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Yarrow Unvisited,"From Stirling castle we had seen
The mazy Forth unravelled;
Had trod the banks of Clyde, and Tay,
And with the Tweed had travelled;
And when we came to Clovenford,
Then said my ""winsome Marrow ,""
""Whate'er betide, we'll turn aside,
And see the Braes of Yarrow.""
""Let Yarrow folk, frae Selkirk town,
Who have been buying, selling,
Go back to Yarrow, 'tis their own;
Each maiden to her dwelling!
On Yarrow's banks let her herons feed,
Hares couch, and rabbits burrow!
But we will downward with the Tweed
Nor turn aside to Yarrow.
""There's Galla Water, Leader Haughs,
Both lying right before us;
And Dryborough, where with chiming Tweed
The lintwhites sing in chorus;
There's pleasant Tiviot-dale, a land
Made blithe with plough and harrow:
Why throw away a needful day
To go in search of Yarrow?
""What's Yarrow but a river bare,
That glides the dark hills under?
There are a thousand such elsewhere
As worthy of your wonder.""
—Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn;
My True-love sighed for sorrow;
And looked me in the face, to think
I thus could speak of Yarrow!
""Oh! green,"" said I, ""are Yarrow's holms,
And sweet is Yarrow flowing!
Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,
But we will leave it growing.
O'er hilly path, and open Strath,
We'll wander Scotland thorough;
But, though so near, we will not turn
Into the dale of Yarrow.
""Let beeves and home-bred kine partake
The sweets of Burn-mill meadow,
The swan on still St. Mary's Lake
Float double, swan and shadow!
We will not see them; will not go,
To-day, nor yet to-morrow;
Enough if in our hearts we know
There's such a place as Yarrow.
""Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!
It must, or we shall rue it:
We have a vision of our own;
Ah! why should we undo it?
The treasured dreams of times long past,
We'll keep them, winsome Marrow!
For when we'er there, although 'tis fair,
'Twill be another Yarrow!
""If Care with freezing years should come,
And wandering seem but folly,—
Should we be loth to stir from home,
And yet be melancholy;
Should life be dull, and spirits low,
'Twill soothe us in our sorrow,

William Wordsworth,1770–1850,"Yarrow Visited. September, 1814","And is this—Yarrow?—This the stream
Of which my fancy cherished,
So faithfully, a waking dream?
An image that hath perished!
O that some Minstrel's harp were near,
To utter notes of gladness,
And chase this silence from the air,
That fills my heart with sadness!

Yet why?—a silvery current flows
With uncontrolled meanderings;
Nor have these eyes by greener hills
Been soothed, in all my wanderings.
And, through her depths, Saint Mary's Lake
Is visibly delighted;
For not a feature of those hills
Is in the mirror slighted.

A blue sky bends o'er Yarrow vale,
Save where that pearly whiteness
Is round the rising sun diffused,
A tender hazy brightness;
Mild dawn of promise! that excludes
All profitless dejection;
Though not unwilling here to admit
A pensive recollection.

Where was it that the famous Flower
Of Yarrow Vale lay bleeding?
His bed perchance was yon smooth mound
On which the herd is feeding:
And haply from this crystal pool,
Now peaceful as the morning,
The Water-wraith ascended thrice—
And gave his doleful warning.

Delicious is the Lay that sings
The haunts of happy Lovers,
The path that leads them to the grove,
The leafy grove that covers:
And Pity sanctifies the Verse
That paints, by strength of sorrow,
The unconquerable strength of love;
Bear witness, rueful Yarrow!

But thou, that didst appear so fair
To fond imagination,
Dost rival in the light of day
Her delicate creation:
Meek loveliness is round thee spread,
A softness still and holy;
The grace of forest charms decayed,
And pastoral melancholy.

That region left, the vale unfolds
Rich groves of lofty stature,
With Yarrow winding through the pomp
Of cultivated nature;
And, rising from those lofty groves,
Behold a Ruin hoary!
The shattered front of Newark's Towers,
Renowned in Border story.

Fair scenes for childhood's opening bloom,
For sportive youth to stray in;
For manhood to enjoy his strength;
And age to wear away in!
Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,
A covert for protection
Of tender thoughts, that nestle there—
The brood of chaste affection.

How sweet, on this autumnal day,
The wild-wood fruits to gather,
And on my True-love's forehead plant
A crest of blooming heather!
And what if I enwreathed my own!
'Twere no offence to reason;
The sober Hills thus deck their brows
To meet the wintry season.

I see—but not by sight alone,
Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;
A ray of fancy still survives—
Her sunshine plays upon thee!
Thy ever-youthful waters keep
A course of lively pleasure;
And gladsome notes my lips can breathe,
Accordant to the measure.

The vapours linger round the Heights,
They melt, and soon must vanish;
One hour is theirs, nor more is mine—
Sad thought, which I would banish,
But that I know, where'er I go,
Thy genuine image, Yarrow!
Will dwell with me—to heighten joy,
And cheer my mind in sorrow.",common measure,meters,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45567/yarrow-visited-september-1814,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
William Wordsworth,1770–1850,Yarrow Revisited,"The gallant Youth, who may have gained,
   Or seeks, a ""winsome Marrow,""
Was but an Infant in the lap
   When first I looked on Yarrow;
Once more, by Newark's Castle-gate
   Long left without a warder,
I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee,
   Great Minstrel of the Border!

Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,
   Their dignity installing
In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves
   Were on the bough, or falling;
But breezes played, and sunshine gleamed-
   The forest to embolden;
Reddened the fiery hues, and shot
   Transparence through the golden.

For busy thoughts the Stream flowed on
   In foamy agitation;
And slept in many a crystal pool
   For quiet contemplation:
No public and no private care
   The freeborn mind enthralling,
We made a day of happy hours,
   Our happy days recalling.

Brisk Youth appeared, the Morn of youth,
   With freaks of graceful folly,-
Life's temperate Noon, her sober Eve,
   Her Night not melancholy;
Past, present, future, all appeared
   In harmony united,
Like guests that meet, and some from far,
   By cordial love invited.

And if, as Yarrow, through the woods
   And down the meadow ranging,
Did meet us with unaltered face,
   Though we were changed and changing;
If, then, some natural shadows spread
   Our inward prospect over,
The soul's deep valley was not slow
   Its brightness to recover.

Eternal blessings on the Muse,
   And her divine employment!
The blameless Muse, who trains her Sons
   For hope and calm enjoyment;
Albeit sickness, lingering yet,
   Has o'er their pillow brooded;
And Care waylays their steps-a Sprite
   Not easily eluded.

For thee, O Scott! compelled to change
   Green Eildon-hill and Cheviot
For warm Vesuvio's vine-clad slopes;
   And leave thy Tweed and Tiviot
For mild Sorrento's breezy waves;
   May classic Fancy, linking
With native Fancy her fresh aid,
   Preserve thy heart from sinking!

Oh! while they minister to thee,
   Each vying with the other,
May Health return to mellow Age
   With Strength, her venturous brother;
And Tiber, and each brook and rill
   Renowned in song and story,
With unimagined beauty shine,
   Nor lose one ray of glory!

For Thou, upon a hundred streams,
   By tales of love and sorrow,
Of faithful love, undaunted truth
   Hast shed the power of Yarrow;
And streams unknown, hills yet unseen,
   Wherever they invite Thee,
At parent Nature's grateful call,
   With gladness must requite Thee.

A gracious welcome shall be thine,
   Such looks of love and honour
As thy own Yarrow gave to me
   When first I gazed upon her;
Beheld what I had feared to see,
   Unwilling to surrender
Dreams treasured up from early days,
   The holy and the tender.

And what, for this frail world, were all
   That mortals do or suffer,
Did no responsive harp, no pen,
   Memorial tribute offer?
Yea, what were mighty Nature's self?
   Her features, could they win us,
Unhelped by the poetic voice
   That hourly speaks within us?

Nor deem that localized Romance
   Plays false with our affections;
Unsanctifies our tears-made sport
   For fanciful dejections:
Ah, no! the visions of the past
   Sustain the heart in feeling
Life as she is-our changeful Life,
   With friends and kindred dealing.

Bear witness, Ye, whose thoughts that day
   In Yarrow's groves were centred;
Who through the silent portal arch
   Of mouldering Newark entered;
And clomb the winding stair that once
   Too timidly was mounted
By the ""last Minstrel,""(not the last!)
   Ere he his Tale recounted.

Flow on for ever, Yarrow Stream!
   Fulfil thy pensive duty,
Well pleased that future Bards should chant
   For simple hearts thy beauty;
To dream-light dear while yet unseen,
   Dear to the common sunshine,
And dearer still, as now I feel,
   To memory's shadowy moonshine!",common measure,meters,"['Living', 'Health & Illness', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Philosophy', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45566/yarrow-revisited,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth,,1770.0,1850.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Samuel Taylor Coleridge,1772–1834,The Pains of Sleep,"Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips or bended knees;
But silently, by slow degrees,
My spirit I to Love compose,
In humble trust mine eye-lids close,
With reverential resignation
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,
Only a sense of supplication;
A sense o'er all my soul imprest
That I am weak, yet not unblest,
Since in me, round me, every where
Eternal strength and Wisdom are.

But yester-night I prayed aloud
In anguish and in agony,
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me:
A lurid light, a trampling throng,
Sense of intolerable wrong,
And whom I scorned, those only strong!
Thirst of revenge, the powerless will
Still baffled, and yet burning still!
Desire with loathing strangely mixed
On wild or hateful objects fixed.
Fantastic passions! maddening brawl!
And shame and terror over all!
Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
Which all confused I could not know
Whether I suffered, or I did:
For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe,
My own or others still the same
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.

So two nights passed: the night's dismay
Saddened and stunned the coming day.
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me
Distemper's worst calamity.
The third night, when my own loud scream
Had waked me from the fiendish dream,
O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild,
I wept as I had been a child;
And having thus by tears subdued
My anguish to a milder mood,
Such punishments, I said, were due
To natures deepliest stained with sin,—
For aye entempesting anew
The unfathomable hell within,
The horror of their deeds to view,
To know and loathe, yet wish and do!
Such griefs with such men well agree,
But wherefore, wherefore fall on me?

And whom I love, I love indeed.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Religion', 'Faith & Doubt', 'Couplet', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Mixed']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43995/the-pains-of-sleep,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/samuel-taylor-coleridge,,1772.0,1834.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Call to the Hours, that in the distance play,

 Ye Clouds! that far above me float and pause,
   Whose pathless march no mortal may control!
   Ye Ocean-Waves! that, wheresoe'er ye roll,
Yield homage only to eternal laws!
Ye Woods! that listen to the night-birds singing,
   Midway the smooth and perilous slope reclined.
Save when your own imperious branches swinging,
   Have made a solemn music of the wind!
Where, like a man beloved of God,
Through glooms, which never woodman trod,
   How oft, pursuing fancies holy,
My moonlight way o'er flowering weeds I wound,
   Inspired, beyond the guess of folly,
By each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound!
O ye loud Waves! and O ye Forests high!
   And O ye Clouds that far above me soared!
Thou rising Sun! thou blue rejoicing Sky!
   Yea, every thing that is and will be free!
   Bear witness for me, wheresoe'er ye be,
   With what deep worship I have still adored
     The spirit of divinest Liberty.

II
 When France in wrath her giant-limbs upreared,
   And with that oath, which smote air, earth, and sea,
   Stamped her strong foot and said she would be free,
Bear witness for me, how I hoped and feared!
With what a joy my lofty gratulation
   Unawed I sang, amid a slavish band:
And when to whelm the disenchanted nation,
   Like fiends embattled by a wizard's wand,
     The Monarchs marched in evil day,
     And Britain joined the dire array;
   Though dear her shores and circling ocean,
Though many friendships, many youthful loves
   Had swoln the patriot emotion
And flung a magic light o'er all her hills and groves;
Yet still my voice, unaltered, sang defeat
   To all that braved the tyrant-quelling lance,
And shame too long delayed and vain retreat!
For ne'er, O Liberty! with partial aim
I dimmed thy light or damped thy holy flame;
   But blessed the paeans of delivered France,
And hung my head and wept at Britain's name.

III
 ""And what,"" I said, ""though Blasphemy's loud scream
   With that sweet music of deliverance strove!
   Though all the fierce and drunken passions wove
A dance more wild than e'er was maniac's dream!
   Ye storms, that round the dawning East assembled,
The Sun was rising, though ye hid his light!""
   And when, to soothe my soul, that hoped and trembled,
The dissonance ceased, and all seemed calm and bright;
   When France her front deep-scarr'd and gory
   Concealed with clustering wreaths of glory;
     When, insupportably advancing,
   Her arm made mockery of the warrior's ramp;
     While timid looks of fury glancing,
   Domestic treason, crushed beneath her fatal stamp,
Writhed like a wounded dragon in his gore;
   Then I reproached my fears that would not flee;
""And soon,"" I said, ""shall Wisdom teach her lore
In the low huts of them that toil and groan!
And, conquering by her happiness alone,
   Shall France compel the nations to be free,
Till Love and Joy look round, and call the Earth their own.""

IV
 Forgive me, Freedom! O forgive those dreams!
   I hear thy voice, I hear thy loud lament,
   From bleak Helvetia's icy caverns sent—
I hear thy groans upon her blood-stained streams!
   Heroes, that for your peaceful country perished,
And ye that, fleeing, spot your mountain-snows
   With bleeding wounds; forgive me, that I cherished
One thought that ever blessed your cruel foes!
   To scatter rage, and traitorous guilt,
   Where Peace her jealous home had built;
     A patriot-race to disinherit
Of all that made their stormy wilds so dear;
     And with inexpiable spirit
To taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer—
O France, that mockest Heaven, adulterous, blind,
   And patriot only in pernicious toils!
Are these thy boasts, Champion of human kind?

Yell in the hunt, and share the murderous prey;
To insult the shrine of Liberty with spoils
   From freemen torn; to tempt and to betray?

V
     The Sensual and the Dark rebel in vain,
   Slaves by their own compulsion! In mad game
   They burst their manacles and wear the name
     Of Freedom, graven on a heavier chain!
   O Liberty! with profitless endeavour
Have I pursued thee, many a weary hour;
   But thou nor swell'st the victor's strain, nor ever
Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power.
   Alike from all, howe'er they praise thee,
   (Nor prayer, nor boastful name delays thee)
     Alike from Priestcraft's harpy minions,
   And factious Blasphemy's obscener slaves,
     Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions,
The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves!
And there I felt thee!—on that sea-cliff's verge,
   Whose pines, scarce travelled by the breeze above,
Had made one murmur with the distant surge!
Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare,
And shot my being through earth, sea, and air,
   Possessing all things with intensest love,

Samuel Taylor Coleridge,1772–1834,Dejection: An Ode,"Late, late yestreen I saw the new Moon, 
With the old Moon in her arms; 
And I fear, I fear, my Master dear! 
We shall have a deadly storm. 
 (Ballad of Sir Patrick Spence) 


I 
Well! If the Bard was weather-wise, who made 
       The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence, 
       This night, so tranquil now, will not go hence 
Unroused by winds, that ply a busier trade 
Than those which mould yon cloud in lazy flakes, 
Or the dull sobbing draft, that moans and rakes 
Upon the strings of this Æolian lute, 
                Which better far were mute. 
         For lo! the New-moon winter-bright! 
         And overspread with phantom light, 
         (With swimming phantom light o'erspread 
         But rimmed and circled by a silver thread) 
I see the old Moon in her lap, foretelling 
         The coming-on of rain and squally blast. 
And oh! that even now the gust were swelling, 
         And the slant night-shower driving loud and fast! 
Those sounds which oft have raised me, whilst they awed, 
                And sent my soul abroad, 
Might now perhaps their wonted impulse give, 
Might startle this dull pain, and make it move and live! 
 
                            II 
A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear, 
         A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief, 
         Which finds no natural outlet, no relief, 
                In word, or sigh, or tear— 
O Lady! in this wan and heartless mood, 
To other thoughts by yonder throstle woo'd, 
         All this long eve, so balmy and serene, 
Have I been gazing on the western sky, 
         And its peculiar tint of yellow green: 
And still I gaze—and with how blank an eye! 
And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars, 
That give away their motion to the stars; 
Those stars, that glide behind them or between, 
Now sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen: 
Yon crescent Moon, as fixed as if it grew 
In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue; 
I see them all so excellently fair, 
I see, not feel, how beautiful they are! 
 
                            III 
                My genial spirits fail; 
                And what can these avail 
To lift the smothering weight from off my breast? 
                It were a vain endeavour, 
                Though I should gaze for ever 
On that green light that lingers in the west: 
I may not hope from outward forms to win 
The passion and the life, whose fountains are within. 
 
                            IV 
O Lady! we receive but what we give, 
And in our life alone does Nature live: 
Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud! 
         And would we aught behold, of higher worth, 
Than that inanimate cold world allowed 
To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd, 
         Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth 
A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud 
                Enveloping the Earth— 
And from the soul itself must there be sent 
         A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth, 
Of all sweet sounds the life and element! 
 
                              V 
O pure of heart! thou need'st not ask of me 
What this strong music in the soul may be! 
What, and wherein it doth exist, 
This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist, 
This beautiful and beauty-making power. 
         Joy, virtuous Lady! Joy that ne'er was given, 
Save to the pure, and in their purest hour, 
Life, and Life's effluence, cloud at once and shower, 
Joy, Lady! is the spirit and the power, 
Which wedding Nature to us gives in dower 
         A new Earth and new Heaven, 
Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud— 
Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud— 
                We in ourselves rejoice! 
And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight, 
         All melodies the echoes of that voice, 
All colours a suffusion from that light. 
 
                            VI 
There was a time when, though my path was rough, 
         This joy within me dallied with distress, 
And all misfortunes were but as the stuff 
         Whence Fancy made me dreams of happiness: 
For hope grew round me, like the twining vine, 
And fruits, and foliage, not my own, seemed mine. 
But now afflictions bow me down to earth: 
Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth; 
                But oh! each visitation 
Suspends what nature gave me at my birth, 
         My shaping spirit of Imagination. 
For not to think of what I needs must feel, 
         But to be still and patient, all I can; 
And haply by abstruse research to steal 
         From my own nature all the natural man— 
         This was my sole resource, my only plan: 
Till that which suits a part infects the whole, 
And now is almost grown the habit of my soul. 
 
                            VII 
Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind, 
                Reality's dark dream! 
I turn from you, and listen to the wind, 
         Which long has raved unnoticed. What a scream 
Of agony by torture lengthened out 
That lute sent forth! Thou Wind, that rav'st without, 
         Bare crag, or mountain-tairn, or blasted tree, 
Or pine-grove whither woodman never clomb, 
Or lonely house, long held the witches' home, 
         Methinks were fitter instruments for thee, 
Mad Lutanist! who in this month of showers, 
Of dark-brown gardens, and of peeping flowers, 
Mak'st Devils' yule, with worse than wintry song, 
The blossoms, buds, and timorous leaves among. 
         Thou Actor, perfect in all tragic sounds! 
Thou mighty Poet, e'en to frenzy bold! 
                What tell'st thou now about? 
                'Tis of the rushing of an host in rout, 
         With groans, of trampled men, with smarting wounds— 
At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold! 
But hush! there is a pause of deepest silence! 
         And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd, 
With groans, and tremulous shudderings—all is over— 
         It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud! 
                A tale of less affright, 
                And tempered with delight, 
As Otway's self had framed the tender lay,— 
                'Tis of a little child 
                Upon a lonesome wild, 
Nor far from home, but she hath lost her way: 
And now moans low in bitter grief and fear, 
And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear. 
 
                           VIII 
'Tis midnight, but small thoughts have I of sleep: 
Full seldom may my friend such vigils keep! 
Visit her, gentle Sleep! with wings of healing, 
         And may this storm be but a mountain-birth, 
May all the stars hang bright above her dwelling, 
         Silent as though they watched the sleeping Earth! 
                With light heart may she rise, 
                Gay fancy, cheerful eyes, 
         Joy lift her spirit, joy attune her voice; 
To her may all things live, from pole to pole, 
Their life the eddying of her living soul!

Samuel Taylor Coleridge,1772–1834,This Lime-tree Bower my Prison,"[Addressed to Charles Lamb, of the India House, London]

Well, they are gone, and here must I remain,
This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost
Beauties and feelings, such as would have been
Most sweet to my remembrance even when age
Had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! They, meanwhile,
Friends, whom I never more may meet again,
On springy heath, along the hill-top edge,
Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,
To that still roaring dell, of which I told;
The roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep,
And only speckled by the mid-day sun;
Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock
Flings arching like a bridge;—that branchless ash,
Unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves
Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,
Fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends
Behold the dark green file of long lank weeds,
That all at once (a most fantastic sight!)
Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge
Of the blue clay-stone.

                                           Now, my friends emerge
Beneath the wide wide Heaven—and view again
The many-steepled tract magnificent
Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea,
With some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up
The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two Isles
Of purple shadow! Yes! they wander on
In gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad,
My gentle-hearted Charles! for thou hast pined
And hunger'd after Nature, many a year,
In the great City pent, winning thy way
With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain
And strange calamity! Ah! slowly sink
Behind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun!
Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,
Ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds!
Live in the yellow light, ye distant groves!
And kindle, thou blue Ocean! So my friend
Struck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood,
Silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round
On the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem
Less gross than bodily; and of such hues
As veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes
Spirits perceive his presence.

                                                        A delight
Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad
As I myself were there! Nor in this bower,
This little lime-tree bower, have I not mark'd
Much that has sooth'd me. Pale beneath the blaze
Hung the transparent foliage; and I watch'd
Some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see
The shadow of the leaf and stem above
Dappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree
Was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay
Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps
Those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass
Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue
Through the late twilight: and though now the bat
Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,
Yet still the solitary humble-bee
Sings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know
That Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure;
No plot so narrow, be but Nature there,
No waste so vacant, but may well employ
Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart
Awake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes
'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good,
That we may lift the soul, and contemplate
With lively joy the joys we cannot share.

Beat its straight path along the dusky air
Homewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing

Had cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory,

Flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm

The Arve and Arveiron at thy base
Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form!
Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,
How silently! Around thee and above
Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black,
An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,
As with a wedge! But when I look again,
It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,
Thy habitation from eternity!

Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,
Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer
I worshipped the Invisible alone.

So sweet, we know not we are listening to it,
Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my Thought,
Yea, with my Life and Life's own secret joy:

Into the mighty vision passing—there
As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!

Keeps pure from falling leaves! Long may the Spring,

Which at the bottom, like a Fairy's Page,
As merry and no taller, dances still,
Nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the Fount.

A soft seat, and a deep and ample shade.

Unhelped by any wind. The owlet's cry
Came loud—and hark, again! loud as before.
The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,
Have left me to that solitude, which suits
Abstruser musings: save that at my side
My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.
'Tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs
And vexes meditation with its strange
And extreme silentness. Sea, hill, and wood,
This populous village! Sea, and hill, and wood,
With all the numberless goings-on of life,
Inaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame
Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;
Only that film, which fluttered on the grate,

Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing.
Methinks, its motion in this hush of nature
Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,
Making it a companionable form,
Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit
By its own moods interprets, every where
Echo or mirror seeking of itself,
And makes a toy of Thought.

                      But O! how oft,
How oft, at school, with most believing mind,
Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars,
To watch that fluttering  stranger ! and as oft
With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt
Of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower,
Whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang
From morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day,
So sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me
With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear
Most like articulate sounds of things to come!
So gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt,
Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!
And so I brooded all the following morn,
Awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye
Fixed with mock study on my swimming book:
Save if the door half opened, and I snatched
A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up,
For still I hoped to see the  stranger's face,
Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,
My play-mate when we both were clothed alike!

         Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,
Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,
Fill up the intersperséd vacancies
And momentary pauses of the thought!
My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart
With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,
And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,
And in far other scenes! For I was reared
In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,
And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.
But  thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze
By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags
Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,
Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores
And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear
The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible
Of that eternal language, which thy God
Utters, who from eternity doth teach
Himself in all, and all things in himself.
Great universal Teacher! he shall mould
Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.

         Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,
Whether the summer clothe the general earth
With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing
Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch
Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch
Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall

Samuel Taylor Coleridge,1772–1834,"Hymn before Sun-rise, in the Vale of Chamouni","Hast thou a charm to stay the morning-star
In his steep course? So long he seems to pause
On thy bald awful head, O sovran BLANC,
The Arve and Arveiron at thy base
Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form!
Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,
How silently! Around thee and above
Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black,
An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,
As with a wedge! But when I look again,
It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,
Thy habitation from eternity!
O dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee,
Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,
Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer
I worshipped the Invisible alone.

     Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody,
So sweet, we know not we are listening to it,
Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my Thought,
Yea, with my Life and Life's own secret joy:
Till the dilating Soul, enrapt, transfused,
Into the mighty vision passing—there
As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!

     Awake, my soul! not only passive praise
Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears,
Mute thanks and secret ecstasy! Awake,
Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!
Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my Hymn.

     Thou first and chief, sole sovereign of the Vale!
O struggling with the darkness all the night,
And visited all night by troops of stars,
Or when they climb the sky or when they sink:
Companion of the morning-star at dawn,
Thyself Earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
Co-herald: wake, O wake, and utter praise!
Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in Earth?
Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?
Who made thee parent of perpetual streams?

Keeps pure from falling leaves! Long may the Spring,

As merry and no taller, dances still,
Nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the Fount.

A soft seat, and a deep and ample shade.

Robert Southey,1774–1843,The Well of St. Keyne,"A Well there is in the west country,
    And a clearer one never was seen;
There is not a wife in the west country
    But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne.
An oak and an elm-tree stand beside,
    And behind doth an ash-tree grow,
And a willow from the bank above
    Droops to the water below.
A traveller came to the Well of St. Keyne;
    Joyfully he drew nigh,
For from the cock-crow he had been travelling,
    And there was not a cloud in the sky.
He drank of the water so cool and clear,
    For thirsty and hot was he,
And he sat down upon the bank
    Under the willow-tree.
There came a man from the house hard by
    At the Well to fill his pail;
On the Well-side he rested it,
    And he bade the Stranger hail.
""Now art thou a bachelor, Stranger?"" quoth he,
    ""For an if thou hast a wife,
The happiest draught thou hast drank this day
    That ever thou didst in thy life.
""Or has thy good woman, if one thou hast,
    Ever here in Cornwall been?
For an if she have, I'll venture my life
    She has drank of the Well of St. Keyne.""
""I have left a good woman who never was here.""
    The Stranger he made reply,
""But that my draught should be the better for that,
    I pray you answer me why?""
""St. Keyne,"" quoth the Cornish-man, ""many a time
    Drank of this crystal Well,
And before the Angel summon'd her,
    She laid on the water a spell.
""If the Husband of this gifted Well
    Shall drink before his Wife,
A happy man thenceforth is he,
    For he shall be Master for life.
""But if the Wife should drink of it first,—
    God help the Husband then!""
The Stranger stoopt to the Well of St. Keyne,
    And drank of the water again.
""You drank of the Well I warrant betimes?""
    He to the Cornish-man said:
But the Cornish-man smiled as the Stranger spake,
    And sheepishly shook his head.
""I hasten'd as soon as the wedding was done,
    And left my Wife in the porch;
But i' faith she had been wiser than me,

Robert Southey,1774–1843,God's Judgment on a Wicked Bishop,"The summer and autumn had been so wet,
That in winter the corn was growing yet,
'Twas a piteous sight to see all around
The grain lie rotting on the ground.
Every day the starving poor
Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door,
For he had a plentiful last-year's store,
And all the neighbourhood could tell
His granaries were furnish'd well.
At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day
To quiet the poor without delay;
He bade them to his great Barn repair,
And they should have food for the winter there.
Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,
The poor folk flock'd from far and near;
The great barn was full as it could hold
Of women and children, and young and old.
Then when he saw it could hold no more,
Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;
And while for mercy on Christ they call,
He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all.
""I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!"" quoth he,
""And the country is greatly obliged to me,
For ridding it in these times forlorn
Of Rats that only consume the corn.""
So then to his palace returned he,
And he sat down to supper merrily,
And he slept that night like an innocent man;
But Bishop Hatto never slept again.
In the morning as he enter'd the hall
Where his picture hung against the wall,
A sweat like death all over him came,
For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame.
As he look'd there came a man from his farm—
He had a countenance white with alarm;
""My Lord, I open'd your granaries this morn,
And the Rats had eaten all your corn.""
Another came running presently,
And he was pale as pale could be,
""Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly,"" quoth he,
""Ten thousand Rats are coming this way,...
The Lord forgive you for yesterday!""
""I'll go to my tower on the Rhine,"" replied he,
""'Tis the safest place in Germany;
The walls are high and the shores are steep,
And the stream is strong and the water deep.""
Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,
And he crost the Rhine without delay,
And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with care
All the windows, doors, and loop-holes there.
He laid him down and closed his eyes;...
But soon a scream made him arise,
He started and saw two eyes of flame
On his pillow from whence the screaming came.
He listen'd and look'd;... it was only the Cat;
And the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,
For she sat screaming, mad with fear
At the Army of Rats that were drawing near.
For they have swum over the river so deep,
And they have climb'd the shores so steep,
And up the Tower their way is bent,
To do the work for which they were sent.
They are not to be told by the dozen or score,
By thousands they come, and by myriads and more,
Such numbers had never been heard of before,
Such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore.
Down on his knees the Bishop fell,
And faster and faster his beads did he tell,
As louder and louder drawing near
The gnawing of their teeth he could hear.
And in at the windows and in at the door,
And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,
And down from the ceiling and up through the floor,
From the right and the left, from behind and before,
From within and without, from above and below,
And all at once to the Bishop they go.
They have whetted their teeth against the stones,
And now they pick the Bishop's bones:
They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,
For they were sent to do judgment on him!",quatrain,stanza forms,"['Rhymed Stanza', 'Quatrain']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45179/gods-judgment-on-a-wicked-bishop,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-southey,,1774.0,1843.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Fie! what filthy hands are here!
Who that e'er could understand
The rare structure of a hand,
With its branching fingers fine,
Work itself of hands divine,
Strong, yet delicately knit,
For ten thousand uses fit,
Overlaid with so clear skin
You may see the blood within,
And the curious palm, disposed
In such lines, some have supposed
You may read the fortunes there
By the figures that appear—
Who this hand would chuse to cover
With a crust of dirt all over,
Till it look'd in hue and shape
Like the fore-foot of an Ape?
Man or boy that works or plays
In the fields or the highways
May, without offence or hurt,
From the soil contract a dirt,
Which the next clear spring or river
Washes out and out for ever—
But to cherish stains impure,
Soil deliberate to endure,
On the skin to fix a stain
Till it works into the grain,
Argues a degenerate mind,
Sordid, slothful, ill inclin'd,
Wanting in that self-respect
Which does virtue best protect.

Virtue next to Godliness,
Easiest, cheapest, needful'st duty,

Charles Lamb,1775–1834,A Farewell to Tobacco,"May the Babylonish curse,
Strait confound my stammering verse,
If I can a passage see
In this word-perplexity,
Or a fit expression find,
Or a language to my mind,
(Still the phrase is wide or scant)
To take leave of thee, GREAT PLANT!
Or in any terms relate
Half my love, or half my hate:
For I hate, yet love, thee so,
That, whichever thing I shew,
The plain truth will seem to be
A constrained hyperbole,
And the passion to proceed
More from a mistress than a weed.
Sooty retainer to the vine,
Bacchus' black servant, negro fine;
Sorcerer, that mak'st us dote upon
Thy begrimed complexion,
And, for thy pernicious sake,
More and greater oaths to break
Than reclaimed lovers take
'Gainst women: thou thy siege dost lay
Much too in the female way,
While thou suck'st the laboring breath
Faster than kisses or than death.
Thou in such a cloud dost bind us,
That our worst foes cannot find us,
And ill fortune, that would thwart us,
Shoots at rovers, shooting at us;
While each man, thro' thy heightening steam,
Does like a smoking Etna seem,
And all about us does express
(Fancy and wit in richest dress)
A Sicilian fruitfulness.
Thou through such a mist dost shew us,
That our best friends do not know us,
And, for those allowed features,
Due to reasonable creatures,
Liken'st us to fell Chimeras,
Monsters that, who see us, fear us
Worse than Cerberus or Geryon,
Or, who first lov'd a cloud, Ixion.
Bacchus we know, and we allow
His tipsy rites. But what art thou,
That but by reflex can'st shew
What his deity can do,
As the false Egyptian spell
Aped the true Hebrew miracle?
Some few vapours thou may'st raise,
The weak brain may serve to amaze,
But to the reigns and nobler heart
Can'st nor life nor heat impart.
Brother of Bacchus, later born,
The old world was sure forlorn,
Wanting thee, that aidest more
The god's victories than before
All his panthers, and the brawls
Of his piping Bacchanals.
These, as stale, we disallow,
Or judge of thee meant - only thou
His true Indian conquest art
And, for ivy round his dart,
The reformed god now weaves
A finer thyrsus of thy leaves.
Scent to match thy rich perfume
Chemic art did ne'er presume
Through her quaint alembic strain,
None so sov'reign to the brain.
Nature, that did in thee excel,
Fram'd again no second smell.
Roses, violets, but toys
For the smaller sort of boys,
Or for greener damsels meant;
Thou art the only manly scent.
Stinking'st of the stinking kind,
Filth of the mouth and fog of the mind,
Africa, that brags her foyson,
Breeds no such prodigious poison,
Henbane, nightshade, both together,
Hemlock, aconite —
Nay, rather, Plant divine, of rarest virtue;
Blisters on the tongue would hurt you.
'Twas but in a sort I blam'd thee;
None e'er prosper'd who defam'd thee;
Irony all, and feign'd abuse,
Such as perplext lovers use,
At a need, when, in despair
To paint forth their fairest fair,
Or in part but to express
That exceeding comeliness
Which their fancies doth so strike,
They borrow language of dislike;
And, instead of Dearest Miss,
Jewel, Honey, Sweetheart, Bliss,
And those forms of old admiring,
Call her Cockatrice and Siren,
Basilisk, and all that's evil,
Witch, Hyena, Mermaid, Devil,
Ethiop, Wench, and Blackamoor,
Monkey, Ape, and twenty more;
Friendly Trait'ress, loving Foe, —
Not that she is truly so,
But no other way they know
A contentment to express,
Borders so upon excess,
That they do not rightly wot
Whether it be pain or not.
Or, as men, constrained to part
With what's nearest to their heart,
While their sorrow's at the height,
Lose discrimination quite,
And their hasty wrath let fall,
To appease their frantic gall,
On the darling thing whatever
Whence they feel it death to sever,
Though it be, as they, perforce,
Guiltless of the sad divorce.
For I must (nor let it grieve thee,
Friendliest of plants, that I must) leave the.
For thy sake, TOBACCO, I
Would do any thing but die,
And but seek to extend my days
Long enough to sing thy praise.
But, as she, who once hath been
A king's consort, is a queen
Ever after, nor will bate
Any tittle of her state,
Though a widow, or divorced,
So I, from thy converse forced,
The old name and style retain,
A right Katherine of Spain;
And a seat, too, 'mongst the joys
Of the blest Tobacco Boys;
Where, though I, by sour physician,
Am debarr'd the full fruition
Of thy favours, I may catch
Some collateral sweets, and snatch
Sidelong odours, that give life
Like glances from a neighbour's wife;
And still live in the by-places
And the suburbs of thy graces;
And in thy borders take delight,

Charles Lamb,1775–1834,On an Infant Dying as Soon as Born,"I saw where in the shroud did lurk
A curious frame of Nature's work.
A flow'ret crushed in the bud,
A nameless piece of Babyhood,
Was in a cradle-coffin lying;
Extinct, with scarce the sense of dying;
So soon to exchange the imprisoning womb
For darker closets of the tomb!
She did but ope an eye, and put
A clear beam forth, then strait up shut
For the long dark: ne'er more to see
Through glasses of mortality.
Riddle of destiny, who can show
What thy short visit meant, or know
What thy errand here below?
Shall we say, that Nature blind
Check'd her hand, and changed her mind,
Just when she had exactly wrought
A finish'd pattern without fault?
Could she flag, or could she tire,
Or lack'd she the Promethean fire
(With her nine moons' long workings sicken'd)
That should thy little limbs have quicken'd?
Limbs so firm, they seem'd to assure
Life of health, and days mature:
Woman's self in miniature!
Limbs so fair, they might supply
(Themselves now but cold imagery)
The sculptor to make Beauty by.
Or did the stern-eyed Fate descry,
That babe, or mother, one must die;
So in mercy left the stock,
And cut the branch; to save the shock
Of young years widow'd; and the pain,
When Single State comes back again
To the lone man who, 'reft of wife,
Thenceforward drags a maimed life?
The economy of Heaven is dark;
And wisest clerks have miss'd the mark,
Why Human Buds, like this, should fall,
More brief than fly ephemeral,
That has his day; while shrivel'd crones
Stiffen with age to stocks and stones;
And crabbed use the conscience sears
In sinners of an hundred years.
Mother's prattle, mother's kiss,
Baby fond, thou ne'er wilt miss.
Rites, which custom does impose,
Silver bells and baby clothes;
Coral redder than those lips,
Which pale death did late eclipse;
Music framed for infants' glee,
Whistle never tuned for thee;
Though thou want'st not, thou shalt have them,
Loving hearts were they which gave them.
Let not one be missing; nurse,
See them laid upon the hearse
Of infant slain by doom perverse.
Why should kings and nobles have
Pictured trophies to their grave;
And we, churls, to thee deny
Thy pretty toys with thee to lie,

Walter Savage Landor,1775–1864,Fæsulan Idyl,"Here, where precipitate Spring with one light bound
Into hot Summer’s lusty arms expires;
And where go forth at morn, at eve, at night,
Soft airs, that want the lute to play with them,
And softer sighs, that know not what they want;
Under a wall, beneath an orange-tree
Whose tallest flowers could tell the lowlier ones
Of sights in Fiesole right up above,
While I was gazing a few paces off
At what they seemed to show me with their nods,
Their frequent whispers and their pointing shoots,
A gentle maid came down the garden-steps
And gathered the pure treasure in her lap.
I heard the branches rustle, and stept forth
To drive the ox away, or mule, or goat,
(Such I believed it must be); for sweet scents
Are the swift vehicles of still sweeter thoughts,
And nurse and pillow the dull memory
That would let drop without them her best stores.
They bring me tales of youth and tones of love,
And ’tis and ever was my wish and way
To let all flowers live freely, and all die,
Whene’er their Genius bids their souls depart,
Among their kindred in their native place.
I never pluck the rose; the violet’s head
Hath shaken with my breath upon its bank
And not reproacht me; the ever-sacred cup
Of the pure lily hath between my hands
Felt safe, unsoil’d, nor lost one grain of gold.
I saw the light that made the glossy leaves
More glossy; the fair arm, the fairer cheek
Warmed by the eye intent on its pursuit;
I saw the foot, that, altho half-erect
From its grey slipper, could not lift her up
To what she wanted: I held down a branch
And gather’d her some blossoms, since their hour
Was come, and bees had wounded them, and flies
Of harder wing were working their way thro
And scattering them in fragments under foot.
So crisp were some, they rattled unevolved,
Others, ere broken off, fell into shells,
For such appear the petals when detacht,
Unbending, brittle, lucid, white like snow,
And like snow not seen thro, by eye or sun:
Yet every one her gown received from me
Was fairer than the first . . I thought not so,
But so she praised them to reward my care.
I said: you find the largest.

This indeed,
Cried she, is large and sweet.

                                 She held one forth,
Whether for me to look at or to take
She knew not, nor did I; but taking it
Would best have solved (and this she felt) her doubts.
I dared not touch it; for it seemed a part
Of her own self; fresh, full, the most mature
Of blossoms, yet a blossom; with a touch
To fall, and yet unfallen.

                          She drew back
The boon she tendered, and then, finding not
The ribbon at her waist to fix it in,
Dropt it, as loth to drop it, on the rest.",blank verse,meters,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Summer', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Blank Verse', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44563/faesulan-idyl,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walter-savage-landor,,1775.0,1864.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Walter Savage Landor,1775–1864,"Acon and Rhodope; or, Inconstancy","The Year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by, 
Of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve, 
Some froward, some sedater, some adorn’d 
For festival, some reckless of attire. 
The snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers 
Had withered in the meadow; fig and prune 
Hung wrinkling; the last apple glow’d amid 
Its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt 
Between the trodden corn and twisted vine, 
Under whose bunches stood the empty crate, 
To creak ere long beneath them carried home. 
This was the season when twelve months before, 
O gentle Hamadryad, true to love! 
Thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood 
Was blasted and laid desolate: but none 
Dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck 
The moss beneath it, which alone remain’d 
Of what was thine. 
 
                            Old Thallinos sat mute 
In solitary sadness. The strange tale 
(Not until Rhaicos died, but then the whole) 
Echion had related, whom no force 
Could ever make look back upon the oaks. 
The father said “Echion! thou must weigh, 
Carefully, and with steady hand, enough 
(Although no longer comes the store as once!) 
Of wax to burn all day and night upon 
That hollow stone where milk and honey lie: 
So may the Gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!” 
Thallinos bore it thither in the morn, 
And lighted it and left it. 
 
                                          First of those 
Who visited upon this solemn day 
The Hamadryad’s oak, were Rhodope 
And Acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. 
Graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate 
She sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first 
 
Lapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands 
Were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. 
Now stood the two aside the hollow stone 
And lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak 
Shivered and black and bare. 
 
                                           “May never we 
Love as they loved!” said Acon. She at this 
Smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, 
And thought not of its bliss, but of its end. 
He caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d 
Nor time nor other power, whereto the might 
Of love hath yielded and may yield again, 
Should alter his. 
 
                           The father of the youth 
Wanted not beauty for him, wanted not 
Song, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart, 
Discretion, that could guide him thro’ the world, 
Innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; 
Silver and gold and land, not green before 
The ancestral gate, but purple under skies 
Bending far off, he wanted for his heir. 
 
       Fathers have given life, but virgin heart 
They never gave; and dare they then control 
Or check it harshly? dare they break a bond 
Girt round it by the holiest Power on high? 
 
       Acon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly, 
But Acon had complied . . ’twas dutiful! 
 
       Crush thy own heart, Man! Man! but fear to wound 
The gentler, that relies on thee alone, 
By thee created, weak or strong by thee; 
Touch it not but for worship; watch before 
Its sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed 
The temple-doors and the last lamp is spent. 
 
       Rhodope, in her soul’s waste solitude, 
Sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea, 
Often not hearing it, and many tears 
Had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek. 
Meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks, 
Nor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone 
That held the milk and honey, nor to lay 
His plighted hand where recently ’twas laid 
Opposite hers, when finger playfully 
Advanced and pusht back finger, on each side. 
He did not think of this, as she would do 
If she were there alone. 
 
                                     The day was hot; 
The moss invited him; it cool’d his cheek, 
It cool’d his hands; he thrust them into it 
And sank to slumber. Never was there dream 
Divine as his. He saw the Hamadryad. 
She took him by the arm and led him on 
Along a valley, where profusely grew 
The smaller lilies with their pendent bells, 
And, hiding under mint, chill drosera, 
The violet shy of butting cyclamen, 
The feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks, 
Her offspring round her, the soft strawberry; 
The quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk, 
The oleander’s light-hair’d progeny 
Breathing bright freshness in each other’s face, 
And graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup 
 
Of fragrance and of beauty, boon for Gods. 
The fragrance fill’d his breast with such delight 
His senses were bewildered, and he thought 
He saw again the face he most had loved. 
He stopt: the Hamadryad at his side 
Now stood between; then drew him farther off: 
He went, compliant as before: but soon 
Verdure had ceast: altho’ the ground was smooth, 
Nothing was there delightful. At this change 
He would have spoken, but his guide represt 
All questioning, and said, 
 
                                        “Weak youth! what brought 
Thy footstep to this wood, my native haunt, 
My life-long residence? this bank, where first 
I sate with him . . the faithful (now I know, 
Too late!) the faithful Rhaicos. Haste thee home; 
Be happy, if thou canst; but come no more 
Where those whom death alone could sever, died.” 
 
       He started up: the moss whereon he slept 
Was dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread 
Over his cheek; he sickened: and the sire 
Had land enough; it held his only son.",blank verse,meters,"['Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Blank Verse', 'Allusion', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44558/acon-and-rhodope-or-inconstancy,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walter-savage-landor,,1775.0,1864.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Thomas Moore,1779–1852,A Ballad: The Lake of the Dismal Swamp,"Written at Norfolk, in Virginia

“They made her a grave, too cold and damp
For a soul so warm and true;
And she’s gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,
Where, all night long, by a fire-fly lamp,
She paddles her white canoe.

“And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,
And her paddle I soon shall hear;
Long and loving our life shall be,
And I’ll hide the maid in a cypress tree,
When the footstep of death is near.”

Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds—
His path was rugged and sore,
Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,
Through many a fen where the serpent feeds,
And man never trod before.

And when on the earth he sunk to sleep,
If slumber his eyelids knew,
He lay where the deadly vine doth weep
Its venomous tear and nightly steep
The flesh with blistering dew!

And near him the she-wolf stirr’d the brake,
And the copper-snake breath’d in his ear,
Till he starting cried, from his dream awake,
“Oh! when shall I see the dusky Lake,
And the white canoe of my dear?”

He saw the Lake, and a meteor bright
Quick over its surface play’d—
“Welcome,” he said, “my dear one’s light!”
And the dim shore echoed for many a night
The name of the death-cold maid.

Till he hollow’d a boat of the birchen bark,
Which carried him off from shore;
Far, far he follow’d the meteor spark,
The wind was high and the clouds were dark,
And the boat return’d no more.

But oft, from the Indian hunter’s camp,
This lover and maid so true
Are seen at the hour of midnight damp
To cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp,
And paddle their white canoe!",ballad,verse forms,"['Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Ghosts & the Supernatural', 'Horror', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44780/a-ballad-the-lake-of-the-dismal-swamp,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/thomas-moore,,1779.0,1852.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Thomas Moore,1779–1852,from Lalla Rookh,"From The Fire-worshippers

“How sweetly,” said the trembling maid, 
Of her own gentle voice afraid, 
So long had they in silence stood, 
Looking upon that tranquil flood— 
“How sweetly does the moon-beam smile 
To-night upon yon leafy isle! 
Oft in my fancy’s wanderings, 
I’ve wish’d that little isle had wings, 
And we, within its fairy bow’rs, 
      Were wafted off to seas unknown, 
Where not a pulse should beat but ours, 
      And we might live, love, die alone! 
Far from the cruel and the cold,— 
      Where the bright eyes of angels only 
Should come around us, to behold 
      A paradise so pure and lonely. 
Would this be world enough for thee?”— 
Playful she turn’d, that he might see 
      The passing smile her cheek put on; 
But when she mark’d how mournfully 
      His eyes met hers, that smile was gone; 
And, bursting into heart-felt tears, 
“Yes, yes,” she cried, “my hourly fears 
My dreams have boded all too right— 
We part—for ever part—to-night! 
I knew, I knew it  could not last— 
’Twas bright, ’twas heav’nly, but ’tis past! 
Oh! ever thus, from childhood’s hour, 
I’ve seen my fondest hopes decay; 
I never lov’d a tree or flow’r, 
      But ’twas the first to fade away. 
I never nurs’d a dear gazelle 
      To glad me with its soft black eye, 
But when it came to know me well 
      And love me, it was sure to die! 
Now too—the joy most like divine 
      Of all I ever dreamt or knew, 
To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,— 
      Oh misery! must I lose  that too? 
Yet go—on peril’s brink we meet;—

No, never come again—though sweet, 
      Though heav’n, it may be death to thee. 
Farewell—and blessings on thy way,

Clement Clarke Moore,1779–1863,A Visit from St. Nicholas,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—

Leigh Hunt,1784–1859,The Glove and the Lions,"King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport, 
And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court; 
The nobles filled the benches, and the ladies in their pride, 
And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed: 
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show, 
Valour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below. 
 
Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws; 
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws; 
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another; 
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother; 
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air; 
Said Francis then, ""Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there."" 
 
De Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous lively dame 
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seemed the same; 
She thought, the Count my lover is brave as brave can be; 
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me; 
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine; 
I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine. 
 
She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;

Lord Byron (George Gordon),1788–1824,"January 22nd, Missolonghi","On this Day I Complete my Thirty-Sixth Year

'Tis time this heart should be unmoved, 
       Since others it hath ceased to move: 
Yet though I cannot be beloved, 
                                    Still let me love! 
 
   My days are in the yellow leaf; 
       The flowers and fruits of Love are gone; 
The worm—the canker, and the grief 
                                    Are mine alone! 
 
   The fire that on my bosom preys 
       Is lone as some Volcanic Isle; 
No torch is kindled at its blaze 
                                    A funeral pile. 
 
   The hope, the fear, the jealous care, 
       The exalted portion of the pain 
And power of Love I cannot share, 
                                    But wear the chain. 
 
   But 'tis not thus—and 'tis not here 
       Such thoughts should shake my Soul, nor now, 
Where Glory decks the hero's bier, 
                                    Or binds his brow. 
 
   The Sword, the Banner, and the Field, 
       Glory and Greece around us see! 
The Spartan borne upon his shield 
                                    Was not more free. 
 
   Awake (not Greece—she is awake!) 
       Awake, my Spirit! Think through whom 
Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake 
                                    And then strike home! 
 
   Tread those reviving passions down 
       Unworthy Manhood—unto thee 
Indifferent should the smile or frown 
                                    Of beauty be. 
 
   If thou regret'st thy Youth, why live? 
       The land of honourable Death 
Is here:—up to the Field, and give 
                                    Away thy breath! 
 
   Seek out—less often sought than found— 
       A Soldier's Grave, for thee the best; 
Then look around, and choose thy Ground, 
                                    And take thy rest.",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Growing Old', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Ballad']","Source:

Lord Byron (George Gordon),1788–1824,"Dear Doctor, I have Read your Play","Dear Doctor, I have read your play,
Which is a good one in its way,
Purges the eyes, and moves the bowels,
And drenches handkerchiefs like towels
With tears that, in a flux of grief,
Afford hysterical relief
To shatter'd nerves and quicken'd pulses,
Which your catastrophe convulses.
I like your moral and machinery;
Your plot, too, has such scope for scenery!
Your dialogue is apt and smart;
The play's concoction full of art;
Your hero raves, your heroine cries,
All stab, and everybody dies;
In short, your tragedy would be
The very thing to hear and see;
And for a piece of publication,
If I decline on this occasion,
It is not that I am not sensible
To merits in themselves ostensible,
But—and I grieve to speak it—plays
Are drugs—mere drugs, Sir, nowadays.
I had a heavy loss by  Manuel —
Too lucky if it prove not annual—
And Sotheby, with his damn'd  Orestes
(Which, by the way, the old bore's best is),
Has lain so very long on hand
That I despair of all demand;
I've advertis'd—but see my books,
Or only watch my shopman's looks;
Still Ivan, Ina and such lumber
My back-shop glut, my shelves encumber.
There's Byron too, who once did better,
Has sent me—folded in a letter—
A sort of—it's no more a drama
Than Darnley, Ivan or Kehama:
So alter'd since last year his pen is,
I think he's lost his wits at Venice,
Or drain'd his brains away as stallion
To some dark-eyed and warm Italian;
In short, Sir, what with one and t'other,
I dare not venture on another.
I write in haste; excuse each blunder;
The coaches through the street so thunder!
My room's so full; we've Gifford here
Reading MSS with Hookham Frere,
Pronouncing on the nouns and particles
Of some of our forthcoming articles,
The Quarterly—ah, Sir, if you
Had but the genius to review!
A smart critique upon St. Helena,
Or if you only would but tell in a
Short compass what—but, to resume;
As I was saying, Sir, the room—
The room's so full of wits and bards,
Crabbes, Campbells, Crokers, Freres and Wards,
And others, neither bards nor wits—
My humble tenement admits
All persons in the dress of Gent.,
From Mr. Hammond to Dog Dent.
A party dines with me today,
All clever men who make their way:
Crabbe, Malcolm, Hamilton and Chantrey
Are all partakers of my pantry.
They're at this moment in discussion
On poor De Staël's late dissolution.
Her book, they say, was in advance—
Pray Heaven she tell the truth of France!
'Tis said she certainly was married
To Rocca, and had twice miscarried,
No—not miscarried, I opine—
But brought to bed at forty nine.
Some say she died a Papist; some
Are of opinion that's a hum;
I don't know that—the fellow, Schlegel,
Was very likely to inveigle
A dying person in compunction
To try the extremity of unction.
But peace be with her! for a woman
Her talents surely were uncommon.
Her publisher (and public too)
The hour of her demise may rue,
For never more within his shop he—
Pray—was she not interr'd at Coppet?
Thus run our time and tongues away;
But, to return, Sir, to your play;
Sorry, Sir, but I cannot deal,
Unless 'twere acted by O'Neill.
My hands are full—my head so busy,
I'm almost dead—and always dizzy;
And so, with endless truth and hurry,
Dear Doctor, I am yours,

Lord Byron (George Gordon),1788–1824,Darkness,"I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation; and all hearts
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:
And they did live by watchfires—and the thrones,
The palaces of crowned kings—the huts,
The habitations of all things which dwell,
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd,
And men were gather'd round their blazing homes
To look once more into each other's face;
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:
A fearful hope was all the world contain'd;
Forests were set on fire—but hour by hour
They fell and faded—and the crackling trunks
Extinguish'd with a crash—and all was black.
The brows of men by the despairing light
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd;
And others hurried to and fro, and fed
Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up
With mad disquietude on the dull sky,
The pall of a past world; and then again
With curses cast them down upon the dust,
And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd
And twin'd themselves among the multitude,
Hissing, but stingless—they were slain for food.
And War, which for a moment was no more,
Did glut himself again: a meal was bought
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left;
All earth was but one thought—and that was death
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
Of famine fed upon all entrails—men
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
The meagre by the meagre were devour'd,
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,
And he was faithful to a corse, and kept
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay,
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead
Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
But with a piteous and perpetual moan,
And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand
Which answer'd not with a caress—he died.
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two
Of an enormous city did survive,
And they were enemies: they met beside
The dying embers of an altar-place
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things
 For an unholy usage; they rak'd up,
And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath
Blew for a little life, and made a flame
Which was a mockery; then they lifted up
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld
Each other's aspects—saw, and shriek'd, and died—
Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,
The populous and the powerful was a lump,
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless—
A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay.
The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,
And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths;
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd
They slept on the abyss without a surge—
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before;
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need
Of aid from them—She was the Universe.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Nature', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43825/darkness-56d222aeeee1b,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lord-byron,,1788.0,1824.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792 – 1822,On the Medusa of Leonardo Da Vinci in the Florentine Gallery,"It lieth, gazing on the midnight sky,
  Upon the cloudy mountain peak supine;
Below, far lands are seen tremblingly;
  Its horror and its beauty are divine.
Upon its lips and eyelids seems to lie
  Loveliness like a shadow, from which shrine,
Fiery and lurid, struggling underneath,
The agonies of anguish and of death.

Yet it is less the horror than the grace
  Which turns the gazer's spirit into stone;
Whereon the lineaments of that dead face
  Are graven, till the characters be grown
Into itself, and thought no more can trace;
  'Tis the melodious hue of beauty thrown
Athwart the darkness and the glare of pain,
Which humanize and harmonize the strain.

And from its head as from one body grow,
  As [   ] grass out of a watery rock,
Hairs which are vipers, and they curl and flow
  And their long tangles in each other lock,
And with unending involutions shew
  Their mailed radiance, as it were to mock
The torture and the death within, and saw
The solid air with many a ragged jaw.

And from a stone beside, a poisonous eft
  Peeps idly into those Gorgonian eyes;
Whilst in the air a ghastly bat, bereft
  Of sense, has flitted with a mad surprise
Out of the cave this hideous light had cleft,
  And he comes hastening like a moth that hies
After a taper; and the midnight sky
Flares, a light more dread than obscurity.

'Tis the tempestuous loveliness of terror;
  For from the serpents gleams a brazen glare
Kindled by that inextricable error,
  Which makes a thrilling vapour of the air
Become a [ ] and ever-shifting mirror
  Of all the beauty and the terror there—
A woman's countenance, with serpent locks,
Gazing in death on heaven from those wet rocks.",ekphrasis,types/modes,"['Ekphrastic', 'Public Domain', 'Visual Art']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/medusa-leonardo-da-vinci-florentine-gallery,https://poets.org/poet/percy-bysshe-shelley,1819,1792.0,1822.0,['Ekphrastic'],"['Public Domain', 'Visual Art']",[],Academy of American Poets

Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Ambition', 'Grief', 'History', 'Public Domain', 'Farewell']","This poem is in the public domain.

Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,Lines Written among the Euganean Hills,"Many a green isle needs must be 
In the deep wide sea of Misery, 
Or the mariner, worn and wan, 
Never thus could voyage on 
Day and night, and night and day, 
Drifting on his dreary way, 
With the solid darkness black 
Closing round his vessel's track; 
Whilst above, the sunless sky, 
Big with clouds, hangs heavily, 
And behind, the tempest fleet 
Hurries on with lightning feet, 
Riving sail, and cord, and plank, 
Till the ship has almost drank 
Death from the o'er-brimming deep; 
And sinks down, down, like that sleep 
When the dreamer seems to be 
Weltering through eternity; 
And the dim low line before 
Of a dark and distant shore 
Still recedes, as ever still 
Longing with divided will, 
But no power to seek or shun, 
He is ever drifted on 
O'er the unreposing wave 
To the haven of the grave. 
What, if there no friends will greet; 
What, if there no heart will meet 
His with love's impatient beat; 
Wander wheresoe'er he may, 
Can he dream before that day 
To find refuge from distress 
In friendship's smile, in love's caress? 
Then 'twill wreak him little woe 
Whether such there be or no: 
Senseless is the breast and cold 
Which relenting love would fold; 
Bloodless are the veins and chill 
Which the pulse of pain did fill; 
Every little living nerve 
That from bitter words did swerve 
Round the tortur'd lips and brow, 
Are like sapless leaflets now 
Frozen upon December's bough. 
 
On the beach of a northern sea 
Which tempests shake eternally, 
As once the wretch there lay to sleep, 
Lies a solitary heap, 
One white skull and seven dry bones, 
On the margin of the stones, 
Where a few gray rushes stand, 
Boundaries of the sea and land: 
Nor is heard one voice of wail 
But the sea-mews, as they sail 
O'er the billows of the gale; 
Or the whirlwind up and down 
Howling, like a slaughter'd town, 
When a king in glory rides 
Through the pomp of fratricides: 
Those unburied bones around 
There is many a mournful sound; 
There is no lament for him, 
Like a sunless vapour, dim, 
Who once cloth'd with life and thought 
What now moves nor murmurs not. 
 
Ay, many flowering islands lie 
In the waters of wide Agony: 
To such a one this morn was led 
My bark, by soft winds piloted: 
'Mid the mountains Euganean 
I stood listening to the paean 
With which the legion'd rooks did hail 
The sun's uprise majestical; 
Gathering round with wings all hoar, 
Through the dewy mist they soar 
Like gray shades, till the eastern heaven 
Bursts, and then, as clouds of even, 
Fleck'd with fire and azure, lie 
In the unfathomable sky, 
So their plumes of purple grain, 
Starr'd with drops of golden rain, 
Gleam above the sunlight woods, 
As in silent multitudes 
On the morning's fitful gale 
Through the broken mist they sail, 
And the vapours cloven and gleaming 
Follow, down the dark steep streaming, 
Till all is bright, and clear, and still, 
Round the solitary hill. 
 
Beneath is spread like a green sea 
The waveless plain of Lombardy, 
Bounded by the vaporous air, 
Islanded by cities fair; 
Underneath Day's azure eyes 
Ocean's nursling, Venice lies, 
A peopled labyrinth of walls, 
Amphitrite's destin'd halls, 
Which her hoary sire now paves 
With his blue and beaming waves. 
Lo! the sun upsprings behind, 
Broad, red, radiant, half-reclin'd 
On the level quivering line 
Of the water crystalline; 
And before that chasm of light, 
As within a furnace bright, 
Column, tower, and dome, and spire, 
Shine like obelisks of fire, 
Pointing with inconstant motion 
From the altar of dark ocean 
To the sapphire-tinted skies; 
As the flames of sacrifice 
From the marble shrines did rise, 
As to pierce the dome of gold 
Where Apollo spoke of old. 
 
Sun-girt City, thou hast been 
Ocean's child, and then his queen; 
Now is come a darker day, 
And thou soon must be his prey, 
If the power that rais'd thee here 
Hallow so thy watery bier. 
A less drear ruin then than now, 
With thy conquest-branded brow 
Stooping to the slave of slaves 
From thy throne, among the waves 
Wilt thou be, when the sea-mew 
Flies, as once before it flew, 
O'er thine isles depopulate, 
And all is in its ancient state, 
Save where many a palace gate 
With green sea-flowers overgrown 
Like a rock of Ocean's own, 
Topples o'er the abandon'd sea 
As the tides change sullenly. 
The fisher on his watery way, 
Wandering at the close of day, 
Will spread his sail and seize his oar 
Till he pass the gloomy shore, 
Lest thy dead should, from their sleep 
Bursting o'er the starlight deep, 
Lead a rapid masque of death 
O'er the waters of his path. 
Those who alone thy towers behold 
Quivering through a{:e}real gold, 
As I now behold them here, 
Would imagine not they were 
Sepulchres, where human forms, 
Like pollution-nourish'd worms, 
To the corpse of greatness cling, 
Murder'd, and now mouldering: 
But if Freedom should awake 
In her omnipotence, and shake 
From the Celtic Anarch's hold 
All the keys of dungeons cold, 
Where a hundred cities lie 
Chain'd like thee, ingloriously, 
Thou and all thy sister band 
Might adorn this sunny land, 
Twining memories of old time 
With new virtues more sublime; 
If not, perish thou and they, 
Clouds which stain truth's rising day 
By her sun consum'd away— 
Earth can spare ye! while like flowers, 
In the waste of years and hours, 
From your dust new nations spring 
With more kindly blossoming. 
 
Perish—let there only be 
Floating o'er thy hearthless sea 
As the garment of thy sky 
Clothes the world immortally, 
One remembrance, more sublime 
Than the tatter'd pall of time, 
Which scarce hides thy visage wan: 
That a tempest-cleaving Swan 
Of the sons of Albion, 
Driven from his ancestral streams 
By the might of evil dreams, 
Found a nest in thee; and Ocean 
Welcom'd him with such emotion 
That its joy grew his, and sprung 
From his lips like music flung 
O'er a mighty thunder-fit, 
Chastening terror: what though yet 
Poesy's unfailing river, 
Which through Albion winds forever 
Lashing with melodious wave 
Many a sacred Poet's grave, 
Mourn its latest nursling fled! 
What though thou with all thy dead 
Scarce can for this fame repay 
Aught thine own, oh, rather say 
Though thy sins and slaveries foul 
Overcloud a sunlike soul! 
As the ghost of Homer clings 
Round Scamander's wasting springs; 
As divinest Shakespeare's might 
Fills Avon and the world with light 
Like omniscient power which he 
Imag'd 'mid mortality; 
As the love from Petrarch's urn 
Yet amid yon hills doth burn, 
A quenchless lamp by which the heart 
Sees things unearthly; so thou art, 
Mighty spirit: so shall be 
The City that did refuge thee. 
 
Lo, the sun floats up the sky 
Like thought-winged Liberty, 
Till the universal light 
Seems to level plain and height; 
From the sea a mist has spread, 
And the beams of morn lie dead 
On the towers of Venice now, 
Like its glory long ago. 
By the skirts of that gray cloud 
Many-domed Padua proud 
Stands, a peopled solitude, 
'Mid the harvest-shining plain, 
Where the peasant heaps his grain 
In the garner of his foe, 
And the milk-white oxen slow 
With the purple vintage strain, 
Heap'd upon the creaking wain, 
That the brutal Celt may swill 
Drunken sleep with savage will; 
And the sickle to the sword 
Lies unchang'd though many a lord, 
Like a weed whose shade is poison, 
Overgrows this region's foison, 
Sheaves of whom are ripe to come 
To destruction's harvest-home: 
Men must reap the things they sow, 
Force from force must ever flow, 
Or worse; but 'tis a bitter woe 
That love or reason cannot change 
The despot's rage, the slave's revenge. 
 
Padua, thou within whose walls 
Those mute guests at festivals, 
Son and Mother, Death and Sin, 
Play'd at dice for Ezzelin, 
Till Death cried, 'I win, I win!' 
And Sin curs'd to lose the wager, 
But Death promis'd, to assuage her, 
That he would petition for 
Her to be made Vice-Emperor, 
When the destin'd years were o'er, 
Over all between the Po 
And the eastern Alpine snow, 
Under the mighty Austrian. 
Sin smil'd so as Sin only can, 
And since that time, ay, long before, 
Both have rul'd from shore to shore, 
That incestuous pair, who follow 
Tyrants as the sun the swallow, 
As Repentance follows Crime, 
And as changes follow Time. 
 
In thine halls the lamp of learning, 
Padua, now no more is burning; 
Like a meteor, whose wild way 
Is lost over the grave of day, 
It gleams betray'd and to betray: 
Once remotest nations came 
To adore that sacred flame, 
When it lit not many a hearth 
On this cold and gloomy earth: 
Now new fires from antique light 
Spring beneath the wide world's might; 
But their spark lies dead in thee, 
Trampled out by Tyranny. 
As the Norway woodman quells, 
In the depth of piny dells, 
One light flame among the brakes, 
While the boundless forest shakes, 
And its mighty trunks are torn 
By the fire thus lowly born: 
The spark beneath his feet is dead, 
He starts to see the flames it fed 
Howling through the darken'd sky 
With myriad tongues victoriously, 
And sinks down in fear: so thou, 
O Tyranny, beholdest now 
Light around thee, and thou hearest 
The loud flames ascend, and fearest: 
Grovel on the earth; ay, hide 
In the dust thy purple pride! 
 
Noon descends around me now: 
'Tis the noon of autumn's glow, 
When a soft and purple mist 
Like a vaporous amethyst, 
Or an air-dissolved star 
Mingling light and fragrance, far 
From the curv'd horizon's bound 
To the point of Heaven's profound, 
Fills the overflowing sky; 
And the plains that silent lie 
Underneath, the leaves unsodden 
Where the infant Frost has trodden 
With his morning-winged feet, 
Whose bright print is gleaming yet; 
And the red and golden vines, 
Piercing with their trellis'd lines 
The rough, dark-skirted wilderness; 
The dun and bladed grass no less, 
Pointing from his hoary tower 
In the windless air; the flower 
Glimmering at my feet; the line 
Of the olive-sandall'd Apennine 
In the south dimly islanded; 
And the Alps, whose snows are spread 
High between the clouds and sun; 
And of living things each one; 
And my spirit which so long 
Darken'd this swift stream of song, 
Interpenetrated lie 
By the glory of the sky: 
Be it love, light, harmony, 
Odour, or the soul of all 
Which from Heaven like dew doth fall, 
Or the mind which feeds this verse 
Peopling the lone universe. 
 
Noon descends, and after noon 
Autumn's evening meets me soon, 
Leading the infantine moon, 
And that one star, which to her 
Almost seems to minister 
Half the crimson light she brings 
From the sunset's radiant springs: 
And the soft dreams of the morn 
(Which like winged winds had borne 
To that silent isle, which lies 
Mid remember'd agonies, 
The frail bark of this lone being) 
Pass, to other sufferers fleeing, 
And its ancient pilot, Pain, 
Sits beside the helm again. 
 
Other flowering isles must be 
In the sea of Life and Agony: 
Other spirits float and flee 
O'er that gulf: even now, perhaps, 
On some rock the wild wave wraps, 
With folded wings they waiting sit 
For my bark, to pilot it 
To some calm and blooming cove, 
Where for me, and those I love, 
May a windless bower be built, 
Far from passion, pain and guilt, 
In a dell mid lawny hills, 
Which the wild sea-murmur fills, 
And soft sunshine, and the sound 
Of old forests echoing round, 
And the light and smell divine 
Of all flowers that breathe and shine: 
We may live so happy there, 
That the Spirits of the Air, 
Envying us, may even entice 
To our healing paradise 
The polluting multitude; 
But their rage would be subdu'd 
By that clime divine and calm, 
And the winds whose wings rain balm 
On the uplifted soul, and leaves 
Under which the bright sea heaves; 
While each breathless interval 
In their whisperings musical 
The inspired soul supplies 
With its own deep melodies, 
And the love which heals all strife 
Circling, like the breath of life, 
All things in that sweet abode 
With its own mild brotherhood: 
They, not it, would change; and soon 
Every sprite beneath the moon 
Would repent its envy vain, 
And the earth grow young again.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Winter', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45127/lines-written-among-the-euganean-hills,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,from Epipsychidion,"Emily, 
A ship is floating in the harbour now, 
A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow; 
There is a path on the sea's azure floor, 
No keel has ever plough'd that path before; 
The halcyons brood around the foamless isles; 
The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles; 
The merry mariners are bold and free: 
Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me? 
Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest 
Is a far Eden of the purple East; 
And we between her wings will sit, while Night, 
And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight, 
Our ministers, along the boundless Sea, 
Treading each other's heels, unheededly. 
It is an isle under Ionian skies, 
Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise, 
And, for the harbours are not safe and good, 
This land would have remain'd a solitude 
But for some pastoral people native there, 
Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air 
Draw the last spirit of the age of gold, 
Simple and spirited; innocent and bold. 
The blue Aegean girds this chosen home, 
With ever-changing sound and light and foam, 
Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar; 
And all the winds wandering along the shore 
Undulate with the undulating tide: 
There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide; 
And many a fountain, rivulet and pond, 
As clear as elemental diamond, 
Or serene morning air; and far beyond, 
The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer 
(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year) 
Pierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls 
Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls 
Illumining, with sound that never fails 
Accompany the noonday nightingales; 
And all the place is peopled with sweet airs; 
The light clear element which the isle wears 
Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers, 
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers, 
And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep; 
And from the moss violets and jonquils peep 
And dart their arrowy odour through the brain 
Till you might faint with that delicious pain. 
And every motion, odour, beam and tone, 
With that deep music is in unison: 
Which is a soul within the soul—they seem 
Like echoes of an antenatal dream. 
It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth and Sea, 
Cradled and hung in clear tranquillity; 
Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer, 
Wash'd by the soft blue Oceans of young air. 
It is a favour'd place. Famine or Blight, 
Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light 
Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they 
Sail onward far upon their fatal way: 
The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm 
To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm 
Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew, 
From which its fields and woods ever renew 
Their green and golden immortality. 
And from the sea there rise, and from the sky 
There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright, 
Veil after veil, each hiding some delight, 
Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside, 
Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride 
Glowing at once with love and loveliness, 
Blushes and trembles at its own excess: 
Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less 
Burns in the heart of this delicious isle, 
An atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile 
Unfolds itself, and may be felt not seen 
O'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green, 
Filling their bare and void interstices. 
But the chief marvel of the wilderness 
Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how 
None of the rustic island-people know: 
'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height 
It overtops the woods; but, for delight, 
Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime 
Had been invented, in the world's young prime, 
Rear'd it, a wonder of that simple time, 
An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house 
Made sacred to his sister and his spouse. 
It scarce seems now a wreck of human art, 
But, as it were, Titanic; in the heart 
Of Earth having assum'd its form, then grown 
Out of the mountains, from the living stone, 
Lifting itself in caverns light and high: 
For all the antique and learned imagery 
Has been eras'd, and in the place of it 
The ivy and the wild-vine interknit 
The volumes of their many-twining stems; 
Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems 
The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky 
Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery 
With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen, 
Or fragments of the day's intense serene; 
Working mosaic on their Parian floors. 
And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers 
And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem 
To sleep in one another's arms, and dream 
Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we 
Read in their smiles, and call reality. 
 
       This isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd 
Thee to be lady of the solitude. 
And I have fitted up some chambers there 
Looking towards the golden Eastern air, 
And level with the living winds, which flow 
Like waves above the living waves below. 
I have sent books and music there, and all 
Those instruments with which high Spirits call 
The future from its cradle, and the past 
Out of its grave, and make the present last 
In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, 
Folded within their own eternity. 
Our simple life wants little, and true taste 
Hires not the pale drudge Luxury to waste 
The scene it would adorn, and therefore still, 
Nature with all her children haunts the hill. 
The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet 
Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit 
Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance 
Between the quick bats in their twilight dance; 
The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight 
Before our gate, and the slow, silent night 
Is measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep. 
Be this our home in life, and when years heap 
Their wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay, 
Let us become the overhanging day, 
The living soul of this Elysian isle, 
Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile 
We two will rise, and sit, and walk together, 
Under the roof of blue Ionian weather, 
And wander in the meadows, or ascend 
The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend 
With lightest winds, to touch their paramour; 
Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore, 
Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea, 
Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— 
Possessing and possess'd by all that is 
Within that calm circumference of bliss, 
And by each other, till to love and live 
Be one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive 
Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep 
The moonlight of the expir'd night asleep, 
Through which the awaken'd day can never peep; 
A veil for our seclusion, close as night's, 
Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights; 
Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain 
Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again. 
And we will talk, until thought's melody 
Become too sweet for utterance, and it die 
In words, to live again in looks, which dart 
With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart, 
Harmonizing silence without a sound. 
Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound, 
And our veins beat together; and our lips 
With other eloquence than words, eclipse 
The soul that burns between them, and the wells 
Which boil under our being's inmost cells, 
The fountains of our deepest life, shall be 
Confus'd in Passion's golden purity, 
As mountain-springs under the morning sun. 
We shall become the same, we shall be one 
Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two? 
One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew, 
Till like two meteors of expanding flame, 
Those spheres instinct with it become the same, 
Touch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still 
Burning, yet ever inconsumable: 
In one another's substance finding food, 
Like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd 
To nourish their bright lives with baser prey, 
Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away: 
One hope within two wills, one will beneath 
Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death, 
One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality, 
And one annihilation. Woe is me! 
The winged words on which my soul would pierce 
Into the height of Love's rare Universe, 
Are chains of lead around its flight of fire— 
I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45119/epipsychidion,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,Julian and Maddalo,"(excerpt)

I rode one evening with Count Maddalo
Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow
Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand
Of hillocks, heap'd from ever-shifting sand,
Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,
Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,
Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,
Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,
Abandons; and no other object breaks
The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes
Broken and unrepair'd, and the tide makes
A narrow space of level sand thereon,
Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.
This ride was my delight. I love all waste
And solitary places; where we taste
The pleasure of believing what we see
Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:
And such was this wide ocean, and this shore
More barren than its billows; and yet more
Than all, with a remember'd friend I love
To ride as then I rode; for the winds drove
The living spray along the sunny air
Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,
Stripp'd to their depths by the awakening north;
And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth
Harmonizing with solitude, and sent
Into our hearts aëreal merriment.
So, as we rode, we talk'd; and the swift thought,
Winging itself with laughter, linger'd not,
But flew from brain to brain—such glee was ours,
Charg'd with light memories of remember'd hours,
None slow enough for sadness: till we came
Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.
This day had been cheerful but cold, and now
The sun was sinking, and the wind also.
Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be
Talk interrupted with such raillery
As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn
The thoughts it would extinguish: 'twas forlorn,
Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,
The devils held within the dales of Hell
Concerning God, freewill and destiny:
Of all that earth has been or yet may be,
All that vain men imagine or believe,
Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,
We descanted, and I (for ever still
Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)
Argu'd against despondency, but pride
Made my companion take the darker side.
The sense that he was greater than his kind
Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind
By gazing on its own exceeding light.
Meanwhile the sun paus'd ere it should alight,
Over the horizon of the mountains—Oh,
How beautiful is sunset, when the glow
Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,
Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!
Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towers
Of cities they encircle! It was ours
To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,
Just where we had dismounted, the Count's men
Were waiting for us with the gondola.
As those who pause on some delightful way
Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood
Looking upon the evening, and the flood
Which lay between the city and the shore,
Pav'd with the image of the sky.... The hoar
And aëry Alps towards the North appear'd
Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark rear'd
Between the East and West; and half the sky
Was roof'd with clouds of rich emblazonry
Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew
Down the steep West into a wondrous hue
Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent
Where the swift sun yet paus'd in his descent
Among the many-folded hills: they were
Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,
As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,
The likeness of a clump of peakèd isles—
And then—as if the Earth and Sea had been
Dissolv'd into one lake of fire, were seen
Those mountains towering as from waves of flame
Around the vaporous sun, from which there came
The inmost purple spirit of light, and made
Their very peaks transparent. ""Ere it fade,""
Said my companion, ""I will show you soon
A better station""—so, o'er the lagune
We glided; and from that funereal bark
I lean'd, and saw the city, and could mark
How from their many isles, in evening's gleam,
Its temples and its palaces did seem
Like fabrics of enchantment pil'd to Heaven.
I was about to speak, when—""We are even
Now at the point I meant,"" said Maddalo,
And bade the gondolieri cease to row.
""Look, Julian, on the west, and listen well
If you hear not a deep and heavy bell.""
I look'd, and saw between us and the sun
A building on an island; such a one
As age to age might add, for uses vile,
A windowless, deform'd and dreary pile;
And on the top an open tower, where hung
A bell, which in the radiance sway'd and swung;
We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:
The broad sun sunk behind it, and it toll'd
In strong and black relief. ""What we behold
Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,""
Said Maddalo, ""and ever at this hour
Those who may cross the water, hear that bell
Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,
To vespers."" ""As much skill as need to pray
In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they
To their stern Maker,"" I replied. ""O ho!
You talk as in years past,"" said Maddalo.
"" 'Tis strange men change not. You were ever still
Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel,
A wolf for the meek lambs—if you can't swim
Beware of Providence."" I look'd on him,
But the gay smile had faded in his eye.
""And such,"" he cried, ""is our mortality,
And this must be the emblem and the sign
Of what should be eternal and divine!
And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,
Hung in a heaven-illumin'd tower, must toll
Our thoughts and our desires to meet below
Round the rent heart and pray—as madmen do
For what? they know not—till the night of death,
As sunset that strange vision, severeth
Our memory from itself, and us from all
We sought and yet were baffled."" I recall
The sense of what he said, although I mar
The force of his expressions. The broad star
Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,
And the black bell became invisible,
And the red tower look'd gray, and all between
The churches, ships and palaces were seen
Huddled in gloom;—into the purple sea
The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.
We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola
Convey'd me to my lodgings by the way.

    The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:
Ere Maddalo arose, I call'd on him,
And whilst I waited with his child I play'd;
A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,
A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,
Graceful without design and unforeseeing,
With eyes—Oh speak not of her eyes!—which seem
Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam
With such deep meaning, as we never see
But in the human countenance: with me
She was a special favourite: I had nurs'd
Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first
To this bleak world; and she yet seem'd to know
On second sight her ancient playfellow,
Less chang'd than she was by six months or so;
For after her first shyness was worn out
We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,
When the Count enter'd. Salutations past—
""The word you spoke last night might well have cast
A darkness on my spirit—if man be
The passive thing you say, I should not see
Much harm in the religions and old saws
(Though I may never own such leaden laws)
Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:
Mine is another faith""—thus much I spoke
And noting he replied not, added: ""See
This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;
She spends a happy time with little care,
While we to such sick thoughts subjected are
As came on you last night. It is our will
That thus enchains us to permitted ill.
We might be otherwise. We might be all
We dream of happy, high, majestical.
Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek
But in our mind? and if we were not weak
Should we be less in deed than in desire?""
""Ay, if we were not weak—and we aspire
How vainly to be strong!"" said Maddalo:
""You talk Utopia."" ""It remains to know,""
I then rejoin'd, ""and those who try may find
How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;
Brittle perchance as straw.... We are assur'd
Much may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd,
Of what degrades and crushes us. We know
That we have power over ourselves to do
And suffer—what, we know not till we try;
But something nobler than to live and die:
So taught those kings of old philosophy
Who reign'd, before Religion made men blind;
And those who suffer with their suffering kind
Yet feel their faith, religion."" ""My dear friend,""
Said Maddalo, ""my judgement will not bend
To your opinion, though I think you might
Make such a system refutation-tight
As far as words go. I knew one like you
Who to this city came some months ago,
With whom I argu'd in this sort, and he
Is now gone mad—and so he answer'd me—
Poor fellow! but if you would like to go
We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show
How vain are such aspiring theories.""
""I hope to prove the induction otherwise,
And that a want of that true theory, still,
Which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things ill
Or in himself or others, has thus bow'd
His being. There are some by nature proud,
Who patient in all else demand but this—
To love and be belov'd with gentleness;
And being scorn'd, what wonder if they die
Some living death? this is not destiny
But man's own wilful ill.""

                                         As thus I spoke
Servants announc'd the gondola, and we
Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
Sail'd to the island where the madhouse stands.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45125/julian-and-maddalo,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,Lines Written in the Bay of Lerici,"She left me at the silent time
When the moon had ceas'd to climb
The azure path of Heaven's steep,
And like an albatross asleep,
Balanc'd on her wings of light,
Hover'd in the purple night,
Ere she sought her ocean nest
In the chambers of the West.
She left me, and I stay'd alone
Thinking over every tone
Which, though silent to the ear,
The enchanted heart could hear,
Like notes which die when born, but still
Haunt the echoes of the hill;
And feeling ever—oh, too much!—
The soft vibration of her touch,
As if her gentle hand, even now,
Lightly trembled on my brow;
And thus, although she absent were,
Memory gave me all of her
That even Fancy dares to claim:
Her presence had made weak and tame
All passions, and I lived alone
In the time which is our own;
The past and future were forgot,
As they had been, and would be, not.
But soon, the guardian angel gone,
The daemon reassum'd his throne
In my faint heart. I dare not speak
My thoughts, but thus disturb'd and weak
I sat and saw the vessels glide
Over the ocean bright and wide,
Like spirit-winged chariots sent
O'er some serenest element
For ministrations strange and far,
As if to some Elysian star
Sailed for drink to medicine
Such sweet and bitter pain as mine.
And the wind that wing'd their flight
From the land came fresh and light,
And the scent of winged flowers,
And the coolness of the hours
Of dew, and sweet warmth left by day,
Were scatter'd o'er the twinkling bay.
And the fisher with his lamp
And spear about the low rocks damp
Crept, and struck the fish which came
To worship the delusive flame.
Too happy they, whose pleasure sought
Extinguishes all sense and thought
Of the regret that pleasure leaves,
Destroying life alone, not peace!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Music', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45128/lines-written-in-the-bay-of-lerici,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,Ode to the West Wind,"I 
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, 
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead 
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing, 
 
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, 
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, 
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed 
 
The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low, 
Each like a corpse within its grave, until 
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow 
 
Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill 
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) 
With living hues and odours plain and hill: 
 
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; 
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear! 
 
II 
Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion, 
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed, 
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean, 
 
Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread 
On the blue surface of thine aëry surge, 
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head 
 
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge 
Of the horizon to the zenith's height, 
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge 
 
Of the dying year, to which this closing night 
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre, 
Vaulted with all thy congregated might 
 
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere 
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear! 
 
III 
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams 
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay, 
Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams, 
 
Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay, 
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers 
Quivering within the wave's intenser day, 
 
All overgrown with azure moss and flowers 
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou 
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers 
 
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below 
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear 
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know 
 
Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear, 
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear! 
 
IV 
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear; 
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee; 
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share 
 
The impulse of thy strength, only less free 
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even 
I were as in my boyhood, and could be 
 
The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven, 
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed 
Scarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven 
 
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need. 
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud! 
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed! 
 
A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd 
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud. 
 
V 
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is: 
What if my leaves are falling like its own! 
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies 
 
Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone, 
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce, 
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one! 
 
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe 
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth! 
And, by the incantation of this verse, 
 
Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth 
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind! 
Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth 
 
The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind, 
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?",ode,types/modes,"['Nature', 'Fall', 'Weather', 'Ode', 'Terza Rima']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45134/ode-to-the-west-wind,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,The Cloud,"I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
     From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
     In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
     The sweet buds every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
     As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
     And whiten the green plains under,
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
     And laugh as I pass in thunder.

 I sift the snow on the mountains below,
     And their great pines groan aghast;
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
     While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,
     Lightning my pilot sits;
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,
     It struggles and howls at fits;
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
     This pilot is guiding me,
Lured by the love of the genii that move
     In the depths of the purple sea;
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,
     Over the lakes and the plains,
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,
     The Spirit he loves remains;
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,
     Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

 The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,
     And his burning plumes outspread,
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,
     When the morning star shines dead;
As on the jag of a mountain crag,
     Which an earthquake rocks and swings,
An eagle alit one moment may sit
     In the light of its golden wings.
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,
     Its ardours of rest and of love,
And the crimson pall of eve may fall
     From the depth of Heaven above,
With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest,
     As still as a brooding dove.

 That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
     Whom mortals call the Moon,
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,
     By the midnight breezes strewn;
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,
     Which only the angels hear,
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,
     The stars peep behind her and peer;
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,
     Like a swarm of golden bees,
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,
     Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,
     Are each paved with the moon and these.

 I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,
     And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,
     When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,
     Over a torrent sea,
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,
     The mountains its columns be.
The triumphal arch through which I march
     With hurricane, fire, and snow,
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,
     Is the million-coloured bow;
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,
     While the moist Earth was laughing below.

 I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
     And the nursling of the Sky;
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
     I change, but I cannot die.
For after the rain when with never a stain
     The pavilion of Heaven is bare,
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
     Build up the blue dome of air,
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
     And out of the caverns of rain,
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
     I arise and unbuild it again.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Weather', 'Pastoral', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45117/the-cloud-56d2247bf4112,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,from Epipsychidion,"Emily, 
A ship is floating in the harbour now, 
A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow; 
There is a path on the sea's azure floor, 
No keel has ever plough'd that path before; 
The halcyons brood around the foamless isles; 
The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles; 
The merry mariners are bold and free: 
Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me? 
Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest 
Is a far Eden of the purple East; 
And we between her wings will sit, while Night, 
And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight, 
Our ministers, along the boundless Sea, 
Treading each other's heels, unheededly. 
It is an isle under Ionian skies, 
Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise, 
And, for the harbours are not safe and good, 
This land would have remain'd a solitude 
But for some pastoral people native there, 
Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air 
Draw the last spirit of the age of gold, 
Simple and spirited; innocent and bold. 
The blue Aegean girds this chosen home, 
With ever-changing sound and light and foam, 
Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar; 
And all the winds wandering along the shore 
Undulate with the undulating tide: 
There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide; 
And many a fountain, rivulet and pond, 
As clear as elemental diamond, 
Or serene morning air; and far beyond, 
The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer 
(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year) 
Pierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls 
Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls 
Illumining, with sound that never fails 
Accompany the noonday nightingales; 
And all the place is peopled with sweet airs; 
The light clear element which the isle wears 
Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers, 
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers, 
And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep; 
And from the moss violets and jonquils peep 
And dart their arrowy odour through the brain 
Till you might faint with that delicious pain. 
And every motion, odour, beam and tone, 
With that deep music is in unison: 
Which is a soul within the soul—they seem 
Like echoes of an antenatal dream. 
It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth and Sea, 
Cradled and hung in clear tranquillity; 
Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer, 
Wash'd by the soft blue Oceans of young air. 
It is a favour'd place. Famine or Blight, 
Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light 
Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they 
Sail onward far upon their fatal way: 
The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm 
To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm 
Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew, 
From which its fields and woods ever renew 
Their green and golden immortality. 
And from the sea there rise, and from the sky 
There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright, 
Veil after veil, each hiding some delight, 
Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside, 
Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride 
Glowing at once with love and loveliness, 
Blushes and trembles at its own excess: 
Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less 
Burns in the heart of this delicious isle, 
An atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile 
Unfolds itself, and may be felt not seen 
O'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green, 
Filling their bare and void interstices. 
But the chief marvel of the wilderness 
Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how 
None of the rustic island-people know: 
'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height 
It overtops the woods; but, for delight, 
Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime 
Had been invented, in the world's young prime, 
Rear'd it, a wonder of that simple time, 
An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house 
Made sacred to his sister and his spouse. 
It scarce seems now a wreck of human art, 
But, as it were, Titanic; in the heart 
Of Earth having assum'd its form, then grown 
Out of the mountains, from the living stone, 
Lifting itself in caverns light and high: 
For all the antique and learned imagery 
Has been eras'd, and in the place of it 
The ivy and the wild-vine interknit 
The volumes of their many-twining stems; 
Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems 
The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky 
Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery 
With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen, 
Or fragments of the day's intense serene; 
Working mosaic on their Parian floors. 
And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers 
And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem 
To sleep in one another's arms, and dream 
Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we 
Read in their smiles, and call reality. 
 
       This isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd 
Thee to be lady of the solitude. 
And I have fitted up some chambers there 
Looking towards the golden Eastern air, 
And level with the living winds, which flow 
Like waves above the living waves below. 
I have sent books and music there, and all 
Those instruments with which high Spirits call 
The future from its cradle, and the past 
Out of its grave, and make the present last 
In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, 
Folded within their own eternity. 
Our simple life wants little, and true taste 
Hires not the pale drudge Luxury to waste 
The scene it would adorn, and therefore still, 
Nature with all her children haunts the hill. 
The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet 
Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit 
Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance 
Between the quick bats in their twilight dance; 
The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight 
Before our gate, and the slow, silent night 
Is measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep. 
Be this our home in life, and when years heap 
Their wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay, 
Let us become the overhanging day, 
The living soul of this Elysian isle, 
Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile 
We two will rise, and sit, and walk together, 
Under the roof of blue Ionian weather, 
And wander in the meadows, or ascend 
The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend 
With lightest winds, to touch their paramour; 
Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore, 
Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea, 
Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— 
Possessing and possess'd by all that is 
Within that calm circumference of bliss, 
And by each other, till to love and live 
Be one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive 
Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep 
The moonlight of the expir'd night asleep, 
Through which the awaken'd day can never peep; 
A veil for our seclusion, close as night's, 
Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights; 
Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain 
Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again. 
And we will talk, until thought's melody 
Become too sweet for utterance, and it die 
In words, to live again in looks, which dart 
With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart, 
Harmonizing silence without a sound. 
Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound, 
And our veins beat together; and our lips 
With other eloquence than words, eclipse 
The soul that burns between them, and the wells 
Which boil under our being's inmost cells, 
The fountains of our deepest life, shall be 
Confus'd in Passion's golden purity, 
As mountain-springs under the morning sun. 
We shall become the same, we shall be one 
Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two? 
One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew, 
Till like two meteors of expanding flame, 
Those spheres instinct with it become the same, 
Touch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still 
Burning, yet ever inconsumable: 
In one another's substance finding food, 
Like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd 
To nourish their bright lives with baser prey, 
Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away: 
One hope within two wills, one will beneath 
Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death, 
One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality, 
And one annihilation. Woe is me! 
The winged words on which my soul would pierce 
Into the height of Love's rare Universe, 
Are chains of lead around its flight of fire— 
I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!",pastoral,types/modes,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45119/epipsychidion,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,Hymn of Pan,"From the forests and highlands 
         We come, we come; 
From the river-girt islands, 
         Where loud waves are dumb 
                Listening to my sweet pipings. 
The wind in the reeds and the rushes, 
         The bees on the bells of thyme, 
The birds on the myrtle bushes, 
         The cicale above in the lime, 
And the lizards below in the grass, 
Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was, 
                Listening to my sweet pipings. 
 
Liquid Peneus was flowing, 
         And all dark Tempe lay 
In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing 
         The light of the dying day, 
                Speeded by my sweet pipings. 
The Sileni, and Sylvans, and Fauns, 
         And the Nymphs of the woods and the waves, 
To the edge of the moist river-lawns, 
         And the brink of the dewy caves, 
And all that did then attend and follow, 
Were silent with love, as you now, Apollo, 
                With envy of my sweet pipings. 
 
I sang of the dancing stars, 
         I sang of the daedal Earth, 
And of Heaven, and the giant wars, 
         And Love, and Death, and Birth— 
                And then I chang'd my pipings, 
Singing how down the vale of Maenalus 
         I pursu'd a maiden and clasp'd a reed. 
Gods and men, we are all deluded thus! 
         It breaks in our bosom and then we bleed. 
All wept, as I think both ye now would, 
If envy or age had not frozen your blood,

Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats,"I 
       I weep for Adonais—he is dead! 
       Oh, weep for Adonais! though our tears 
       Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head! 
       And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years 
       To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers, 
       And teach them thine own sorrow, say: ""With me 
       Died Adonais; till the Future dares 
       Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be 
An echo and a light unto eternity!"" 
 
II 
       Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay, 
       When thy Son lay, pierc'd by the shaft which flies 
       In darkness? where was lorn Urania 
       When Adonais died? With veiled eyes, 
       'Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise 
       She sate, while one, with soft enamour'd breath, 
       Rekindled all the fading melodies, 
       With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath, 
He had adorn'd and hid the coming bulk of Death. 
 
III 
       Oh, weep for Adonais—he is dead! 
       Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep! 
       Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed 
       Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep 
       Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep; 
       For he is gone, where all things wise and fair 
       Descend—oh, dream not that the amorous Deep 
       Will yet restore him to the vital air; 
Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair. 
 
IV 
       Most musical of mourners, weep again! 
       Lament anew, Urania! He died, 
       Who was the Sire of an immortal strain, 
       Blind, old and lonely, when his country's pride, 
       The priest, the slave and the liberticide, 
       Trampled and mock'd with many a loathed rite 
       Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified, 
       Into the gulf of death; but his clear Sprite 
Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light. 
 
V 
       Most musical of mourners, weep anew! 
       Not all to that bright station dar'd to climb; 
       And happier they their happiness who knew, 
       Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time 
       In which suns perish'd; others more sublime, 
       Struck by the envious wrath of man or god, 
       Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime; 
       And some yet live, treading the thorny road, 
Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode. 
 
VI 
       But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perish'd, 
       The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew, 
       Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherish'd, 
       And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew; 
       Most musical of mourners, weep anew! 
       Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last, 
       The bloom, whose petals nipp'd before they blew 
       Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste; 
The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast. 
 
VII 
       To that high Capital, where kingly Death 
       Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay, 
       He came; and bought, with price of purest breath, 
       A grave among the eternal.—Come away! 
       Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day 
       Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still 
       He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay; 
       Awake him not! surely he takes his fill 
Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill. 
 
VIII 
       He will awake no more, oh, never more! 
       Within the twilight chamber spreads apace 
       The shadow of white Death, and at the door 
       Invisible Corruption waits to trace 
       His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place; 
       The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe 
       Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface 
       So fair a prey, till darkness and the law 
Of change shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw. 
 
IX 
       Oh, weep for Adonais! The quick Dreams, 
       The passion-winged Ministers of thought, 
       Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams 
       Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught 
       The love which was its music, wander not— 
       Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain, 
       But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lot 
       Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain, 
They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again. 
 
X 
       And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head, 
       And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries, 
       ""Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead; 
       See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes, 
       Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies 
       A tear some Dream has loosen'd from his brain."" 
       Lost Angel of a ruin'd Paradise! 
       She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stain 
She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain. 
 
XI 
       One from a lucid urn of starry dew 
       Wash'd his light limbs as if embalming them; 
       Another clipp'd her profuse locks, and threw 
       The wreath upon him, like an anadem, 
       Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem; 
       Another in her wilful grief would break 
       Her bow and winged reeds, as if to stem 
       A greater loss with one which was more weak; 
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek. 
 
XII 
       Another Splendour on his mouth alit, 
       That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath 
       Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit, 
       And pass into the panting heart beneath 
       With lightning and with music: the damp death 
       Quench'd its caress upon his icy lips; 
       And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath 
       Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips, 
It flush'd through his pale limbs, and pass'd to its eclipse. 
 
XIII 
       And others came . . . Desires and Adorations, 
       Winged Persuasions and veil'd Destinies, 
       Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations 
       Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies; 
       And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs, 
       And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam 
       Of her own dying smile instead of eyes, 
       Came in slow pomp; the moving pomp might seem 
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream. 
 
XIV 
       All he had lov'd, and moulded into thought, 
       From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound, 
       Lamented Adonais. Morning sought 
       Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound, 
       Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground, 
       Dimm'd the aëreal eyes that kindle day; 
       Afar the melancholy thunder moan'd, 
       Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay, 
And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay. 
 
XV 
       Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains, 
       And feeds her grief with his remember'd lay, 
       And will no more reply to winds or fountains, 
       Or amorous birds perch'd on the young green spray, 
       Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day; 
       Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear 
       Than those for whose disdain she pin'd away 
       Into a shadow of all sounds: a drear 
Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear. 
 
XVI 
       Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down 
       Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were, 
       Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown, 
       For whom should she have wak'd the sullen year? 
       To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear 
       Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both 
       Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere 
       Amid the faint companions of their youth, 
With dew all turn'd to tears; odour, to sighing ruth. 
 
XVII 
       Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale 
       Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain; 
       Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale 
       Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain 
       Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain, 
       Soaring and screaming round her empty nest, 
       As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain 
       Light on his head who pierc'd thy innocent breast, 
And scar'd the angel soul that was its earthly guest! 
 
XVIII 
       Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone, 
       But grief returns with the revolving year; 
       The airs and streams renew their joyous tone; 
       The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear; 
       Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier; 
       The amorous birds now pair in every brake, 
       And build their mossy homes in field and brere; 
       And the green lizard, and the golden snake, 
Like unimprison'd flames, out of their trance awake. 
 
XIX 
       Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean 
       A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst 
       As it has ever done, with change and motion, 
       From the great morning of the world when first 
       God dawn'd on Chaos; in its stream immers'd, 
       The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light; 
       All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst; 
       Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight, 
The beauty and the joy of their renewed might. 
 
XX 
       The leprous corpse, touch'd by this spirit tender, 
       Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath; 
       Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour 
       Is chang'd to fragrance, they illumine death 
       And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath; 
       Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows 
       Be as a sword consum'd before the sheath 
       By sightless lightning?—the intense atom glows 
A moment, then is quench'd in a most cold repose. 
 
XXI 
       Alas! that all we lov'd of him should be, 
       But for our grief, as if it had not been, 
       And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me! 
       Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene 
       The actors or spectators? Great and mean 
       Meet mass'd in death, who lends what life must borrow. 
       As long as skies are blue, and fields are green, 
       Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow, 
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow. 
 
XXII 
       He will awake no more, oh, never more! 
       ""Wake thou,"" cried Misery, ""childless Mother, rise 
       Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core, 
       A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs."" 
       And all the Dreams that watch'd Urania's eyes, 
       And all the Echoes whom their sister's song 
       Had held in holy silence, cried: ""Arise!"" 
       Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung, 
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung. 
 
XXIII 
       She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs 
       Out of the East, and follows wild and drear 
       The golden Day, which, on eternal wings, 
       Even as a ghost abandoning a bier, 
       Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear 
       So struck, so rous'd, so rapt Urania; 
       So sadden'd round her like an atmosphere 
       Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way 
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay. 
 
XXIV 
       Out of her secret Paradise she sped, 
       Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel, 
       And human hearts, which to her aery tread 
       Yielding not, wounded the invisible 
       Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell: 
       And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they, 
       Rent the soft Form they never could repel, 
       Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May, 
Pav'd with eternal flowers that undeserving way. 
 
XXV 
       In the death-chamber for a moment Death, 
       Sham'd by the presence of that living Might, 
       Blush'd to annihilation, and the breath 
       Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light 
       Flash'd through those limbs, so late her dear delight. 
       ""Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless, 
       As silent lightning leaves the starless night! 
       Leave me not!"" cried Urania: her distress 
Rous'd Death: Death rose and smil'd, and met her vain caress. 
 
XXVI 
       ""Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again; 
       Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live; 
       And in my heartless breast and burning brain 
       That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive, 
       With food of saddest memory kept alive, 
       Now thou art dead, as if it were a part 
       Of thee, my Adonais! I would give 
       All that I am to be as thou now art! 
But I am chain'd to Time, and cannot thence depart! 
 
XXVII 
       ""O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert, 
       Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men 
       Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart 
       Dare the unpastur'd dragon in his den? 
       Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then 
       Wisdom the mirror'd shield, or scorn the spear? 
       Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when 
       Thy spirit should have fill'd its crescent sphere, 
The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer. 
 
XXVIII 
       ""The herded wolves, bold only to pursue; 
       The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead; 
       The vultures to the conqueror's banner true 
       Who feed where Desolation first has fed, 
       And whose wings rain contagion; how they fled, 
       When, like Apollo, from his golden bow 
       The Pythian of the age one arrow sped 
       And smil'd! The spoilers tempt no second blow, 
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low. 
 
XXIX 
       ""The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn; 
       He sets, and each ephemeral insect then 
       Is gather'd into death without a dawn, 
       And the immortal stars awake again; 
       So is it in the world of living men: 
       A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight 
       Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when 
       It sinks, the swarms that dimm'd or shar'd its light 
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night."" 
 
XXX 
       Thus ceas'd she: and the mountain shepherds came, 
       Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent; 
       The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame 
       Over his living head like Heaven is bent, 
       An early but enduring monument, 
       Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song 
       In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent 
       The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong, 
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue. 
 
XXXI 
       Midst others of less note, came one frail Form, 
       A phantom among men; companionless 
       As the last cloud of an expiring storm 
       Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess, 
       Had gaz'd on Nature's naked loveliness, 
       Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray 
       With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness, 
       And his own thoughts, along that rugged way, 
Pursu'd, like raging hounds, their father and their prey. 
 
XXXII 
       A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift— 
       A Love in desolation mask'd—a Power 
       Girt round with weakness—it can scarce uplift 
       The weight of the superincumbent hour; 
       It is a dying lamp, a falling shower, 
       A breaking billow; even whilst we speak 
       Is it not broken? On the withering flower 
       The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek 
The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break. 
 
XXXIII 
       His head was bound with pansies overblown, 
       And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue; 
       And a light spear topp'd with a cypress cone, 
       Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew 
       Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew, 
       Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart 
       Shook the weak hand that grasp'd it; of that crew 
       He came the last, neglected and apart; 
A herd-abandon'd deer struck by the hunter's dart. 
 
XXXIV 
       All stood aloof, and at his partial moan 
       Smil'd through their tears; well knew that gentle band 
       Who in another's fate now wept his own, 
       As in the accents of an unknown land 
       He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scann'd 
       The Stranger's mien, and murmur'd: ""Who art thou?"" 
       He answer'd not, but with a sudden hand 
       Made bare his branded and ensanguin'd brow, 
Which was like Cain's or Christ's—oh! that it should be so! 
 
XXXV 
       What softer voice is hush'd over the dead? 
       Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown? 
       What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed, 
       In mockery of monumental stone, 
       The heavy heart heaving without a moan? 
       If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise, 
       Taught, sooth'd, lov'd, honour'd the departed one, 
       Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs, 
The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice. 
 
XXXVI 
       Our Adonais has drunk poison—oh! 
       What deaf and viperous murderer could crown 
       Life's early cup with such a draught of woe? 
       The nameless worm would now itself disown: 
       It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone 
       Whose prelude held all envy, hate and wrong, 
       But what was howling in one breast alone, 
       Silent with expectation of the song, 
Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung. 
 
XXXVII 
       Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame! 
       Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me, 
       Thou noteless blot on a remember'd name! 
       But be thyself, and know thyself to be! 
       And ever at thy season be thou free 
       To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow; 
       Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee; 
       Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow, 
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt—as now. 
 
XXXVIII 
       Nor let us weep that our delight is fled 
       Far from these carrion kites that scream below; 
       He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead; 
       Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now. 
       Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow 
       Back to the burning fountain whence it came, 
       A portion of the Eternal, which must glow 
       Through time and change, unquenchably the same, 
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame. 
 
XXXIX 
       Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep, 
       He hath awaken'd from the dream of life; 
       'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep 
       With phantoms an unprofitable strife, 
       And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife 
       Invulnerable nothings.  We decay 
       Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief 
       Convulse us and consume us day by day, 
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay. 
 
XL 
       He has outsoar'd the shadow of our night; 
       Envy and calumny and hate and pain, 
       And that unrest which men miscall delight, 
       Can touch him not and torture not again; 
       From the contagion of the world's slow stain 
       He is secure, and now can never mourn 
       A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain; 
       Nor, when the spirit's self has ceas'd to burn, 
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn. 
 
XLI 
       He lives, he wakes—'tis Death is dead, not he; 
       Mourn not for Adonais. Thou young Dawn, 
       Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee 
       The spirit thou lamentest is not gone; 
       Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan! 
       Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air, 
       Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown 
       O'er the abandon'd Earth, now leave it bare 
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair! 
 
XLII 
       He is made one with Nature: there is heard 
       His voice in all her music, from the moan 
       Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird; 
       He is a presence to be felt and known 
       In darkness and in light, from herb and stone, 
       Spreading itself where'er that Power may move 
       Which has withdrawn his being to its own; 
       Which wields the world with never-wearied love, 
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above. 
 
XLIII 
       He is a portion of the loveliness 
       Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear 
       His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress 
       Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there 
       All new successions to the forms they wear; 
       Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight 
       To its own likeness, as each mass may bear; 
       And bursting in its beauty and its might 
From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light. 
 
XLIV 
       The splendours of the firmament of time 
       May be eclips'd, but are extinguish'd not; 
       Like stars to their appointed height they climb, 
       And death is a low mist which cannot blot 
       The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought 
       Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair, 
       And love and life contend in it for what 
       Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there 
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air. 
 
XLV 
       The inheritors of unfulfill'd renown 
       Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought, 
       Far in the Unapparent. Chatterton 
       Rose pale, his solemn agony had not 
       Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought 
       And as he fell and as he liv'd and lov'd 
       Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot, 
       Arose; and Lucan, by his death approv'd: 
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reprov'd. 
 
XLVI 
       And many more, whose names on Earth are dark, 
       But whose transmitted effluence cannot die 
       So long as fire outlives the parent spark, 
       Rose, rob'd in dazzling immortality. 
       ""Thou art become as one of us,"" they cry, 
       ""It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long 
       Swung blind in unascended majesty, 
       Silent alone amid a Heaven of Song. 
Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!"" 
 
XLVII 
       Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth, 
       Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright. 
       Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth; 
       As from a centre, dart thy spirit's light 
       Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might 
       Satiate the void circumference: then shrink 
       Even to a point within our day and night; 
       And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink 
When hope has kindled hope, and lur'd thee to the brink. 
 
XLVIII 
       Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre, 
       Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought 
       That ages, empires and religions there 
       Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought; 
       For such as he can lend—they borrow not 
       Glory from those who made the world their prey; 
       And he is gather'd to the kings of thought 
       Who wag'd contention with their time's decay, 
And of the past are all that cannot pass away. 
 
XLIX 
       Go thou to Rome—at once the Paradise, 
       The grave, the city, and the wilderness; 
       And where its wrecks like shatter'd mountains rise, 
       And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress 
       The bones of Desolation's nakedness 
       Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead 
       Thy footsteps to a slope of green access 
       Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead 
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread; 
 
L 
       And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time 
       Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand; 
       And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime, 
       Pavilioning the dust of him who plann'd 
       This refuge for his memory, doth stand 
       Like flame transform'd to marble; and beneath, 
       A field is spread, on which a newer band 
       Have pitch'd in Heaven's smile their camp of death, 
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguish'd breath. 
 
LI 
       Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet 
       To have outgrown the sorrow which consign'd 
       Its charge to each; and if the seal is set, 
       Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind, 
       Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find 
       Thine own well full, if thou returnest home, 
       Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind 
       Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb. 
What Adonais is, why fear we to become? 
 
LII 
       The One remains, the many change and pass; 
       Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly; 
       Life, like a dome of many-colour'd glass, 
       Stains the white radiance of Eternity, 
       Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die, 
       If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek! 
       Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky, 
       Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak 
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak. 
 
LIII 
       Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart? 
       Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here 
       They have departed; thou shouldst now depart! 
       A light is pass'd from the revolving year, 
       And man, and woman; and what still is dear 
       Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither. 
       The soft sky smiles, the low wind whispers near: 
       'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither, 
No more let Life divide what Death can join together. 
 
LIV 
       That Light whose smile kindles the Universe, 
       That Beauty in which all things work and move, 
       That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse 
       Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love 
       Which through the web of being blindly wove 
       By man and beast and earth and air and sea, 
       Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of 
       The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me, 
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality. 
 
LV 
       The breath whose might I have invok'd in song 
       Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven, 
       Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng 
       Whose sails were never to the tempest given; 
       The massy earth and sphered skies are riven! 
       I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar; 
       Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven, 
       The soul of Adonais, like a star, 
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45112/adonais-an-elegy-on-the-death-of-john-keats,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,from Queen Mab: Part VI,"(excerpt)

""Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light, 
Of which yon earth is one, is wide diffus'd 
A Spirit of activity and life, 
That knows no term, cessation, or decay; 
That fades not when the lamp of earthly life, 
Extinguish'd in the dampness of the grave, 
Awhile there slumbers, more than when the babe 
In the dim newness of its being feels 
The impulses of sublunary things, 
And all is wonder to unpractis'd sense: 
But, active, steadfast and eternal, still 
Guides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest roars, 
Cheers in the day, breathes in the balmy groves, 
Strengthens in health, and poisons in disease; 
And in the storm of change, that ceaselessly 
Rolls round the eternal universe and shakes 
Its undecaying battlement, presides, 
Apportioning with irresistible law 
The place each spring of its machine shall fill; 
So that when waves on waves tumultuous heap 
Confusion to the clouds, and fiercely driven 
Heaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords, 
Whilst, to the eye of shipwreck'd mariner, 
Lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock, 
All seems unlink'd contingency and chance, 
No atom of this turbulence fulfils 
A vague and unnecessitated task, 
Or acts but as it must and ought to act. 
Even the minutest molecule of light, 
That in an April sunbeam's fleeting glow 
Fulfils its destin'd, though invisible work, 
The universal Spirit guides; nor less, 
When merciless ambition, or mad zeal, 
Has led two hosts of dupes to battlefield, 
That, blind, they there may dig each other's graves, 
And call the sad work glory, does it rule 
All passions: not a thought, a will, an act, 
No working of the tyrant's moody mind, 
Nor one misgiving of the slaves who boast 
Their servitude to hide the shame they feel, 
Nor the events enchaining every will, 
That from the depths of unrecorded time 
Have drawn all-influencing virtue, pass 
Unrecogniz'd or unforeseen by thee, 
Soul of the Universe! eternal spring 
Of life and death, of happiness and woe, 
Of all that chequers the phantasmal scene 
That floats before our eyes in wavering light, 
Which gleams but on the darkness of our prison, 
       Whose chains and massy walls 
       We feel, but cannot see. 
 
""Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power, 
Necessity! thou mother of the world! 
Unlike the God of human error, thou 
Requir'st no prayers or praises; the caprice 
Of man's weak will belongs no more to thee 
Than do the changeful passions of his breast 
To thy unvarying harmony: the slave, 
Whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world, 
And the good man, who lifts with virtuous pride 
His being in the sight of happiness 
That springs from his own works; the poison-tree, 
Beneath whose shade all life is wither'd up, 
And the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords 
A temple where the vows of happy love 
Are register'd, are equal in thy sight: 
No love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge 
And favouritism, and worst desire of fame 
Thou know'st not: all that the wide world contains 
Are but thy passive instruments, and thou 
Regard'st them all with an impartial eye, 
Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel, 
         Because thou hast not human sense, 
         Because thou art not human mind. 
 
         ""Yes! when the sweeping storm of time 
Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruin'd fanes 
And broken altars of the almighty Fiend 
Whose name usurps thy honours, and the blood 
Through centuries clotted there has floated down 
The tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live 
Unchangeable! A shrine is rais'd to thee, 
         Which, nor the tempest-breath of time, 
         Nor the interminable flood 
         Over earth's slight pageant rolling, 
                Availeth to destroy— 
The sensitive extension of the world. 
         That wondrous and eternal fane, 
Where pain and pleasure, good and evil join, 
To do the will of strong necessity, 
         And life, in multitudinous shapes, 
Still pressing forward where no term can be, 
         Like hungry and unresting flame 
Curls round the eternal columns of its strength.""",blank verse,meters,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45137/queen-mab-part-vi,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,"Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude","Nondum amabam, et amare amabam, quaerebam quid amarem, amans amare.— 
 Confess. St. August.

Earth, ocean, air, belovèd brotherhood! 
If our great Mother has imbued my soul 
With aught of natural piety to feel 
Your love, and recompense the boon with mine; 
If dewy morn, and odorous noon, and even, 
With sunset and its gorgeous ministers, 
And solemn midnight's tingling silentness; 
If autumn's hollow sighs in the sere wood, 
And winter robing with pure snow and crowns 
Of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs; 
If spring's voluptuous pantings when she breathes 
Her first sweet kisses, have been dear to me; 
If no bright bird, insect, or gentle beast 
I consciously have injured, but still loved 
And cherished these my kindred; then forgive 
This boast, belovèd brethren, and withdraw 
No portion of your wonted favour now! 
 
         Mother of this unfathomable world! 
Favour my solemn song, for I have loved 
Thee ever, and thee only; I have watched 
Thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, 
And my heart ever gazes on the depth 
Of thy deep mysteries. I have made my bed 
In charnels and on coffins, where black death 
Keeps record of the trophies won from thee, 
Hoping to still these obstinate questionings 
Of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost 
Thy messenger, to render up the tale 
Of what we are. In lone and silent hours, 
When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, 
Like an inspired and desperate alchymist 
Staking his very life on some dark hope, 
Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks 
With my most innocent love, until strange tears 
Uniting with those breathless kisses, made 
Such magic as compels the charmèd night 
To render up thy charge:...and, though ne'er yet 
Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary, 
Enough from incommunicable dream, 
And twilight phantasms, and deep noon-day thought, 
Has shone within me, that serenely now 
And moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre 
Suspended in the solitary dome 
Of some mysterious and deserted fane, 
I wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain 
May modulate with murmurs of the air, 
And motions of the forests and the sea, 
And voice of living beings, and woven hymns 
Of night and day, and the deep heart of man. 
 
         There was a Poet whose untimely tomb 
No human hands with pious reverence reared, 
But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds 
Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid 
Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:— 
A lovely youth,—no mourning maiden decked 
With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath, 
The lone couch of his everlasting sleep:— 
Gentle, and brave, and generous,—no lorn bard 
Breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh: 
He lived, he died, he sung, in solitude. 
Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes, 
And virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined 
And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes. 
The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn, 
And Silence, too enamoured of that voice, 
Locks its mute music in her rugged cell. 
 
         By solemn vision, and bright silver dream, 
His infancy was nurtured. Every sight 
And sound from the vast earth and ambient air, 
Sent to his heart its choicest impulses. 
The fountains of divine philosophy 
Fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great, 
Or good, or lovely, which the sacred past 
In truth or fable consecrates, he felt 
And knew. When early youth had past, he left 
His cold fireside and alienated home 
To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands. 
Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness 
Has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought 
With his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men, 
His rest and food. Nature's most secret steps 
He like her shadow has pursued, where'er 
The red volcano overcanopies 
Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice 
With burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes 
On black bare pointed islets ever beat 
With sluggish surge, or where the secret caves 
Rugged and dark, winding among the springs 
Of fire and poison, inaccessible 
To avarice or pride, their starry domes 
Of diamond and of gold expand above 
Numberless and immeasurable halls, 
Frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines 
Of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite. 
Nor had that scene of ampler majesty 
Than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven 
And the green earth lost in his heart its claims 
To love and wonder; he would linger long 
In lonesome vales, making the wild his home, 
Until the doves and squirrels would partake 
From his innocuous hand his bloodless food, 
Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks, 
And the wild antelope, that starts whene'er 
The dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend 
Her timid steps to gaze upon a form 
More graceful than her own. 
 
                                                His wandering step 
Obedient to high thoughts, has visited 
The awful ruins of the days of old: 
Athens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste 
Where stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers 
Of Babylon, the eternal pyramids, 
Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange 
Sculptured on alabaster obelisk, 
Or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphynx, 
Dark Æthiopia in her desert hills 
Conceals. Among the ruined temples there, 
Stupendous columns, and wild images 
Of more than man, where marble daemons watch 
The Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men 
Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, 
He lingered, poring on memorials 
Of the world's youth, through the long burning day 
Gazed on those speechless shapes, nor, when the moon 
Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades 
Suspended he that task, but ever gazed 
And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind 
Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw 
The thrilling secrets of the birth of time. 
 
         Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food, 
Her daily portion, from her father's tent, 
And spread her matting for his couch, and stole 
From duties and repose to tend his steps:— 
Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe 
To speak her love:—and watched his nightly sleep, 
Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips 
Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath 
Of innocent dreams arose: then, when red morn 
Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home 
Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned. 
 
         The Poet wandering on, through Arabie 
And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, 
And o'er the aërial mountains which pour down 
Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, 
In joy and exultation held his way; 
Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within 
Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine 
Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, 
Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched 
His languid limbs. A vision on his sleep 
There came, a dream of hopes that never yet 
Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veilèd maid 
Sate near him, talking in low solemn tones. 
Her voice was like the voice of his own soul 
Heard in the calm of thought; its music long, 
Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held 
His inmost sense suspended in its web 
Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues. 
Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme, 
And lofty hopes of divine liberty, 
Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, 
Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood 
Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame 
A permeating fire: wild numbers then 
She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs 
Subdued by its own pathos: her fair hands 
Were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp 
Strange symphony, and in their branching veins 
The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale. 
The beating of her heart was heard to fill 
The pauses of her music, and her breath 
Tumultuously accorded with those fits 
Of intermitted song. Sudden she rose, 
As if her heart impatiently endured 
Its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned, 
And saw by the warm light of their own life 
Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil 
Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare, 
Her dark locks floating in the breath of night, 
Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips 
Outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly. 
His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess 
Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled 
His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet 
Her panting bosom:...she drew back a while, 
Then, yielding to the irresistible joy, 
With frantic gesture and short breathless cry 
Folded his frame in her dissolving arms. 
Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night 
Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep, 
Like a dark flood suspended in its course 
Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain. 
 
         Roused by the shock he started from his trance— 
The cold white light of morning, the blue moon 
Low in the west, the clear and garish hills, 
The distinct valley and the vacant woods, 
Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled 
The hues of heaven that canopied his bower 
Of yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep, 
The mystery and the majesty of Earth, 
The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes 
Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly 
As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven. 
The spirit of sweet human love has sent 
A vision to the sleep of him who spurned 
Her choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues 
Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade; 
He overleaps the bounds. Alas! Alas! 
Were limbs and breath and being intertwined 
Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, for ever lost, 
In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep, 
That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death 
Conduct to thy mysterious paradise, 
O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds, 
And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake, 
Lead only to a black and watery depth, 
While death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung, 
Where every shade which the foul grave exhales 
Hides its dead eye from the detested day, 
Conduct, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms? 
This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart, 
The insatiate hope which it awakened stung 
His brain even like despair. 
 
                                              While daylight held 
The sky, the Poet kept mute conference 
With his still soul. At night the passion came, 
Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream, 
And shook him from his rest, and led him forth 
Into the darkness.—As an eagle grasped 
In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast 
Burn with the poison, and precipitates 
Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, 
Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight 
O'er the wide aëry wilderness: thus driven 
By the bright shadow of that lovely dream, 
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, 
Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells, 
Startling with careless step the moonlight snake, 
He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight, 
Shedding the mockery of its vital hues 
Upon his cheek of death. He wandered on 
Till vast Aornos, seen from Petra's steep, 
Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud; 
Through Balk, and where the desolated tombs 
Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind 
Their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on, 
Day after day a weary waste of hours, 
Bearing within his life the brooding care 
That ever fed on its decaying flame. 
And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair 
Sered by the autumn of strange suffering 
Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand 
Hung like dead bone within its withered skin; 
Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone 
As in a furnace burning secretly 
From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers, 
Who ministered with human charity 
His human wants, beheld with wondering awe 
Their fleeting visitant. The mountaineer, 
Encountering on some dizzy precipice 
That spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of wind 
With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet 
Disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused 
In its career: the infant would conceal 
His troubled visage in his mother's robe 
In terror at the glare of those wild eyes, 
To remember their strange light in many a dream 
Of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught 
By nature, would interpret half the woe 
That wasted him, would call him with false names 
Brother, and friend, would press his pallid hand 
At parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path 
Of his departure from their father's door. 
 
         At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore 
He paused, a wide and melancholy waste 
Of putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged 
His steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there, 
Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds. 
It rose as he approached, and with strong wings 
Scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course 
High over the immeasurable main. 
His eyes pursued its flight.—""Thou hast a home, 
Beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home, 
Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck 
With thine, and welcome thy return with eyes 
Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy. 
And what am I that I should linger here, 
With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes, 
Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned 
To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers 
In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven 
That echoes not my thoughts?"" A gloomy smile 
Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips. 
For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly 
Its precious charge, and silent death exposed, 
Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure, 
With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms. 
 
         Startled by his own thoughts he looked around. 
There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight 
Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind. 
A little shallop floating near the shore 
Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze. 
It had been long abandoned, for its sides 
Gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints 
Swayed with the undulations of the tide. 
A restless impulse urged him to embark 
And meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste; 
For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves 
The slimy caverns of the populous deep. 
 
         The day was fair and sunny: sea and sky 
Drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind 
Swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves. 
Following his eager soul, the wanderer 
Leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft 
On the bare mast, and took his lonely seat, 
And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea 
Like a torn cloud before the hurricane. 
 
         As one that in a silver vision floats 
Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds 
Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly 
Along the dark and ruffled waters fled 
The straining boat.—A whirlwind swept it on, 
With fierce gusts and precipitating force, 
Through the white ridges of the chafèd sea. 
The waves arose. Higher and higher still 
Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge 
Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp. 
Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war 
Of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast 
Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven 
With dark obliterating course, he sate: 
As if their genii were the ministers 
Appointed to conduct him to the light 
Of those belovèd eyes, the Poet sate 
Holding the steady helm. Evening came on, 
The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues 
High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray 
That canopied his path o'er the waste deep; 
Twilight, ascending slowly from the east, 
Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks 
O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day; 
Night followed, clad with stars. On every side 
More horribly the multitudinous streams 
Of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war 
Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock 
The calm and spangled sky. The little boat 
Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam 
Down the steep cataract of a wintry river; 
Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave; 
Now leaving far behind the bursting mass 
That fell, convulsing ocean. Safely fled— 
As if that frail and wasted human form, 
Had been an elemental god. 
 
                                              At midnight 
The moon arose: and lo! the ethereal cliffs 
Of Caucasus, whose icy summits shone 
Among the stars like sunlight, and around 
Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves 
Bursting and eddying irresistibly 
Rage and resound for ever.—Who shall save?— 
The boat fled on,—the boiling torrent drove,— 
The crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms, 
The shattered mountain overhung the sea, 
And faster still, beyond all human speed, 
Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave, 
The little boat was driven. A cavern there 
Yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths 
Ingulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on 
With unrelaxing speed.—""Vision and Love!"" 
The Poet cried aloud, ""I have beheld 
The path of thy departure. Sleep and death 
Shall not divide us long!"" 
 
                                              The boat pursued 
The windings of the cavern. Daylight shone 
At length upon that gloomy river's flow; 
Now, where the fiercest war among the waves 
Is calm, on the unfathomable stream 
The boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven, 
Exposed those black depths to the azure sky, 
Ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell 
Even to the base of Caucasus, with sound 
That shook the everlasting rocks, the mass 
Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm; 
Stair above stair the eddying waters rose, 
Circling immeasurably fast, and laved 
With alternating dash the gnarlèd roots 
Of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms 
In darkness over it. I' the midst was left, 
Reflecting, yet distorting every cloud, 
A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm. 
Seized by the sway of the ascending stream, 
With dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round, 
Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose, 
Till on the verge of the extremest curve, 
Where, through an opening of the rocky bank, 
The waters overflow, and a smooth spot 
Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides 
Is left, the boat paused shuddering.—Shall it sink 
Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress 
Of that resistless gulf embosom it? 
Now shall it fall?—A wandering stream of wind, 
Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail, 
And, lo! with gentle motion, between banks 
Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream, 
Beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark! 
The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar, 
With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods. 
Where the embowering trees recede, and leave 
A little space of green expanse, the cove 
Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers 
For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes, 
Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave 
Of the boat's motion marred their pensive task, 
Which nought but vagrant bird, or wanton wind, 
Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay 
Had e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed 
To deck with their bright hues his withered hair, 
But on his heart its solitude returned, 
And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid 
In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame 
Had yet performed its ministry: it hung 
Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud 
Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods 
Of night close over it. 
 
                                              The noonday sun 
Now shone upon the forest, one vast mass 
Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence 
A narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves 
Scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks 
Mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever. 
The meeting boughs and implicated leaves 
Wove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as led 
By love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death, 
He sought in Nature's dearest haunt, some bank 
Her cradle, and his sepulchre. More dark 
And dark the shades accumulate. The oak, 
Expanding its immense and knotty arms, 
Embraces the light beech. The pyramids 
Of the tall cedar overarching, frame 
Most solemn domes within, and far below, 
Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky, 
The ash and the acacia floating hang 
Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed 
In rainbow and in fire, the parasites, 
Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around 
The grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes, 
With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles, 
Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love, 
These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs 
Uniting their close union; the woven leaves 
Make net-work of the dark blue light of day, 
And the night's noontide clearness, mutable 
As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns 
Beneath these canopies extend their swells, 
Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms 
Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen 
Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine, 
A soul-dissolving odour, to invite 
To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell, 
Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep 
Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades, 
Like vaporous shapes half seen; beyond, a well, 
Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave, 
Images all the woven boughs above, 
And each depending leaf, and every speck 
Of azure sky, darting between their chasms; 
Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves 
Its portraiture, but some inconstant star 
Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair, 
Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon, 
Or gorgeous insect floating motionless, 
Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings 
Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon. 
 
         Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld 
Their own wan light through the reflected lines 
Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth 
Of that still fountain; as the human heart, 
Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave, 
Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard 
The motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung 
Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel 
An unaccustomed presence, and the sound 
Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs 
Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed 
To stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes 
Of shadowy silver or enshrining light, 
Borrowed from aught the visible world affords 
Of grace, or majesty, or mystery;— 
But, undulating woods, and silent well, 
And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom 
Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming, 
Held commune with him, as if he and it 
Were all that was,—only... when his regard 
Was raised by intense pensiveness,... two eyes, 
Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought, 
And seemed with their serene and azure smiles 
To beckon him. 
 
                                              Obedient to the light 
That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing 
The windings of the dell.—The rivulet 
Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine 
Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell 
Among the moss, with hollow harmony 
Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones 
It danced; like childhood laughing as it went: 
Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept, 
Reflecting every herb and drooping bud 
That overhung its quietness.—""O stream! 
Whose source is inaccessibly profound, 
Whither do thy mysterious waters tend? 
Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness, 
Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs, 
Thy searchless fountain, and invisible course 
Have each their type in me: and the wide sky, 
And measureless ocean may declare as soon 
What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud 
Contains thy waters, as the universe 
Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched 
Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste 
I' the passing wind!"" 
 
                                              Beside the grassy shore 
Of the small stream he went; he did impress 
On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught 
Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one 
Roused by some joyous madness from the couch 
Of fever, he did move; yet, not like him, 
Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame 
Of his frail exultation shall be spent, 
He must descend. With rapid steps he went 
Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow 
Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now 
The forest's solemn canopies were changed 
For the uniform and lightsome evening sky. 
Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed 
The struggling brook: tall spires of windlestrae 
Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope, 
And nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines 
Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots 
The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here, 
Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away, 
The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin 
And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes 
Had shone, gleam stony orbs:—so from his steps 
Bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade 
Of the green groves, with all their odorous winds 
And musical motions. Calm, he still pursued 
The stream, that with a larger volume now 
Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there 
Fretted a path through its descending curves 
With its wintry speed. On every side now rose 
Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms, 
Lifted their black and barren pinnacles 
In the light of evening, and its precipice 
Obscuring the ravine, disclosed above, 
Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves, 
Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues 
To the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands 
Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks, 
And seems, with its accumulated crags, 
To overhang the world: for wide expand 
Beneath the wan stars and descending moon 
Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams, 
Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom 
Of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills 
Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge 
Of the remote horizon. The near scene, 
In naked and severe simplicity, 
Made contrast with the universe. A pine, 
Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy 
Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast 
Yielding one only response, at each pause, 
In most familiar cadence, with the howl 
The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams 
Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river, 
Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path, 
Fell into that immeasurable void, 
Scattering its waters to the passing winds. 
 
         Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine 
And torrent, were not all;—one silent nook 
Was there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain, 
Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks, 
It overlooked in its serenity 
The dark earth, and the bending vault of stars. 
It was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile 
Even in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped 
The fissured stones with its entwining arms, 
And did embower with leaves for ever green, 
And berries dark, the smooth and even space 
Of its inviolated floor, and here 
The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore, 
In wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay, 
Red, yellow, or ethereally pale, 
Rivals the pride of summer. 'Tis the haunt 
Of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach 
The wilds to love tranquillity. One step, 
One human step alone, has ever broken 
The stillness of its solitude:—one voice 
Alone inspired its echoes;—even that voice 
Which hither came, floating among the winds, 
And led the loveliest among human forms 
To make their wild haunts the depository 
Of all the grace and beauty that endued 
Its motions, render up its majesty, 
Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm, 
And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould, 
Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss, 
Commit the colours of that varying cheek, 
That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes. 
 
         The dim and hornèd moon hung low, and poured 
A sea of lustre on the horizon's verge 
That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist 
Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank 
Wan moonlight even to fulness: not a star 
Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds, 
Danger's grim playmates, on that precipice 
Slept, clasped in his embrace.—O, storm of death! 
Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night: 
And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still 
Guiding its irresistible career 
In thy devastating omnipotence, 
Art king of this frail world, from the red field 
Of slaughter, from the reeking hospital, 
The patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed 
Of innocence, the scaffold and the throne, 
A mighty voice invokes thee. Ruin calls 
His brother Death. A rare and regal prey 
He hath prepared, prowling around the world; 
Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men 
Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms, 
Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine 
The unheeded tribute of a broken heart. 
 
         When on the threshold of the green recess 
The wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death 
Was on him. Yet a little, ere it fled, 
Did he resign his high and holy soul 
To images of the majestic past, 
That paused within his passive being now, 
Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe 
Through some dim latticed chamber. He did place 
His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk 
Of the old pine. Upon an ivied stone 
Reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest, 
Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink 
Of that obscurest chasm;—and thus he lay, 
Surrendering to their final impulses 
The hovering powers of life. Hope and despair, 
The torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear 
Marred his repose, the influxes of sense, 
And his own being unalloyed by pain, 
Yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed 
The stream of thought, till he lay breathing there 
At peace, and faintly smiling:—his last sight 
Was the great moon, which o'er the western line 
Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended, 
With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed 
To mingle. Now upon the jaggèd hills 
It rests, and still as the divided frame 
Of the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood, 
That ever beat in mystic sympathy 
With nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still: 
And when two lessening points of light alone 
Gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp 
Of his faint respiration scarce did stir 
The stagnate night:—till the minutest ray 
Was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart. 
It paused—it fluttered. But when heaven remained 
Utterly black, the murky shades involved 
An image, silent, cold, and motionless, 
As their own voiceless earth and vacant air. 
Even as a vapour fed with golden beams 
That ministered on sunlight, ere the west 
Eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame— 
No sense, no motion, no divinity— 
A fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings 
The breath of heaven did wander—a bright stream 
Once fed with many-voicèd waves—a dream 
Of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever, 
Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now. 
 
         O, for Medea's wondrous alchemy, 
Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam 
With bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale 
From vernal blooms fresh fragrance! O, that God, 
Profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice 
Which but one living man has drained, who now, 
Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels 
No proud exemption in the blighting curse 
He bears, over the world wanders for ever, 
Lone as incarnate death! O, that the dream 
Of dark magician in his visioned cave, 
Raking the cinders of a crucible 
For life and power, even when his feeble hand 
Shakes in its last decay, were the true law 
Of this so lovely world! But thou art fled 
Like some frail exhalation; which the dawn 
Robes in its golden beams,—ah! thou hast fled! 
The brave, the gentle, and the beautiful, 
The child of grace and genius. Heartless things 
Are done and said i' the world, and many worms 
And beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth 
From sea and mountain, city and wilderness, 
In vesper low or joyous orison, 
Lifts still its solemn voice:—but thou art fled— 
Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes 
Of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee 
Been purest ministers, who are, alas! 
Now thou art not. Upon those pallid lips 
So sweet even in their silence, on those eyes 
That image sleep in death, upon that form 
Yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear 
Be shed—not even in thought. Nor, when those hues 
Are gone, and those divinest lineaments, 
Worn by the senseless wind, shall live alone 
In the frail pauses of this simple strain, 
Let not high verse, mourning the memory 
Of that which is no more, or painting's woe 
Or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery 
Their own cold powers. Art and eloquence, 
And all the shows o' the world are frail and vain 
To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade. 
It is a woe too ""deep for tears,"" when all 
Is reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit, 
Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves 
Those who remain behind, not sobs or groans, 
The passionate tumult of a clinging hope; 
But pale despair and cold tranquillity, 
Nature's vast frame, the web of human things, 
Birth and the grave, that are not as they were.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'The Mind', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45113/alastor-or-the-spirit-of-solitude,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

SCENE.—A Ravine of Icy Rocks in the Indian Caucasus. Prometheus is discovered bound to the Precipice. Panthea and Ione are seated at his feet. Time, night. During the Scene, morning slowly breaks.

Prometheus. 
   Monarch of Gods and Dæmons, and all Spirits 
But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds 
Which Thou and I alone of living things 
Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth 
Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou 
Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise, 
And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts, 
With fear and self-contempt and barren hope. 
Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate, 
Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn, 
O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge. 
Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours, 
And moments aye divided by keen pangs 
Till they seemed years, torture and solitude, 
Scorn and despair,—these are mine empire:— 
More glorious far than that which thou surveyest 
From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God! 
Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame 
Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here 
Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain, 
Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb, 
Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life. 
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever! 
 
   No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure. 
I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt? 
I ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun, 
Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm, 
Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below, 
Have its deaf waves not heard my agony? 
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever! 
 
   The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears 
Of their moon-freezing crystals, the bright chains 
Eat with their burning cold into my bones. 
Heaven's wingèd hound, polluting from thy lips 
His beak in poison not his own, tears up 
My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by, 
The ghastly people of the realm of dream, 
Mocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are charged 
To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds 
When the rocks split and close again behind: 
While from their loud abysses howling throng 
The genii of the storm, urging the rage 
Of whirlwind, and afflict me with keen hail. 
And yet to me welcome is day and night, 
Whether one breaks the hoar frost of the morn, 
Or starry, dim, and slow, the other climbs 
The leaden-coloured east; for then they lead 
The wingless, crawling hours, one among whom 
—As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim— 
Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood 
From these pale feet, which then might trample thee 
If they disdained not such a prostrate slave. 
Disdain! Ah no! I pity thee. What ruin 
Will hunt thee undefended through wide Heaven! 
How will thy soul, cloven to its depth with terror, 
Gape like a hell within! I speak in grief, 
Not exultation, for I hate no more, 
As then ere misery made me wise. The curse 
Once breathed on thee I would recall. Ye Mountains, 
Whose many-voicèd Echoes, through the mist 
Of cataracts, flung the thunder of that spell! 
Ye icy Springs, stagnant with wrinkling frost, 
Which vibrated to hear me, and then crept 
Shuddering through India! Thou serenest Air, 
Through which the Sun walks burning without beams! 
And ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poisèd wings 
Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss, 
As thunder, louder than your own, made rock 
The orbèd world! If then my words had power, 
Though I am changed so that aught evil wish 
Is dead within; although no memory be 
Of what is hate, let them not lose it now! 
What was that curse? for ye all heard me speak.",blank verse,meters,"['Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45136/prometheus-unbound,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Percy Bysshe Shelley,1792–1822,The Cloud,"I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
     From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
     In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
     The sweet buds every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
     As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
     And whiten the green plains under,
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
     And laugh as I pass in thunder.

 I sift the snow on the mountains below,
     And their great pines groan aghast;
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
     While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,
     Lightning my pilot sits;
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,
     It struggles and howls at fits;
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
     This pilot is guiding me,
Lured by the love of the genii that move
     In the depths of the purple sea;
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,
     Over the lakes and the plains,
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,
     The Spirit he loves remains;
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,
     Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

 The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,
     And his burning plumes outspread,
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,
     When the morning star shines dead;
As on the jag of a mountain crag,
     Which an earthquake rocks and swings,
An eagle alit one moment may sit
     In the light of its golden wings.
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,
     Its ardours of rest and of love,
And the crimson pall of eve may fall
     From the depth of Heaven above,
With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest,
     As still as a brooding dove.

 That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
     Whom mortals call the Moon,
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,
     By the midnight breezes strewn;
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,
     Which only the angels hear,
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,
     The stars peep behind her and peer;
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,
     Like a swarm of golden bees,
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,
     Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,
     Are each paved with the moon and these.

 I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,
     And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,
     When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,
     Over a torrent sea,
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,
     The mountains its columns be.
The triumphal arch through which I march
     With hurricane, fire, and snow,
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,
     Is the million-coloured bow;
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,
     While the moist Earth was laughing below.

 I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
     And the nursling of the Sky;
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
     I change, but I cannot die.
For after the rain when with never a stain
     The pavilion of Heaven is bare,
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
     Build up the blue dome of air,
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
     And out of the caverns of rain,
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
     I arise and unbuild it again.",common measure,meters,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Weather', 'Pastoral', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45117/the-cloud-56d2247bf4112,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/percy-bysshe-shelley,,1792.0,1822.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

John Clare,1793 – 1864,Sheep in Winter,"The sheep get up and make their many tracks 
And bear a load of snow upon their backs, 
And gnaw the frozen turnip to the ground 
With sharp quick bite, and then go noising round 
The boy that pecks the turnips all the day 
And knocks his hands to keep the cold away 
And laps his legs in straw to keep them warm 
And hides behind the hedges from the storm. 
The sheep, as tame as dogs, go where he goes 
And try to shake their fleeces from the snows, 
Then leave their frozen meal and wander round 
The stubble stack that stands beside the ground, 
And lie all night and face the drizzling storm 
And shun the hovel where they might be warm.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Animals', 'Audio', 'Nature', 'Pastoral', 'Public Domain', 'Storms', 'Winter']","This poem is in the public domain. Published in Poem-a-Day on December 17, 2023, by the Academy of American Poets.

Felicia Dorothea Hemans,1793–1835,To Wordsworth,"Thine is a strain to read among the hills,
The old and full of voices — by the source
Of some free stream, whose gladdening presence fills
The solitude with sound; for in its course
Even such is thy deep song, that seems a part
Of those high scenes, a fountain from the heart.

Or its calm spirit fitly may be taken
To the still breast in sunny garden bowers,
Where vernal winds each tree’s low tones awaken,
And bud and bell with changes mark the hours.
There let thy thoughts be with me, while the day
Sinks with a golden and serene decay.

Or by some hearth where happy faces meet,
When night hath hushed the woods, with all their birds,
There, from some gentle voice, that lay were sweet
As antique music, linked with household words;
While in pleased murmurs woman’s lip might move,
And the raised eye of childhood shine in love.

Or where the shadows of dark solemn yews
Brood silently o’er some lone burial-ground,
Thy verse hath power that brightly might diffuse
A breath, a kindling, as of spring, around;
From its own glow of hope and courage high,
And steadfast faith’s victorious constancy.

True bard and holy! — thou art e’en as one
Who, by some secret gift of soul or eye,
In every spot beneath the smiling sun,
Sees where the springs of living waters lie;
Unseen awhile they sleep — till, touched by thee,
Bright healthful waves flow forth, to each glad wanderer free.",ode,types/modes,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Ode']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51935/to-wordsworth,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/felicia-dorothea-hemans,,1793.0,1835.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

The spring is come, and birds are building nests;
The old cock-robin to the sty is come,
With olive feathers and its ruddy breast;
And the old cock, with wattles and red comb,
Struts with the hens, and seems to like some best,
Then crows, and looks about for little crumbs,
Swept out by little folks an hour ago;
The pigs sleep in the sty; the bookman comes—
The little boy lets home-close nesting go,
And pockets tops and taws, where daisies blow,
To look at the new number just laid down,
With lots of pictures, and good stories too,
And Jack the Giant-killer's high renown.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Learning Resource', 'Relationships', 'Pets', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Spring', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Sonnet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43953/to-john-clare,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-clare,,1793.0,1864.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Clare,1793–1864,The Skylark,"The rolls and harrows lie at rest beside
The battered road; and spreading far and wide
Above the russet clods, the corn is seen
Sprouting its spiry points of tender green,
Where squats the hare, to terrors wide awake,
Like some brown clod the harrows failed to break.
Opening their golden caskets to the sun,
The buttercups make schoolboys eager run,
To see who shall be first to pluck the prize—
Up from their hurry, see, the skylark flies,
And o'er her half-formed nest, with happy wings
Winnows the air, till in the cloud she sings,
Then hangs a dust-spot in the sunny skies,
And drops, and drops, till in her nest she lies,
Which they unheeded passed—not dreaming then
That birds which flew so high would drop agen
To nests upon the ground, which anything
May come at to destroy. Had they the wing
Like such a bird, themselves would be too proud,
And build on nothing but a passing cloud!
As free from danger as the heavens are free
From pain and toil, there would they build and be,
And sail about the world to scenes unheard
Of and unseen—Oh, were they but a bird!
So think they, while they listen to its song,
And smile and fancy and so pass along;
While its low nest, moist with the dews of morn,
Lies safely, with the leveret, in the corn.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Animals', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43950/the-skylark,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-clare,,1793.0,1864.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

I kissed and bade my love good-bye.

I met her in the greenest dells,
Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells;
The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye,
The bee kissed and went singing by,
A sunbeam found a passage there,
A gold chain round her neck so fair;
As secret as the wild bee's song
She lay there all the summer long.

Till e'en the breeze would knock me down;

         As childhood's sweet delight. 
 
And then he shut his little eyes, 
         And flowers would notice not; 
Birds' nests and eggs caused no surprise, 
         He now no blossoms got; 
         They met with plaintive sighs.

         By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,
And pardon that thy secrets should be sung
         Even into thine own soft-conched ear:
Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see
         The winged Psyche with awaken’d eyes?
I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly,
         And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,
Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side
         In deepest grass, beneath the whisp’ring roof
         Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran
                A brooklet, scarce espied:

Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,
         Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian,
They lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass;
         Their arms embraced, and their pinions too;
         Their lips touch’d not, but had not bade adieu,
As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber,
And ready still past kisses to outnumber
         At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love:
                The winged boy I knew;
But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove?
                His Psyche true!

O latest born and loveliest vision far
         Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy!
Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-region’d star,
         Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;
Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,
                Nor altar heap’d with flowers;
Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan
                Upon the midnight hours;
No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet
         From chain-swung censer teeming;
No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat
         Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.

O brightest! though too late for antique vows,
         Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,
When holy were the haunted forest boughs,
         Holy the air, the water, and the fire;
Yet even in these days so far retir'd
         From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,
         Fluttering among the faint Olympians,
I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir’d.
So let me be thy choir, and make a moan
                Upon the midnight hours;
Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet
         From swinged censer teeming;
Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat
         Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.

Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane
         In some untrodden region of my mind,
Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,
         Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind:
Far, far around shall those dark-cluster’d trees
         Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep;
And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,
         The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull’d to sleep;
And in the midst of this wide quietness
A rosy sanctuary will I dress
With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain,
         With buds, and bells, and stars without a name,
With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,
         Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same:
And there shall be for thee all soft delight
         That shadowy thought can win,
A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,
         To let the warm Love in!",ode,types/modes,"['Ode', 'Thought', ""Valentine's Day""]",This poem is in the public domain. ,https://poets.org/poem/ode-psyche,https://poets.org/poet/john-keats,2016,1795.0,1821.0,['Ode'],['Thought'],"[""Valentine's Day""]",Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets

Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
               Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
       For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
               And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.

2.

But when the melancholy fit shall fall
       Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
       And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
       Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
               Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
       Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
               And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.

3.

She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
       And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
       Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
              Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
       His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
              And be among her cloudy trophies hung.",ode,types/modes,"['Ode', 'Beauty', 'Desire', 'Existential']","This poem is in the public domain, and was published in Keats: Poems Published in 1820 (The Clarendon Press, 1909).

John Keats,1795 – 1821,Ode on a Grecian Urn,"Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness, 
    Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express 
    A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fring’d legend haunts about thy shape 
    Of deities or mortals, or of both,
        In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
What men or gods are these? What maidens loth? 
    What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
        What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
 
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard 
    Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d, 
    Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave 
    Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
        Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss, 
Though winning near the goal—yet, do not grieve;
    She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, 
        For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed 
    Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
    For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love! 
    For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,
        For ever panting, and for ever young; 
All breathing human passion far above,
    That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d, 
        A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

Who are these coming to the sacrifice? 
    To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, 
    And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore, 
    Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
        Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn? 
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
    Will silent be; and not a soul to tell 
        Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.

O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede 
    Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed; 
    Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity: Cold pastoral!
    When old age shall this generation waste, 
        Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say’st,
    “Beauty is truth, truth beauty”—that is all 
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.",ekphrasis,types/modes,"['Ekphrastic', 'Public Domain', 'Visual Art']","This poem is in the public domain.

Let it not be among the jumbled heap
Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep,—
Nature’s observatory—whence the dell,
Its flowery slopes, its river’s crystal swell,
May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep
’Mongst boughs pavillion’d, where the deer’s swift leap
Startles the wild bee from the fox-glove bell.
But though I’ll gladly trace these scenes with thee,
Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,
Whose words are images of thoughts refin’d,
Is my soul’s pleasure; and it sure must be
Almost the highest bliss of human-kind,
When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Loneliness', 'Public Domain', 'Self', 'Thought', 'Weddings']","This poem is in the public domain.

The sedge has withered from the lake,

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
       So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel’s granary is full,
       And the harvest’s done.

I see a lily on thy brow,
       With anguish moist and fever-dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
       Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
       Full beautiful—a faery’s child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
       And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
       And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
       And made sweet moan

I set her on my pacing steed,
       And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
       A faery’s song.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
       And honey wild, and manna-dew,
And sure in language strange she said—
       ‘I love thee true’.

She took me to her Elfin grot,
       And there she wept and sighed full sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
       With kisses four.

And there she lullèd me asleep,
       And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever dreamt
       On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
       Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
       Thee hath in thrall!’

I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
       With horrid warning gapèd wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
       On the cold hill’s side.

And this is why I sojourn here,
       Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
       And no birds sing.

John Keats,1795–1821,from Endymion,"A Poetic Romance 
 
(excerpt)

BOOK I 
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: 
Its loveliness increases; it will never 
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. 
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing 
A flowery band to bind us to the earth, 
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth 
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, 
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways 
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, 
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall 
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, 
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon 
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils 
With the green world they live in; and clear rills 
That for themselves a cooling covert make 
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake, 
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: 
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms 
We have imagined for the mighty dead; 
All lovely tales that we have heard or read: 
An endless fountain of immortal drink, 
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. 
 
       Nor do we merely feel these essences 
For one short hour; no, even as the trees 
That whisper round a temple become soon 
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, 
The passion poesy, glories infinite, 
Haunt us till they become a cheering light 
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast, 
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast; 
They always must be with us, or we die. 
 
       Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I 
Will trace the story of Endymion. 
The very music of the name has gone 
Into my being, and each pleasant scene 
Is growing fresh before me as the green 
Of our own valleys: so I will begin 
Now while I cannot hear the city's din; 
Now while the early budders are just new, 
And run in mazes of the youngest hue 
About old forests; while the willow trails 
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails 
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year 
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer 
My little boat, for many quiet hours, 
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers. 
Many and many a verse I hope to write, 
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white, 
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees 
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, 
I must be near the middle of my story. 
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary, 
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold, 
With universal tinge of sober gold, 
Be all about me when I make an end. 
And now, at once adventuresome, I send 
My herald thought into a wilderness: 
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress 
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed 
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Love', 'Classic Love', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet', 'Imagery', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44469/endymion-56d2239287ca5,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats,,1795.0,1821.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Through the thought still spread beyond her:
Open wide the mind's cage-door,
She'll dart forth, and cloudward soar.
O sweet Fancy! let her loose;
Summer's joys are spoilt by use,
And the enjoying of the Spring
Fades as does its blossoming;
Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too,
Blushing through the mist and dew,
Cloys with tasting: What do then?
Sit thee by the ingle, when
The sear faggot blazes bright,
Spirit of a winter's night;
When the soundless earth is muffled,
And the caked snow is shuffled
From the ploughboy's heavy shoon;
When the Night doth meet the Noon
In a dark conspiracy
To banish Even from her sky.
Sit thee there, and send abroad,
With a mind self-overaw'd,
Fancy, high-commission'd:—send her!
She has vassals to attend her:
She will bring, in spite of frost,
Beauties that the earth hath lost;
She will bring thee, all together,
All delights of summer weather;
All the buds and bells of May,
From dewy sward or thorny spray;
All the heaped Autumn's wealth,
With a still, mysterious stealth:
She will mix these pleasures up
Like three fit wines in a cup,
And thou shalt quaff it:—thou shalt hear
Distant harvest-carols clear;
Rustle of the reaped corn;
Sweet birds antheming the morn:
And, in the same moment, hark!
'Tis the early April lark,
Or the rooks, with busy caw,
Foraging for sticks and straw.
Thou shalt, at one glance, behold
The daisy and the marigold;
White-plum'd lillies, and the first
Hedge-grown primrose that hath burst;
Shaded hyacinth, alway
Sapphire queen of the mid-May;
And every leaf, and every flower
Pearled with the self-same shower.
Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
Meagre from its celled sleep;
And the snake all winter-thin
Cast on sunny bank its skin;
Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see
Hatching in the hawthorn-tree,
When the hen-bird's wing doth rest
Quiet on her mossy nest;
Then the hurry and alarm
When the bee-hive casts its swarm;
Acorns ripe down-pattering,
While the autumn breezes sing.

    Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose;
Every thing is spoilt by use:
Where's the cheek that doth not fade,
Too much gaz'd at? Where's the maid
Whose lip mature is ever new?
Where's the eye, however blue,
Doth not weary? Where's the face
One would meet in every place?
Where's the voice, however soft,
One would hear so very oft?
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth.
Let, then, winged Fancy find
Thee a mistress to thy mind:
Dulcet-ey'd as Ceres' daughter,
Ere the God of Torment taught her
How to frown and how to chide;
With a waist and with a side
White as Hebe's, when her zone
Slipt its golden clasp, and down
Fell her kirtle to her feet,
While she held the goblet sweet
And Jove grew languid.—Break the mesh
Of the Fancy's silken leash;
Quickly break her prison-string
And such joys as these she'll bring.—

What Elysium have ye known,
Happy field or mossy cavern,
Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?
Have ye tippled drink more fine
Than mine host's Canary wine?
Or are fruits of Paradise
Sweeter than those dainty pies
Of venison? O generous food!

Would, with his maid Marian,
Sup and bowse from horn and can.

Mine host's sign-board flew away,
Nobody knew whither, till
An astrologer's old quill
To a sheepskin gave the story,
Said he saw you in your glory,
Underneath a new old sign
Sipping beverage divine,
And pledging with contented smack
The Mermaid in the Zodiac.

John Keats,1795–1821,Robin Hood,"TO A FRIEND

No! those days are gone away 
And their hours are old and gray, 
And their minutes buried all 
Under the down-trodden pall 
Of the leaves of many years: 
Many times have winter's shears, 
Frozen North, and chilling East, 
Sounded tempests to the feast 
Of the forest's whispering fleeces, 
Since men knew nor rent nor leases. 
 
         No, the bugle sounds no more, 
And the twanging bow no more; 
Silent is the ivory shrill 
Past the heath and up the hill; 
There is no mid-forest laugh, 
Where lone Echo gives the half 
To some wight, amaz'd to hear 
Jesting, deep in forest drear. 
 
         On the fairest time of June 
You may go, with sun or moon, 
Or the seven stars to light you, 
Or the polar ray to right you; 
But you never may behold 
Little John, or Robin bold; 
Never one, of all the clan, 
Thrumming on an empty can 
Some old hunting ditty, while 
He doth his green way beguile 
To fair hostess Merriment, 
Down beside the pasture Trent; 
For he left the merry tale 
Messenger for spicy ale. 
 
         Gone, the merry morris din; 
Gone, the song of Gamelyn; 
Gone, the tough-belted outlaw 
Idling in the ""grenè shawe""; 
All are gone away and past! 
And if Robin should be cast 
Sudden from his turfed grave, 
And if Marian should have 
Once again her forest days, 
She would weep, and he would craze: 
He would swear, for all his oaks, 
Fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes, 
Have rotted on the briny seas; 
She would weep that her wild bees 
Sang not to her—strange! that honey 
Can't be got without hard money! 
 
         So it is: yet let us sing, 
Honour to the old bow-string! 
Honour to the bugle-horn! 
Honour to the woods unshorn! 
Honour to the Lincoln green! 
Honour to the archer keen! 
Honour to tight little John, 
And the horse he rode upon! 
Honour to bold Robin Hood, 
Sleeping in the underwood! 
Honour to maid Marian, 
And to all the Sherwood-clan!

John Keats,1795–1821,Ode on a Grecian Urn,"Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
       Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
       A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
       Of deities or mortals, or of both,
               In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
       What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
               What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
       Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
       Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
       Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
               Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
       She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
               For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
         Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
         For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
         For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
                For ever panting, and for ever young;
All breathing human passion far above,
         That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
                A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
         To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
         And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore,
         Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
                Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
         Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
                Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
         Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
         Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
         When old age shall this generation waste,
                Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe

John Keats,1795–1821,Ode to a Nightingale,"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains 
         My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, 
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains 
         One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, 
         But being too happy in thine happiness,— 
                That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees 
                        In some melodious plot 
         Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, 
                Singest of summer in full-throated ease. 
 
O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been 
         Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, 
Tasting of Flora and the country green, 
         Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth! 
O for a beaker full of the warm South, 
         Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, 
                With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, 
                        And purple-stained mouth; 
         That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, 
                And with thee fade away into the forest dim: 
 
Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget 
         What thou among the leaves hast never known, 
The weariness, the fever, and the fret 
         Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; 
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, 
         Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; 
                Where but to think is to be full of sorrow 
                        And leaden-eyed despairs, 
         Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, 
                Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. 
 
Away! away! for I will fly to thee, 
         Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, 
But on the viewless wings of Poesy, 
         Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: 
Already with thee! tender is the night, 
         And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, 
                Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays; 
                        But here there is no light, 
         Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown 
                Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. 
 
I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, 
         Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, 
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet 
         Wherewith the seasonable month endows 
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; 
         White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; 
                Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves; 
                        And mid-May's eldest child, 
         The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, 
                The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. 
 
Darkling I listen; and, for many a time 
         I have been half in love with easeful Death, 
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, 
         To take into the air my quiet breath; 
                Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 
         To cease upon the midnight with no pain, 
                While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad 
                        In such an ecstasy! 
         Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain— 
                   To thy high requiem become a sod. 
 
Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! 
         No hungry generations tread thee down; 
The voice I hear this passing night was heard 
         In ancient days by emperor and clown: 
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path 
         Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, 
                She stood in tears amid the alien corn; 
                        The same that oft-times hath 
         Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam 
                Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. 
 
Forlorn! the very word is like a bell 
         To toll me back from thee to my sole self! 
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well 
         As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf. 
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades 
         Past the near meadows, over the still stream, 
                Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep 
                        In the next valley-glades: 
         Was it a vision, or a waking dream? 
                Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?",ode,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Activities', 'Eating & Drinking', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Music', 'Ode', 'Allusion', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44479/ode-to-a-nightingale,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats,,1795.0,1821.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

   Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
   With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
   And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
      To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
   With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
      For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
   Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
   Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
   Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
      Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
   Steady thy laden head across a brook;
   Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
      Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?
   Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
   And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
   Among the river sallows, borne aloft
      Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;

   The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;

(excerpt)

BOOK I 
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: 
Its loveliness increases; it will never 
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. 
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing 
A flowery band to bind us to the earth, 
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth 
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, 
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways 
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, 
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall 
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, 
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon 
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils 
With the green world they live in; and clear rills 
That for themselves a cooling covert make 
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake, 
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: 
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms 
We have imagined for the mighty dead; 
All lovely tales that we have heard or read: 
An endless fountain of immortal drink, 
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. 
 
       Nor do we merely feel these essences 
For one short hour; no, even as the trees 
That whisper round a temple become soon 
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, 
The passion poesy, glories infinite, 
Haunt us till they become a cheering light 
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast, 
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast; 
They always must be with us, or we die. 
 
       Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I 
Will trace the story of Endymion. 
The very music of the name has gone 
Into my being, and each pleasant scene 
Is growing fresh before me as the green 
Of our own valleys: so I will begin 
Now while I cannot hear the city's din; 
Now while the early budders are just new, 
And run in mazes of the youngest hue 
About old forests; while the willow trails 
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails 
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year 
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer 
My little boat, for many quiet hours, 
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers. 
Many and many a verse I hope to write, 
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white, 
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees 
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, 
I must be near the middle of my story. 
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary, 
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold, 
With universal tinge of sober gold, 
Be all about me when I make an end. 
And now, at once adventuresome, I send 
My herald thought into a wilderness: 
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress 
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed 
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Love', 'Classic Love', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Pastoral', 'Couplet', 'Imagery', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44469/endymion-56d2239287ca5,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats,,1795.0,1821.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

And pardon that thy secrets should be sung 
         Even into thine own soft-conched ear: 
Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see 
         The winged Psyche with awaken'd eyes? 
I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly, 
         And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise, 
Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side 
         In deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof 
         Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran 
                A brooklet, scarce espied: 
 
Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed, 
         Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian, 
They lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass; 
         Their arms embraced, and their pinions too; 
         Their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu, 
As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, 
And ready still past kisses to outnumber 
         At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love: 
                The winged boy I knew; 
But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove? 
                His Psyche true! 
 
O latest born and loveliest vision far 
         Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy! 
Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-region'd star, 
         Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky; 
Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,

Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan 
                Upon the midnight hours; 
No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet 
         From chain-swung censer teeming; 
No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat 
         Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming. 
 
O brightest! though too late for antique vows, 
         Too, too late for the fond believing lyre, 
When holy were the haunted forest boughs, 
         Holy the air, the water, and the fire;

         From happy pieties, thy lucent fans, 
         Fluttering among the faint Olympians, 
I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir'd. 
So let me be thy choir, and make a moan 
                Upon the midnight hours; 
Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet 
         From swinged censer teeming; 
Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat 
         Of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming. 
 
Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane 
         In some untrodden region of my mind, 
Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain, 
         Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind: 
Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees 
         Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep; 
And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees, 
         The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep; 
And in the midst of this wide quietness 
A rosy sanctuary will I dress 
   With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain, 
         With buds, and bells, and stars without a name, 
With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign, 
         Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: 
And there shall be for thee all soft delight 
         That shadowy thought can win, 
A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,

John Keats,1795–1821,Hyperion,"(excerpt)

BOOK I 
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale 
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, 
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star, 
Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone, 
Still as the silence round about his lair; 
Forest on forest hung about his head 
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there, 
Not so much life as on a summer's day 
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass, 
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. 
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more 
By reason of his fallen divinity 
Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds 
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips. 
 
       Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went, 
No further than to where his feet had stray'd, 
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground 
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, 
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed; 
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth, 
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet. 
 
       It seem'd no force could wake him from his place; 
But there came one, who with a kindred hand 
Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low 
With reverence, though to one who knew it not. 
She was a Goddess of the infant world; 
By her in stature the tall Amazon 
Had stood a pigmy's height; she would have ta'en 
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck; 
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel. 
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx, 
Pedestal'd haply in a palace court, 
When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore. 
But oh! how unlike marble was that face: 
How beautiful, if sorrow had not made 
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self. 
There was a listening fear in her regard, 
As if calamity had but begun; 
As if the vanward clouds of evil days 
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear 
Was with its stored thunder labouring up. 
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot 
Where beats the human heart, as if just there, 
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain: 
The other upon Saturn's bended neck 
She laid, and to the level of his ear 
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake 
In solemn tenour and deep organ tone: 
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue 
Would come in these like accents; O how frail 
To that large utterance of the early Gods! 
""Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King? 
I have no comfort for thee, no not one: 
I cannot say, ""O wherefore sleepest thou?"" 
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth 
Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God; 
And ocean too, with all its solemn noise, 
Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air 
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty. 
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command, 
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; 
And thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd hands 
Scorches and burns our once serene domain. 
O aching time! O moments big as years! 
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth, 
And press it so upon our weary griefs 
That unbelief has not a space to breathe. 
Saturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I 
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude? 
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes? 
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."" 
 
       As when, upon a tranced summer-night, 
Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods, 
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, 
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, 
Save from one gradual solitary gust 
Which comes upon the silence, and dies off, 
As if the ebbing air had but one wave; 
So came these words and went; the while in tears 
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground, 
Just where her falling hair might be outspread 
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet. 
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed 
Her silver seasons four upon the night, 
And still these two were postured motionless, 
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; 
The frozen God still couchant on the earth, 
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet: 
Until at length old Saturn lifted up 
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, 
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, 
And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake, 
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard 
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady: 
""O tender spouse of gold Hyperion, 
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face; 
Look up, and let me see our doom in it; 
Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape 
Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice 
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow, 
Naked and bare of its great diadem, 
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power 
To make me desolate? whence came the strength? 
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth, 
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp? 
But it is so, and I am smother'd up, 
And buried from all godlike exercise 
Of influence benign on planets pale, 
Of admonitions to the winds and seas, 
Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting, 
And all those acts which Deity supreme 
Doth ease its heart of love in.—I am gone 
Away from my own bosom: I have left 
My strong identity, my real self, 
Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit 
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search! 
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round 
Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light; 
Space region'd with life-air; and barren void; 
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.— 
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest 
A certain shape or shadow, making way 
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess 
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must 
Be of ripe progress—Saturn must be King. 
Yes, there must be a golden victory; 
There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown 
Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival 
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan, 
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir 
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be 
Beautiful things made new, for the surprise 
Of the sky-children; I will give command: 
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"" 
 
       This passion lifted him upon his feet, 
And made his hands to struggle in the air, 
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat, 
His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease. 
He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep; 
A little time, and then again he snatch'd 
Utterance thus.—""But cannot I create? 
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth 
Another world, another universe, 
To overbear and crumble this to nought? 
Where is another chaos? Where?""—That word 
Found way unto Olympus, and made quake 
The rebel three.—Thea was startled up, 
And in her bearing was a sort of hope, 
As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe. 
""This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends, 
O Saturn! come away, and give them heart; 
I know the covert, from thence came I hither."" 
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went 
With backward footing through the shade a space: 
He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way 
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist 
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest. 
 
       Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed, 
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe, 
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe: 
The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound, 
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more, 
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice. 
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept 
His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;— 
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire 
Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up 
From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure: 
For as among us mortals omens drear 
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he— 
Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech, 
Or the familiar visiting of one 
Upon the first toll of his passing bell, 
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp; 
But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve, 
Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright 
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold, 
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, 
Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts, 
Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries; 
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds 
Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings, 
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men, 
Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard, 
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men. 
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths 
Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills, 
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took 
Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick: 
And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, 
After the full completion of fair day,— 
For rest divine upon exalted couch 
And slumber in the arms of melody, 
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease 
With stride colossal, on from hall to hall; 
While far within each aisle and deep recess, 
His winged minions in close clusters stood, 
Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men 
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops, 
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. 
Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance, 
Went step for step with Thea through the woods, 
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, 
Came slope upon the threshold of the west; 
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope 
In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes, 
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet 
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies; 
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape, 
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye, 
That inlet to severe magnificence 
Stood full blown, for the God to enter in. 
 
       He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath; 
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels, 
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, 
That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours 
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared, 
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, 
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light, 
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades, 
Until he reach'd the great main cupola; 
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot, 
And from the basements deep to the high towers 
Jarr'd his own golden region; and before 
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd, 
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb, 
To this result: ""O dreams of day and night! 
O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain! 
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom! 
O lank-ear'd Phantoms of black-weeded pools! 
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why 
Is my eternal essence thus distraught 
To see and to behold these horrors new? 
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall? 
Am I to leave this haven of my rest, 
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime, 
This calm luxuriance of blissful light, 
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes, 
Of all my lucent empire? It is left 
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine. 
The blaze, the splendour, and the symmetry, 
I cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness. 
Even here, into my centre of repose, 
The shady visions come to domineer, 
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.— 
Fall!—No, by Tellus and her briny robes! 
Over the fiery frontier of my realms 
I will advance a terrible right arm 
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove, 
And bid old Saturn take his throne again.""— 
He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat 
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth; 
For as in the theatres of crowded men 
Hubbub increases more they call out ""Hush!"" 
So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale 
Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold; 
And from the mirror'd level where he stood 
A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh. 
At this, through all his bulk an agony 
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, 
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular 
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd 
From over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled 
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours 
Before the dawn in season due should blush, 
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals, 
Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide 
Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams. 
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode 
Each day from east to west the heavens through, 
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds; 
Nor therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid, 
But ever and anon the glancing spheres, 
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure, 
Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark 
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep 
Up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old 
Which sages and keen-ey'd astrologers 
Then living on the earth, with labouring thought 
Won from the gaze of many centuries: 
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge 
Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone, 
Their wisdom long since fled.—Two wings this orb 
Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings, 
Ever exalted at the God's approach: 
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense 
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were; 
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse, 
Awaiting for Hyperion's command. 
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne 
And bid the day begin, if but for change. 
He might not:—No, though a primeval God: 
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd. 
Therefore the operations of the dawn 
Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told. 
Those silver wings expanded sisterly, 
Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide 
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night; 
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes, 
Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent 
His spirit to the sorrow of the time; 
And all along a dismal rack of clouds, 
Upon the boundaries of day and night, 
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint. 
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars 
Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice 
Of Coelus, from the universal space, 
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear. 
""O brightest of my children dear, earth-born 
And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries 
All unrevealed even to the powers 
Which met at thy creating; at whose joys 
And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft, 
I, C{oe}lus, wonder, how they came and whence; 
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be, 
Distinct, and visible; symbols divine, 
Manifestations of that beauteous life 
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space: 
Of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child! 
Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses! 
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion 
Of son against his sire. I saw him fall, 
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne! 
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice 
Found way from forth the thunders round his head! 
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face 
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is: 
For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods. 
Divine ye were created, and divine 
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, 
Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled: 
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath; 
Actions of rage and passion; even as 
I see them, on the mortal world beneath, 
In men who die.—This is the grief, O Son! 
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall! 
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable, 
As thou canst move about, an evident God; 
And canst oppose to each malignant hour 
Ethereal presence:—I am but a voice; 
My life is but the life of winds and tides, 
No more than winds and tides can I avail:— 
But thou canst.—Be thou therefore in the van 
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb 
Before the tense string murmur.—To the earth! 
For there thou wilt find Saturn and his woes. 
Meanwhile I will keep watch on thy bright sun, 
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.""— 
Ere half this region-whisper had come down, 
Hyperion arose, and on the stars 
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide 
Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide: 
And still they were the same bright, patient stars. 
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast, 
Like to a diver in the pearly seas, 
Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore, 
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Nature', 'Stars, Planets, Heavens', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Blank Verse', 'Alliteration', 'Allusion', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44473/hyperion,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats,,1795.0,1821.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Unconscious floating on the fickle sea,
Herself her all, she lives in privacy;
Her waking life as lonely as a trance,
Doom’d to behold the universal dance,

The solemn step, coy slide, the merry bounds.

Away! Three thousand feet at gravel work,
 Mocking a Vauxhall shower!—Married and Single
Crush—rush;—Soak’d Silks with wet white Satin mingle.
 Hengler! Madame! round whom all bright sparks lurk
Calls audibly on Mr. and Mrs. Pringle
 To study the Sublime, &c.—(vide Burke)
All Noses are upturn’d!—Whish-ish!—On high
 The rocket rushes—trails—just steals in sight—
Then droops and melts in bubbles of blue light—
 And Darkness reigns—Then balls flare up and die—
Wheels whiz—smack crackers—serpents twist—and then
 Back to the cold transparent ham again!",sonnet,verse forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Sonnet']","Source:

Letitia Elizabeth Landon,1802–1838,Change,"And this is what is left of youth! . . .
There were two boys, who were bred up together,
Shared the same bed, and fed at the same board;
Each tried the other’s sport, from their first chase,
Young hunters of the butterfly and bee,
To when they followed the fleet hare, and tried
The swiftness of the bird. They lay beside
The silver trout stream, watching as the sun
Played on the bubbles: shared each in the store
Of either’s garden: and together read
Of him, the master of the desert isle,
Till a low hut, a gun, and a canoe,
Bounded their wishes. Or if ever came
A thought of future days, ’twas but to say
That they would share each other’s lot, and do
Wonders, no doubt. But this was vain: they parted
With promises of long remembrance, words
Whose kindness was the heart’s, and those warm tears,
Hidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them,
But which are thought upon in after-years
As what we would give worlds to shed once more.

 They met again, — but different from themselves,
At least what each remembered of themselves:
The one proud as a soldier of his rank,
And of his many battles: and the other
Proud of his Indian wealth, and of the skill
And toil which gathered it; each with a brow
And heart alike darkened by years and care.
They met with cold words, and yet colder looks:
Each was changed in himself, and yet each thought
The other only changed, himself the same.
And coldness bred dislike, and rivalry
Came like the pestilence o’er some sweet thoughts
That lingered yet, healthy and beautiful,
Amid dark and unkindly ones. And they,
Whose boyhood had not known one jarring word,
Were strangers in their age: if their eyes met,
’Twas but to look contempt, and when they spoke,
Their speech was wormwood! . . .

It had no refuge from thy love,—no Heaven
But in thy fatal presence;—from afar

O’erfraught with light and splendor. Could I deem
How dark a shadow should obscure its beam?—
Could I believe that pain could ever dwell
Where thy bright presence cast its blissful spell?
Thou wert my proud palladium;—could I fear
The avenging Destinies when thou wert near?—

Ralph Waldo Emerson,1803–1882,Fate,"That you are fair or wise is vain,
Or strong, or rich, or generous;
You must have also the untaught strain
That sheds beauty on the rose.
There is a melody born of melody,
Which melts the world into a sea:
Toil could never compass it;
Art its height could never hit;
It came never out of wit;
But a music music-born
Well may Jove and Juno scorn.
Thy beauty, if it lack the fire
Which drives me mad with sweet desire,
What boots it? what the soldier's mail,
Unless he conquer and prevail?
What all the goods thy pride which lift,
If thou pine for another's gift?
Alas! that one is born in blight,
Victim of perpetual slight:
When thou lookest on his face,
Thy heart saith, ""Brother, go thy ways!
None shall ask thee what thou doest,
Or care a rush for what thou knowest,
Or listen when thou repliest,
Or remember where thou liest,
Or how thy supper is sodden;""
And another is born
To make the sun forgotten.
Surely he carries a talisman
Under his tongue;
Broad are his shoulders, and strong;
And his eye is scornful,
Threatening, and young.
I hold it of little matter
Whether your jewel be of pure water,
A rose diamond or a white,
But whether it dazzle me with light.
I care not how you are dressed,
In the coarsest or in the best;
Nor whether your name is base or brave;
Nor for the fashion of your behavior;
But whether you charm me,
Bid my bread feed and my fire warm me,
And dress up Nature in your favor.
One thing is forever good;
That one thing is Success, —
Dear to the Eumenides,
And to all the heavenly brood.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,1803–1882,Good-Bye,"Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home:
Thou art not my friend, and I'm not thine.
Long through thy weary crowds I roam;
A river-ark on the ocean brine,
Long I've been tossed like the driven foam;
But now, proud world! I'm going home.

Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face;
To Grandeur with his wise grimace;
To upstart Wealth's averted eye;
To supple Office, low and high;
To crowded halls, to court and street;
To frozen hearts and hasting feet;
To those who go, and those who come;
Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home.

I am going to my own hearth-stone,
Bosomed in yon green hills alone, —
A secret nook in a pleasant land,
Whose groves the frolic fairies planned;
Where arches green, the livelong day,
Echo the blackbird's roundelay,
And vulgar feet have never trod
A spot that is sacred to thought and God.

O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,
I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome;
And when I am stretched beneath the pines,
Where the evening star so holy shines,
I laugh at the lore and the pride of man,
At the sophist schools, and the learned clan;

Of thee from the hill-top looking down;

Far-heard, lows not thine ear to charm;

Deems not that great Napoleon
Stops his horse, and lists with delight,
Whilst his files sweep round yon Alpine height;

The bubbles of the latest wave
Fresh pearls to their enamel gave;
And the bellowing of the savage sea
Greeted their safe escape to me.
I wiped away the weeds and foam,
I fetched my sea-born treasures home;
But the poor, unsightly, noisome things
Had left their beauty on the shore,
With the sun, and the sand, and the wild uproar.

As 'mid the virgin train she stayed,
Nor knew her beauty's best attire
Was woven still by the snow-white choir.

The gay enchantment was undone,
A gentle wife, but fairy none.

Beauty is unripe childhood's cheat;

Running over the club-moss burrs;

Pine-cones and acorns lay on the ground;
Over me soared the eternal sky,
Full of light and of deity;

The rolling river, the morning bird; —

Ralph Waldo Emerson,1803–1882,"Ode, Inscribed to William H. Channing","Though loath to grieve 
The evil time's sole patriot, 
I cannot leave 
My honied thought 
For the priest's cant, 
Or statesman's rant. 
 
If I refuse 
My study for their politique, 
Which at the best is trick, 
The angry Muse 
Puts confusion in my brain. 
 
But who is he that prates 
Of the culture of mankind, 
Of better arts and life? 
Go, blindworm, go, 
Behold the famous States 
Harrying Mexico 
With rifle and with knife! 
 
Or who, with accent bolder, 
Dare praise the freedom-loving mountaineer? 
I found by thee, O rushing Contoocook! 
And in thy valleys, Agiochook! 
The jackals of the negro-holder. 
 
The God who made New Hampshire 
Taunted the lofty land 
With little men; — 
Small bat and wren 
House in the oak: — 
If earth-fire cleave 
The upheaved land, and bury the folk, 
The southern crocodile would grieve. 
 Virtue palters; Right is hence; 
Freedom praised, but hid; 
Funeral eloquence 
Rattles the coffin-lid. 
 
What boots thy zeal, 
O glowing friend, 
That would indignant rend 
The northland from the south? 
Wherefore? to what good end? 
Boston Bay and Bunker Hill 
Would serve things still; — 
Things are of the snake. 
 
The horseman serves the horse, 
The neat-herd serves the neat, 
The merchant serves the purse,
The eater serves his meat;
'T is the day of the chattel
Web to weave, and corn to grind;
Things are in the saddle,
And ride mankind.
There are two laws discrete,
Not reconciled,—
Law for man, and law for thing;
The last builds town and fleet,
But it runs wild,
And doth the man unking.
'T is fit the forest fall,
The steep be graded,
The mountain tunnelled,
The sand shaded,
The orchard planted,
The glebe tilled,
The prairie granted,
The steamer built.
Let man serve law for man;
Live for friendship, live for love,
For truth's and harmony's behoof;
The state may follow how it can,
As Olympus follows Jove.
 
     Yet do not I implore 
The wrinkled shopman to my sounding woods, 
Nor bid the unwilling senator 
Ask votes of thrushes in the solitudes. 
Every one to his chosen work; — 
Foolish hands may mix and mar; 
Wise and sure the issues are. 
Round they roll till dark is light, 
Sex to sex, and even to odd; — 
The over-god 
Who marries Right to Might, 
Who peoples, unpeoples, — 
He who exterminates 
Races by stronger races, 
Black by white faces, — 
Knows to bring honey 
Out of the lion; 
Grafts gentlest scion 
On pirate and Turk. 
 
The Cossack eats Poland, 
Like stolen fruit; 
Her last noble is ruined, 
Her last poet mute; 
Straight into double band 
The victors divide; 
Half for freedom strike and stand; —

Ralph Waldo Emerson,1803–1882,Ode to Beauty,"Who gave thee, O Beauty, 
The keys of this breast,— 
Too credulous lover 
Of blest and unblest? 
Say, when in lapsed ages 
Thee knew I of old; 
Or what was the service 
For which I was sold? 
When first my eyes saw thee, 
I found me thy thrall, 
By magical drawings, 
Sweet tyrant of all! 
I drank at thy fountain 
False waters of thirst; 
Thou intimate stranger, 
Thou latest and first! 
Thy dangerous glances 
Make women of men; 
New-born, we are melting 
Into nature again. 
 
Lavish, lavish promiser, 
Nigh persuading gods to err! 
Guest of million painted forms, 
Which in turn thy glory warms! 
The frailest leaf, the mossy bark, 
The acorn’s cup, the raindrop’s arc, 
The swinging spider’s silver line, 
The ruby of the drop of wine, 
The shining pebble of the pond, 
Thou inscribest with a bond 
In thy momentary play, 
Would bankrupt nature to repay. 
 
Ah, what avails it 
To hide or to shun 
Whom the Infinite One 
Hath granted his throne? 
The heaven high over 
Is the deep’s lover; 
The sun and sea, 
Informed by thee, 
Before me run 
And draw me on, 
Yet fly me still, 
As Fate refuses 
To me the heart Fate for me chooses. 
Is it that my opulent soul 
Was mingled from the generous whole; 
Sea-valleys and the deep of skies 
Furnished several supplies; 
And the sands whereof I’m made 
Draw me to them, self-betrayed? 
I turn the proud portfolio 
Which holds the grand designs 
Of Salvator, of Guercino, 
And Piranesi’s lines. 
I hear the lofty paeans 
Of the masters of the shell, 
Who heard the starry music 
And recount the numbers well; 
Olympian bards who sung 
Divine Ideas below, 
Which always find us young 
And always keep us so. 
Oft in streets or humblest places, 
I detect far-wandered graces, 
Which, from Eden wide astray, 
In lowly homes have lost their way. 
 
Thee gliding through the sea of form, 
Like the lightning through the storm, 
Somewhat not to be possessed, 
Somewhat not to be caressed, 
No feet so fleet could ever find, 
No perfect form could ever bind. 
Thou eternal fugitive, 
Hovering over all that live, 
Quick and skilful to inspire 
Sweet, extravagant desire, 
Starry space and lily-bell 
Filling with thy roseate smell, 
Wilt not give the lips to taste 
Of the nectar which thou hast. 
 
All that’s good and great with thee 
Works in close conspiracy; 
Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely 
To report thy features only, 
And the cold and purple morning 
Itself with thoughts of thee adorning; 
The leafy dell, the city mart, 
Equal trophies of thine art; 
E’en the flowing azure air 
Thou hast touched for my despair; 
And, if I languish into dreams, 
Again I meet the ardent beams. 
 
Queen of things! I dare not die 
In Being’s deeps past ear and eye; 
Lest there I find the same deceiver. 
And be the sport of Fate forever.

Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me!",ode,types/modes,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Ode']","Source:

Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields, 
Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air 
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven, 
And veils the farm-house at the garden's end. 
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet 
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit 
Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed 
In a tumultuous privacy of storm. 
 
Come see the north wind's masonry. 
Out of an unseen quarry evermore 
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer 
Curves his white bastions with projected roof 
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door. 
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work 
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he 
For number or proportion. Mockingly, 
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths; 
A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn; 
Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall, 
Maugre the farmer's sighs; and, at the gate, 
A tapering turret overtops the work. 
And when his hours are numbered, and the world 
Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,

Susanna Moodie,1803–1885,The Step Mother,"Well I recall my Father’s wife, 
      The day he brought her home. 
His children looked for years of strife, 
      And troubles sure to come— 
Ungraciously we welcomed her, 
      A thing to scorn and blame; 
And swore we never would confer 
      On her, a Mother’s name 
 
I see her yet—a girl in years, 
      With eyes so blue and mild; 
She greeted us with smiles and tears, 
      How sweetly too she smiled— 
She bent to kiss my sullen brow, 
      With woman’s gentle grace; 
And laid her tiny hand of snow 
      On my averted face— 
 
“Henry—is this your son? She said— 
      “Dear boy—he now is mine— 
What not one kiss?—” I shook my head, 
      “I am no son of thine!—” 
She sighed—and from her dimpled cheek 
      The rosy colour fled; 
She turned away and did not speak, 
      My thoughts were with the dead— 
 
There leaped from out my Father’s eyes 
      A jet of swarthy fire; 
That flashed on me in fierce surprise— 
      I fled before his ire 
I heard her gentle voice entreat— 
      “Forgiveness for her sake”— 
Which added swiftness to my feet, 
      A sad and strange mistake— 
 
A year had scarcely rolled away 
      When by that hated bride; 
I loved to linger half the day, 
      In very joy and pride; 
Her voice was music to mine ear, 
      So soft its accent fell; 
“Dear Mother now”—and oh, how dear 
      No words of mine can tell— 
 
She was so gentle, fair and kind, 
      So pure in soul and free from art; 
That woman with her noble mind, 
      Subdued my rebel heart— 
I just had learned to know her worth, 
      My Father’s second choice to bless; 
When God removed her from the earth, 
      And plunged us all in deep distress— 
 
Hot fever smote with burning blight 
      Stretchd on a restless bed of pain; 
I moaning lay from morn till night 
      With aching limbs and throbbing brain— 
Four weary weeks beside my bed, 
      She sat within a darkened room; 
Untiring held my aching head, 
      Nor heeded silence—cold and gloom— 
 
And when my courage quite gave way, 
      And fainter grew my struggling breath; 
She taught my stricken soul to pray 
      And calmly meet approaching death— 
“Fear not God’s angel, sent by Him, 
      The weary spirit to release; 
Before the mortal eyes grow dim,

Anonymous,1803–1885,Mr. Nobody,"I know a funny little man, 
    As quiet as a mouse, 
Who does the mischief that is done 
    In everybody’s house! 
There’s no one ever sees his face, 
    And yet we all agree 
That every plate we break was cracked 
    By Mr. Nobody. 
 
’Tis he who always tears out books, 
    Who leaves the door ajar, 
He pulls the buttons from our shirts, 
    And scatters pins afar; 
That squeaking door will always squeak, 
    For prithee, don’t you see, 
We leave the oiling to be done 
    By Mr. Nobody. 
 
He puts damp wood upon the fire
   That kettles cannot boil;
His are the feet that bring in mud,
   And all the carpets soil.
The papers always are mislaid;
   Who had them last, but he?
There’s no one tosses them about
   But Mr. Nobody.
The finger marks upon the door 
    By none of us are made; 
We never leave the blinds unclosed, 
    To let the curtains fade. 
The ink we never spill;   the boots 
    That lying round you see 
Are not our boots,—they all belong

Susanna Moodie,1803–1885,The Sleigh-Bells,"’Tis merry to hear, at evening time,
By the blazing hearth the sleigh-bells chime;
To know the bounding steeds bring near
The loved one to our bosoms dear.
Ah, lightly we spring the fire to raise,
Till the rafters glow with the ruddy blaze;
Those merry sleigh-bells, our hearts keep time
Responsive to their fairy chime.
Ding-dong, ding-dong, o’er vale and hill,
Their welcome notes are trembling still.

’Tis he, and blithely the gay bells sound,
As his sleigh glides over the frozen ground;
Hark! He has pass’d the dark pine wood,
He crosses now the ice-bound flood,
And hails the light at the open door
That tells his toilsome journey’s o’er.
The merry sleigh-bells! My fond heart swells
And trobs to hear the welcome bells;
Ding-dong, ding-dong, o’er ice and snow,
A voice of gladness, on they go.

Our hut is small, and rude our cheer,
But love has spread the banquet here;
And childhood springs to be caress’d
By our beloved and welcome guest.
With a smiling brow his tale he tells,
The urchins ring the merry sleigh-bells;
The merry sleigh-bells, with shout and song
They drag the noisy string along;
Ding-dong, ding-dong, the father’s come
The gay bells ring his welcome home.

From the cedar swamp the gaunt wolves howl,
From the oak loud whoops the felon owl;
The snow-storm sweeps in thunder past,
The forest creaks beneath the blast;
No more I list, with boding fear,
The sleigh-bells distant chime to hear.
The merry sleigh-bells with soothing power
Shed gladness on the evening hour.
Ding-dong, ding-dong, what rapture swells
The music of those joyous bells!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Home Life', 'Nature', 'Winter', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44773/the-sleigh-bells,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/susanna-moodie,,1803.0,1885.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

         That joyful bark give o’er; 
It wakes the lonely echoes round, 
         But rouses me no more— 
Thy lifted ears, thy swelling chest, 
         Thy eyes so keenly bright, 
No longer kindle in my breast 
         The thrill of fierce delight; 
When following thee on foaming steed 
My eager soul outstripped thy speed— 
 
Lie down—lie down—my faithful hound! 
         And watch this night by me, 
For thee again the horn shall sound 
         By mountain, stream, and tree; 
And thou along the forest glade, 
         Shall track the flying deer 
When cold and silent, I am laid 
         In chill oblivion here. 
Another voice shall cheer thee on, 
And glory when the chase is won. 
 
Lie down—lie down!—my gallant hound! 
         Thy master’s life is sped; 
Go—couch thee on the dewy ground— 
         ’Tis thine to watch the dead. 
But when the blush of early day 
         Is kindling up the sky, 
Then speed thee, faithful friend, away, 
         And to thy mistress hie; 
And guide her to this lonely spot, 
Though my closed eyes behold her not— 
 
Lie down—lie down!—my trusty hound! 
         Death comes, and we must part— 
In my dull ear strange murmurs sound— 
         More faintly throbs my heart; 
The many twinkling lights of heaven 
         Scarce glimmer in the blue— 
Chill round me falls the breath of even, 
         Cold on my brow the dew; 
Earth, stars, and heavens, are lost to sight—

What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,

Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn
Could tread them out to darkness utterly,
It might be well perhaps. But if instead
Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow

Elizabeth Barrett Browning,1806–1861,The Lady's Yes,""" Yes !"" I answered you last night ;
"" No !"" this morning, Sir, I say !
Colours, seen by candle-light,
Will not look the same by day.

When the tabors played their best,
Lamps above, and laughs below —
Love me sounded like a jest,
Fit for Yes or fit for No !

Call me false, or call me free —
Vow, whatever light may shine,
No man on your face shall see
Any grief for change on mine.

Yet the sin is on us both —
Time to dance is not to woo —
Wooer light makes fickle troth —
Scorn of me recoils on you !

Learn to win a lady's faith
Nobly, as the thing is high ;
Bravely, as for life and death —
With a loyal gravity.

Lead her from the festive boards,
Point her to the starry skies,
Guard her, by your truthful words,
Pure from courtship's flatteries.

By your truth she shall be true —
Ever true, as wives of yore —
And her Yes, once said to you,
SHALL be Yes for evermore.",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Ballad']","Elizabeth Barrett Browning, ""The Lady's Yes"" from Poems.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807 – 1882,Nature,"As a fond mother, when the day is o'er,
   Leads by the hand her little child to bed,
   Half willing, half reluctant to be led,
   And leave his broken playthings on the floor,
Still gazing at them through the open door,
   Nor wholly reassured and comforted
   By promises of others in their stead,
   Which, though more splendid, may not please him more;
So Nature deals with us, and takes away
   Our playthings one by one, and by the hand
   Leads us to rest so gently, that we go
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,
   Being too full of sleep to understand
   How far the unknown transcends the what we know.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Aging', 'Childhood']",This poem is in the public domain. ,https://poets.org/poem/nature,https://poets.org/poet/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,2016,1807.0,1882.0,['Sonnet'],"['Aging', 'Childhood']",[],Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,Divina Commedia,"Oft have I seen at some cathedral door 
      A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat, 
      Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet 
      Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor 
Kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er; 
      Far off the noises of the world retreat; 
      The loud vociferations of the street 
      Become an undistinguishable roar. 
So, as I enter here from day to day, 
      And leave my burden at this minster gate, 
      Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray, 
The tumult of the time disconsolate 
      To inarticulate murmurs dies away, 
      While the eternal ages watch and wait. 
 
II 
How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers! 
      This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves 
      Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves 
      Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers, 
And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers! 
      But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves 
      Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves, 
      And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers! 
Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain, 
      What exultations trampling on despair, 
      What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong, 
What passionate outcry of a soul in pain, 
      Uprose this poem of the earth and air, 
      This mediæval miracle of song! 
 
I enter, and I see thee in the gloom 
      Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine! 
      And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine. 
      The air is filled with some unknown perfume; 
The congregation of the dead make room 
      For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine; 
      Like rooks that haunt Ravenna's groves of pine 
      The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb. 
From the confessionals I hear arise 
      Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies, 
      And lamentations from the crypts below; 
And then a voice celestial that begins 
      With the pathetic words, ""Although your sins 
      As scarlet be,"" and ends with ""as the snow."" 
 
With snow-white veil and garments as of flame, 
      She stands before thee, who so long ago 
      Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe 
      From which thy song and all its splendors came; 
And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name, 
      The ice about thy heart melts as the snow 
      On mountain heights, and in swift overflow 
      Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame. 
Thou makest full confession; and a gleam, 
      As of the dawn on some dark forest cast, 
      Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase; 
Lethe and Eunoë — the remembered dream 
      And the forgotten sorrow — bring at last 
      That perfect pardon which is perfect peace. 
 
I lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze 
      With forms of Saints and holy men who died, 
      Here martyred and hereafter glorified; 
      And the great Rose upon its leaves displays 
Christ's Triumph, and the angelic roundelays, 
      With splendor upon splendor multiplied; 
      And Beatrice again at Dante's side 
      No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise. 
And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs 
      Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love 
      And benedictions of the Holy Ghost; 
And the melodious bells among the spires 
      O'er all the house-tops and through heaven above 
      Proclaim the elevation of the Host! 
 
O star of morning and of liberty! 
      O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines 
      Above the darkness of the Apennines, 
      Forerunner of the day that is to be! 
The voices of the city and the sea, 
      The voices of the mountains and the pines, 
      Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines 
      Are footpaths for the thought of Italy! 
Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights, 
      Through all the nations, and a sound is heard, 
      As of a mighty wind, and men devout, 
Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes, 
      In their own language hear thy wondrous word, 
      And many are amazed and many doubt.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Painting & Sculpture', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Sonnet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44630/divina-commedia,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

   The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light. 
Here in this room she died; and soul more white 
   Never through martyrdom of fire was led 
   To its repose; nor can in books be read 
   The legend of a life more benedight. 
There is a mountain in the distant West 
   That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines 
   Displays a cross of snow upon its side. 
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,The Wreck of the Hesperus,"It was the schooner Hesperus, 
      That sailed the wintry sea; 
And the skipper had taken his little daughtèr, 
      To bear him company. 
 
Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax, 
      Her cheeks like the dawn of day, 
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds, 
      That ope in the month of May. 
 
The skipper he stood beside the helm, 
      His pipe was in his mouth, 
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow 
      The smoke now West, now South. 
 
Then up and spake an old Sailòr, 
      Had sailed to the Spanish Main, 
""I pray thee, put into yonder port, 
      For I fear a hurricane. 
 
""Last night, the moon had a golden ring, 
      And to-night no moon we see!"" 
The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe, 
      And a scornful laugh laughed he. 
 
Colder and louder blew the wind, 
      A gale from the Northeast, 
The snow fell hissing in the brine, 
      And the billows frothed like yeast. 
 
Down came the storm, and smote amain 
      The vessel in its strength; 
She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed, 
      Then leaped her cable's length. 
 
""Come hither! come hither! my little daughtèr, 
      And do not tremble so; 
For I can weather the roughest gale 
      That ever wind did blow."" 
 
He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat 
      Against the stinging blast; 
He cut a rope from a broken spar, 
      And bound her to the mast. 
 
""O father! I hear the church-bells ring, 
      Oh say, what may it be?"" 
""'T is a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!"" — 
      And he steered for the open sea. 
 
""O father! I hear the sound of guns, 
      Oh say, what may it be?"" 
""Some ship in distress, that cannot live 
      In such an angry sea!"" 
 
""O father! I see a gleaming light, 
      Oh say, what may it be?"" 
But the father answered never a word, 
      A frozen corpse was he. 
 
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark, 
      With his face turned to the skies, 
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow 
      On his fixed and glassy eyes. 
 
Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed 
      That savèd she might be; 
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave 
      On the Lake of Galilee. 
 
And fast through the midnight dark and drear, 
      Through the whistling sleet and snow, 
Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept 
      Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe. 
 
And ever the fitful gusts between 
      A sound came from the land; 
It was the sound of the trampling surf 
      On the rocks and the hard sea-sand. 
 
The breakers were right beneath her bows, 
      She drifted a dreary wreck, 
And a whooping billow swept the crew 
      Like icicles from her deck. 
 
She struck where the white and fleecy waves 
      Looked soft as carded wool, 
But the cruel rocks, they gored her side 
      Like the horns of an angry bull. 
 
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice, 
      With the masts went by the board; 
Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank, 
      Ho! ho! the breakers roared! 
 
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach, 
      A fisherman stood aghast, 
To see the form of a maiden fair, 
      Lashed close to a drifting mast. 
 
The salt sea was frozen on her breast, 
      The salt tears in her eyes; 
And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed, 
      On the billows fall and rise. 
 
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus, 
      In the midnight and the snow! 
Christ save us all from a death like this, 
      On the reef of Norman's Woe!",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Weather', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44654/the-wreck-of-the-hesperus,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,The Skeleton in Armor,"“Speak! speak! thou fearful guest! 
Who, with thy hollow breast 
Still in rude armor drest, 
      Comest to daunt me! 
Wrapt not in Eastern balms, 
But with thy fleshless palms 
Stretched, as if asking alms, 
      Why dost thou haunt me?” 
 
Then, from those cavernous eyes 
Pale flashes seemed to rise, 
As when the Northern skies 
      Gleam in December; 
And, like the water’s flow 
Under December’s snow, 
Came a dull voice of woe 
      From the heart’s chamber. 
 
“I was a Viking old! 
My deeds, though manifold, 
No Skald in song has told, 
      No Saga taught thee! 
Take heed, that in thy verse 
Thou dost the tale rehearse, 
Else dread a dead man’s curse; 
      For this I sought thee. 
 
“Far in the Northern Land, 
By the wild Baltic’s strand, 
I, with my childish hand, 
      Tamed the gerfalcon; 
And, with my skates fast-bound, 
Skimmed the half-frozen Sound, 
That the poor whimpering hound 
      Trembled to walk on. 
 
“Oft to his frozen lair 
Tracked I the grisly bear, 
While from my path the hare 
      Fled like a shadow; 
Oft through the forest dark 
Followed the were-wolf’s bark, 
Until the soaring lark 
      Sang from the meadow. 
 
“But when I older grew, 
Joining a corsair’s crew, 
O’er the dark sea I flew 
      With the marauders. 
Wild was the life we led; 
Many the souls that sped, 
Many the hearts that bled, 
      By our stern orders. 
 
“Many a wassail-bout 
Wore the long Winter out; 
Often our midnight shout 
      Set the cocks crowing, 
As we the Berserk’s tale 
Measured in cups of ale, 
Draining the oaken pail, 
      Filled to o’erflowing. 
 
“Once as I told in glee 
Tales of the stormy sea, 
Soft eyes did gaze on me, 
      Burning yet tender; 
And as the white stars shine 
On the dark Norway pine, 
On that dark heart of mine 
      Fell their soft splendor. 
 
“I wooed the blue-eyed maid, 
Yielding, yet half afraid, 
And in the forest’s shade 
      Our vows were plighted. 
Under its loosened vest 
Fluttered her little breast, 
Like birds within their nest 
      By the hawk frighted. 
 
“Bright in her father’s hall 
Shields gleamed upon the wall, 
Loud sang the minstrels all, 
      Chanting his glory; 
When of old Hildebrand 
I asked his daughter’s hand, 
Mute did the minstrels stand 
      To hear my story. 
 
“While the brown ale he quaffed, 
Loud then the champion laughed, 
And as the wind-gusts waft 
      The sea-foam brightly, 
So the loud laugh of scorn, 
Out of those lips unshorn, 
From the deep drinking-horn 
      Blew the foam lightly. 
 
“She was a Prince’s child, 
I but a Viking wild, 
And though she blushed and smiled, 
      I was discarded! 
Should not the dove so white 
Follow the sea-mew’s flight, 
Why did they leave that night 
      Her nest unguarded? 
 
“Scarce had I put to sea, 
Bearing the maid with me, 
Fairest of all was she 
      Among the Norsemen! 
When on the white sea-strand, 
Waving his armed hand, 
Saw we old Hildebrand, 
      With twenty horsemen. 
 
“Then launched they to the blast, 
Bent like a reed each mast, 
Yet we were gaining fast, 
      When the wind failed us; 
And with a sudden flaw 
Came round the gusty Skaw, 
So that our foe we saw 
      Laugh as he hailed us. 
 
“And as to catch the gale 
Round veered the flapping sail, 
‘Death!’ was the helmsman’s hail, 
      ‘Death without quarter!’ 
Mid-ships with iron keel 
Struck we her ribs of steel; 
Down her black hulk did reel 
      Through the black water! 
 
“As with his wings aslant, 
Sails the fierce cormorant, 
Seeking some rocky haunt, 
      With his prey laden, — 
So toward the open main, 
Beating to sea again, 
Through the wild hurricane, 
      Bore I the maiden. 
 
“Three weeks we westward bore, 
And when the storm was o’er, 
Cloud-like we saw the shore 
      Stretching to leeward; 
There for my lady’s bower 
Built I the lofty tower, 
Which, to this very hour, 
   Stands looking seaward. 
 
“There lived we many years; 
Time dried the maiden’s tears; 
She had forgot her fears, 
      She was a mother; 
Death closed her mild blue eyes, 
Under that tower she lies; 
Ne’er shall the sun arise 
      On such another! 
 
“Still grew my bosom then, 
Still as a stagnant fen! 
Hateful to me were men, 
      The sunlight hateful! 
In the vast forest here, 
Clad in my warlike gear, 
Fell I upon my spear, 
      Oh, death was grateful! 
 
“Thus, seamed with many scars, 
Bursting these prison bars, 
Up to its native stars 
      My soul ascended! 
There from the flowing bowl 
Deep drinks the warrior’s soul, 
Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!”

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,Sir Humphrey Gilbert,"Southward with fleet of ice 
Sailed the corsair Death; 
Wild and gast blew the blast, 
And the east-wind was his breath. 
 
His lordly ships of ice 
Glisten in the sun; 
On each side, like pennons wide, 
Flashing crystal streamlets run. 
 
His sails of white sea-mist 
Dripped with silver rain; 
But where he passed there were cast 
Leaden shadows o'er the main. 
 
Eastward from Campobello 
Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed; 
Three days or more seaward he bore, 
Then, alas! the land-wind failed. 
 
Alas! the land-wind failed, 
And ice-cold grew the night; 
And nevermore, on sea or shore, 
Should Sir Humphrey see the light. 
 
He sat upon the deck, 
The Book was in his hand; 
""Do not fear! Heaven is as near,"" 
He said, ""by water as by land!"" 
 
In the first watch of the night, 
Without a signal's sound, 
Out of the sea, mysteriously, 
The fleet of Death rose all around. 
 
The moon and the evening star 
Were hanging in the shrouds; 
Every mast, as it passed, 
Seemed to rake the passing clouds. 
 
They grappled with their prize, 
At midnight black and cold! 
As of a rock was the shock; 
Heavily the ground-swell rolled. 
 
Southward through day and dark, 
They drift in cold embrace, 
With mist and rain, o'er the open main; 
Yet there seems no change of place. 
 
Southward, forever southward, 
They drift through dark and day; 
And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream 
Sinking, vanish all away.",ballad,verse forms,"['Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Horror', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44647/sir-humphrey-gilbert,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,Nuremberg,"In the valley of the Pegnitz, where across broad meadow-lands 
Rise the blue Franconian mountains, Nuremberg, the ancient, stands. 
 
Quaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art and song, 
Memories haunt thy pointed gables, like the rooks that round them throng: 
 
Memories of the Middle Ages, when the emperors, rough and bold, 
Had their dwelling in thy castle, time-defying, centuries old; 
 
And thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted, in their uncouth rhyme, 
That their great imperial city stretched its hand through every clime. 
 
In the court-yard of the castle, bound with many an iron band, 
Stands the mighty linden planted by Queen Cunigunde's hand; 
 
On the square the oriel window, where in old heroic days 
Sat the poet Melchior singing Kaiser Maximilian's praise. 
 
Everywhere I see around me rise the wondrous world of Art: 
Fountains wrought with richest sculpture standing in the common mart; 
 
And above cathedral doorways saints and bishops carved in stone, 
By a former age commissioned as apostles to our own. 
 
In the church of sainted Sebald sleeps enshrined his holy dust, 
And in bronze the Twelve Apostles guard from age to age their trust; 
 
In the church of sainted Lawrence stands a pix of sculpture rare, 
Like the foamy sheaf of fountains, rising through the painted air. 
 
Here, when Art was still religion, with a simple, reverent heart, 
Lived and labored Albrecht Dürer, the Evangelist of Art; 
 
Hence in silence and in sorrow, toiling still with busy hand, 
Like an emigrant he wandered, seeking for the Better Land. 
 
Emigravit is the inscription on the tomb-stone where he lies; 
Dead he is not, but departed, — for the artist never dies. 
 
Fairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair, 
That he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air! 
 
Through these streets so broad and stately, these obscure and dismal lanes, 
Walked of yore the Mastersingers, chanting rude poetic strains. 
 
From remote and sunless suburbs came they to the friendly guild, 
Building nests in Fame's great temple, as in spouts the swallows build. 
 
As the weaver plied the shuttle, wove he too the mystic rhyme, 
And the smith his iron measures hammered to the anvil's chime; 
 
Thanking God, whose boundless wisdom makes the flowers of poesy bloom 
In the forge's dust and cinders, in the tissues of the loom. 
 
Here Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, laureate of the gentle craft, 
Wisest of the Twelve Wise Masters, in huge folios sang and laughed. 
 
But his house is now an ale-house, with a nicely sanded floor, 
And a garland in the window, and his face above the door; 
 
Painted by some humble artist, as in Adam Puschman's song, 
As the old man gray and dove-like, with his great beard white and long. 
 
And at night the swart mechanic comes to drown his cark and care, 
Quaffing ale from pewter tankards, in the master's antique chair. 
 
Vanished is the ancient splendor, and before my dreamy eye 
Wave these mingled shapes and figures, like a faded tapestry. 
 
Not thy Councils, not thy Kaisers, win for thee the world's regard; 
But thy painter, Albrecht Dürer, and Hans Sachs thy cobbler bard. 
 
Thus, O Nuremberg, a wanderer from a region far away, 
As he paced thy streets and court-yards, sang in thought his careless lay: 
 
Gathering from the pavement's crevice, as a floweret of the soil, 
The nobility of labor, — the long pedigree of toil.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Architecture & Design', 'Music', 'Painting & Sculpture', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44642/nuremberg,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,The Old Clock on the Stairs,"Somewhat back from the village street 
Stands the old-fashioned country-seat. 
Across its antique portico 
Tall poplar-trees their shadows throw; 
And from its station in the hall 
An ancient timepiece says to all, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
Half-way up the stairs it stands, 
And points and beckons with its hands 
From its case of massive oak, 
Like a monk, who, under his cloak, 
Crosses himself, and sighs, alas! 
With sorrowful voice to all who pass, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
By day its voice is low and light; 
But in the silent dead of night, 
Distinct as a passing footstep's fall, 
It echoes along the vacant hall, 
Along the ceiling, along the floor, 
And seems to say, at each chamber-door, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
Through days of sorrow and of mirth, 
Through days of death and days of birth, 
Through every swift vicissitude 
Of changeful time, unchanged it has stood, 
And as if, like God, it all things saw, 
It calmly repeats those words of awe, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
In that mansion used to be 
Free-hearted Hospitality; 
His great fires up the chimney roared; 
The stranger feasted at his board; 
But, like the skeleton at the feast, 
That warning timepiece never ceased, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
There groups of merry children played, 
There youths and maidens dreaming strayed; 
O precious hours! O golden prime, 
And affluence of love and time! 
Even as a miser counts his gold, 
Those hours the ancient timepiece told, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
From that chamber, clothed in white, 
The bride came forth on her wedding night; 
There, in that silent room below, 
The dead lay in his shroud of snow; 
And in the hush that followed the prayer, 
Was heard the old clock on the stair, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
All are scattered now and fled, 
Some are married, some are dead; 
And when I ask, with throbs of pain, 
""Ah! when shall they all meet again?"" 
As in the days long since gone by, 
The ancient timepiece makes reply, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!"" 
 
Never here, forever there, 
Where all parting, pain, and care, 
And death, and time shall disappear, — 
Forever there, but never here! 
The horologe of Eternity 
Sayeth this incessantly, — 
      ""Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!""",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Time & Brevity', 'Couplet', 'Refrain', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44643/the-old-clock-on-the-stairs,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,Morituri Salutamus: Poem for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Class of 1825 in Bowdoin College,"Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis, 
Et fugiunt freno non remorante dies. 
 Ovid, Fastorum, Lib. vi.

""O Cæsar, we who are about to die 
Salute you!"" was the gladiators' cry 
In the arena, standing face to face 
With death and with the Roman populace. 
 
O ye familiar scenes,—ye groves of pine, 
That once were mine and are no longer mine,— 
Thou river, widening through the meadows green 
To the vast sea, so near and yet unseen,— 
Ye halls, in whose seclusion and repose 
 
Phantoms of fame, like exhalations, rose 
And vanished,—we who are about to die, 
Salute you; earth and air and sea and sky, 
And the Imperial Sun that scatters down 
His sovereign splendors upon grove and town. 
 
Ye do not answer us! ye do not hear! 
We are forgotten; and in your austere 
And calm indifference, ye little care 
Whether we come or go, or whence or where. 
What passing generations fill these halls, 
What passing voices echo from these walls, 
Ye heed not; we are only as the blast, 
A moment heard, and then forever past. 
 
Not so the teachers who in earlier days 
Led our bewildered feet through learning's maze; 
They answer us—alas! what have I said? 
What greetings come there from the voiceless dead? 
What salutation, welcome, or reply? 
What pressure from the hands that lifeless lie? 
They are no longer here; they all are gone 
Into the land of shadows,—all save one. 
Honor and reverence, and the good repute 
That follows faithful service as its fruit, 
Be unto him, whom living we salute. 
 
The great Italian poet, when he made 
His dreadful journey to the realms of shade, 
Met there the old instructor of his youth, 
And cried in tones of pity and of ruth: 
""Oh, never from the memory of my heart 
 
Your dear, paternal image shall depart, 
Who while on earth, ere yet by death surprised, 
Taught me how mortals are immortalized; 
How grateful am I for that patient care 
All my life long my language shall declare."" 
 
To-day we make the poet's words our own, 
And utter them in plaintive undertone; 
Nor to the living only be they said, 
But to the other living called the dead, 
Whose dear, paternal images appear 
Not wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine here; 
Whose simple lives, complete and without flaw, 
Were part and parcel of great Nature's law; 
Who said not to their Lord, as if afraid, 
""Here is thy talent in a napkin laid,"" 
But labored in their sphere, as men who live 
In the delight that work alone can give. 
Peace be to them; eternal peace and rest, 
And the fulfilment of the great behest: 
""Ye have been faithful over a few things, 
Over ten cities shall ye reign as kings."" 
 
And ye who fill the places we once filled, 
And follow in the furrows that we tilled, 
Young men, whose generous hearts are beating high, 
We who are old, and are about to die, 
Salute you; hail you; take your hands in ours, 
And crown you with our welcome as with flowers! 
 
How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams 
With its illusions, aspirations, dreams! 
Book of Beginnings, Story without End, 
Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend! 
Aladdin's Lamp, and Fortunatus' Purse, 
That holds the treasures of the universe! 
All possibilities are in its hands, 
No danger daunts it, and no foe withstands; 
In its sublime audacity of faith, 
""Be thou removed!"" it to the mountain saith, 
And with ambitious feet, secure and proud, 
Ascends the ladder leaning on the cloud! 
 
As ancient Priam at the Scæan gate 
Sat on the walls of Troy in regal state 
With the old men, too old and weak to fight, 
Chirping like grasshoppers in their delight 
To see the embattled hosts, with spear and shield, 
Of Trojans and Achaians in the field; 
So from the snowy summits of our years 
We see you in the plain, as each appears, 
And question of you; asking, ""Who is he 
That towers above the others? Which may be 
Atreides, Menelaus, Odysseus, 
Ajax the great, or bold Idomeneus?"" 
 
Let him not boast who puts his armor on 
As he who puts it off, the battle done. 
Study yourselves; and most of all note well 
Wherein kind Nature meant you to excel. 
Not every blossom ripens into fruit; 
Minerva, the inventress of the flute, 
Flung it aside, when she her face surveyed 
Distorted in a fountain as she played; 
The unlucky Marsyas found it, and his fate 
Was one to make the bravest hesitate. 
 
Write on your doors the saying wise and old, 
""Be bold! be bold!"" and everywhere, ""Be bold; 
Be not too bold!"" Yet better the excess 
Than the defect; better the more than less; 
Better like Hector in the field to die, 
Than like a perfumed Paris turn and fly. 
 
And now, my classmates; ye remaining few 
That number not the half of those we knew, 
Ye, against whose familiar names not yet 
The fatal asterisk of death is set, 
Ye I salute! The horologe of Time 
Strikes the half-century with a solemn chime, 
And summons us together once again, 
The joy of meeting not unmixed with pain. 
 
Where are the others? Voices from the deep 
Caverns of darkness answer me: ""They sleep!"" 
I name no names; instinctively I feel 
Each at some well-remembered grave will kneel, 
And from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss, 
For every heart best knoweth its own loss. 
I see their scattered gravestones gleaming white 
Through the pale dusk of the impending night; 
O'er all alike the impartial sunset throws 
Its golden lilies mingled with the rose; 
We give to each a tender thought, and pass 
Out of the graveyards with their tangled grass, 
Unto these scenes frequented by our feet 
When we were young, and life was fresh and sweet. 
 
What shall I say to you? What can I say 
Better than silence is? When I survey 
This throng of faces turned to meet my own, 
Friendly and fair, and yet to me unknown, 
Transformed the very landscape seems to be; 
It is the same, yet not the same to me. 
So many memories crowd upon my brain, 
So many ghosts are in the wooded plain, 
I fain would steal away, with noiseless tread, 
As from a house where some one lieth dead. 
I cannot go;—I pause;—I hesitate; 
My feet reluctant linger at the gate; 
As one who struggles in a troubled dream 
To speak and cannot, to myself I seem. 
 
Vanish the dream! Vanish the idle fears! 
Vanish the rolling mists of fifty years! 
Whatever time or space may intervene, 
I will not be a stranger in this scene. 
Here every doubt, all indecision, ends; 
Hail, my companions, comrades, classmates, friends! 
 
Ah me! the fifty years since last we met 
Seem to me fifty folios bound and set 
By Time, the great transcriber, on his shelves, 
Wherein are written the histories of ourselves. 
What tragedies, what comedies, are there; 
What joy and grief, what rapture and despair! 
What chronicles of triumph and defeat, 
Of struggle, and temptation, and retreat! 
What records of regrets, and doubts, and fears! 
What pages blotted, blistered by our tears! 
What lovely landscapes on the margin shine, 
What sweet, angelic faces, what divine 
And holy images of love and trust, 
Undimmed by age, unsoiled by damp or dust! 
Whose hand shall dare to open and explore 
These volumes, closed and clasped forevermore? 
Not mine. With reverential feet I pass; 
I hear a voice that cries, ""Alas! alas! 
Whatever hath been written shall remain, 
Nor be erased nor written o'er again; 
The unwritten only still belongs to thee: 
Take heed, and ponder well what that shall be."" 
 
As children frightened by a thunder-cloud 
Are reassured if some one reads aloud 
A tale of wonder, with enchantment fraught, 
Or wild adventure, that diverts their thought, 
Let me endeavor with a tale to chase 
The gathering shadows of the time and place, 
And banish what we all too deeply feel 
Wholly to say, or wholly to conceal. 
 
In mediæval Rome, I know not where, 
There stood an image with its arm in air, 
And on its lifted finger, shining clear, 
A golden ring with the device, ""Strike here!"" 
Greatly the people wondered, though none guessed 
The meaning that these words but half expressed, 
Until a learned clerk, who at noonday 
With downcast eyes was passing on his way, 
Paused, and observed the spot, and marked it well, 
Whereon the shadow of the finger fell; 
And, coming back at midnight, delved, and found 
A secret stairway leading underground. 
Down this he passed into a spacious hall, 
Lit by a flaming jewel on the wall; 
And opposite, in threatening attitude, 
With bow and shaft a brazen statue stood. 
Upon its forehead, like a coronet, 
Were these mysterious words of menace set: 
""That which I am, I am; my fatal aim 
None can escape, not even yon luminous flame!"" 
 
Midway the hall was a fair table placed, 
With cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased 
With rubies, and the plates and knives were gold, 
And gold the bread and viands manifold. 
Around it, silent, motionless, and sad, 
Were seated gallant knights in armor clad, 
And ladies beautiful with plume and zone, 
But they were stone, their hearts within were stone; 
And the vast hall was filled in every part 
With silent crowds, stony in face and heart. 
 
Long at the scene, bewildered and amazed 
The trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed; 
Then from the table, by his greed made bold, 
He seized a goblet and a knife of gold, 
And suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang, 
The vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang, 
The archer sped his arrow, at their call, 
Shattering the lambent jewel on the wall, 
And all was dark around and overhead;— 
Stark on the floor the luckless clerk lay dead! 
 
The writer of this legend then records 
Its ghostly application in these words: 
The image is the Adversary old, 
Whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold; 
Our lusts and passions are the downward stair 
That leads the soul from a diviner air; 
The archer, Death; the flaming jewel, Life; 
Terrestrial goods, the goblet and the knife; 
The knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone 
By avarice have been hardened into stone; 
The clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf 
Tempts from his books and from his nobler self. 
 
The scholar and the world! The endless strife, 
The discord in the harmonies of life! 
The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, 
And all the sweet serenity of books; 
The market-place, the eager love of gain, 
Whose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain! 
 
But why, you ask me, should this tale be told 
To men grown old, or who are growing old? 
It is too late! Ah, nothing is too late 
Till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate. 
Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles 
Wrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides 
Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers, 
When each had numbered more than fourscore years, 
And Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten, 
Had but begun his ""Characters of Men."" 
Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales, 
At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales; 
Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last, 
Completed Faust when eighty years were past. 
These are indeed exceptions; but they show 
How far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow 
Into the arctic regions of our lives, 
Where little else than life itself survives. 
 
As the barometer foretells the storm 
While still the skies are clear, the weather warm 
So something in us, as old age draws near, 
Betrays the pressure of the atmosphere. 
The nimble mercury, ere we are aware, 
Descends the elastic ladder of the air; 
The telltale blood in artery and vein 
Sinks from its higher levels in the brain; 
Whatever poet, orator, or sage 
May say of it, old age is still old age. 
It is the waning, not the crescent moon; 
The dusk of evening, not the blaze of noon; 
It is not strength, but weakness; not desire, 
But its surcease; not the fierce heat of fire, 
The burning and consuming element, 
But that of ashes and of embers spent, 
In which some living sparks we still discern, 
Enough to warm, but not enough to burn. 
 
What then? Shall we sit idly down and say 
The night hath come; it is no longer day? 
The night hath not yet come; we are not quite 
Cut off from labor by the failing light; 
Something remains for us to do or dare; 
Even the oldest tree some fruit may bear; 
Not Oedipus Coloneus, or Greek Ode, 
Or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode 
Out of the gateway of the Tabard Inn, 
But other something, would we but begin; 
For age is opportunity no less 
Than youth itself, though in another dress, 
And as the evening twilight fades away 
The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Growing Old', 'Activities', 'School & Learning', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44639/morituri-salutamus-poem-for-the-fiftieth-anniversary-of-the-class-of-1825-in-bowdoin-college,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,The Wreck of the Hesperus,"It was the schooner Hesperus, 
      That sailed the wintry sea; 
And the skipper had taken his little daughtèr, 
      To bear him company. 
 
Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax, 
      Her cheeks like the dawn of day, 
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds, 
      That ope in the month of May. 
 
The skipper he stood beside the helm, 
      His pipe was in his mouth, 
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow 
      The smoke now West, now South. 
 
Then up and spake an old Sailòr, 
      Had sailed to the Spanish Main, 
""I pray thee, put into yonder port, 
      For I fear a hurricane. 
 
""Last night, the moon had a golden ring, 
      And to-night no moon we see!"" 
The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe, 
      And a scornful laugh laughed he. 
 
Colder and louder blew the wind, 
      A gale from the Northeast, 
The snow fell hissing in the brine, 
      And the billows frothed like yeast. 
 
Down came the storm, and smote amain 
      The vessel in its strength; 
She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed, 
      Then leaped her cable's length. 
 
""Come hither! come hither! my little daughtèr, 
      And do not tremble so; 
For I can weather the roughest gale 
      That ever wind did blow."" 
 
He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat 
      Against the stinging blast; 
He cut a rope from a broken spar, 
      And bound her to the mast. 
 
""O father! I hear the church-bells ring, 
      Oh say, what may it be?"" 
""'T is a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!"" — 
      And he steered for the open sea. 
 
""O father! I hear the sound of guns, 
      Oh say, what may it be?"" 
""Some ship in distress, that cannot live 
      In such an angry sea!"" 
 
""O father! I see a gleaming light, 
      Oh say, what may it be?"" 
But the father answered never a word, 
      A frozen corpse was he. 
 
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark, 
      With his face turned to the skies, 
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow 
      On his fixed and glassy eyes. 
 
Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed 
      That savèd she might be; 
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave 
      On the Lake of Galilee. 
 
And fast through the midnight dark and drear, 
      Through the whistling sleet and snow, 
Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept 
      Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe. 
 
And ever the fitful gusts between 
      A sound came from the land; 
It was the sound of the trampling surf 
      On the rocks and the hard sea-sand. 
 
The breakers were right beneath her bows, 
      She drifted a dreary wreck, 
And a whooping billow swept the crew 
      Like icicles from her deck. 
 
She struck where the white and fleecy waves 
      Looked soft as carded wool, 
But the cruel rocks, they gored her side 
      Like the horns of an angry bull. 
 
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice, 
      With the masts went by the board; 
Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank, 
      Ho! ho! the breakers roared! 
 
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach, 
      A fisherman stood aghast, 
To see the form of a maiden fair, 
      Lashed close to a drifting mast. 
 
The salt sea was frozen on her breast, 
      The salt tears in her eyes; 
And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed, 
      On the billows fall and rise. 
 
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus, 
      In the midnight and the snow! 
Christ save us all from a death like this,

As a feather is wafted downward

I see the lights of the village 
      Gleam through the rain and the mist, 
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me

A feeling of sadness and longing, 
      That is not akin to pain,

Who, through long days of labor,

Still heard in his soul the music 
      Of wonderful melodies. 
 
Such songs have power to quiet

And come like the benediction

Leaden shadows o'er the main. 
 
Eastward from Campobello 
Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed; 
Three days or more seaward he bore, 
Then, alas! the land-wind failed. 
 
Alas! the land-wind failed, 
And ice-cold grew the night; 
And nevermore, on sea or shore, 
Should Sir Humphrey see the light. 
 
He sat upon the deck, 
The Book was in his hand; 
""Do not fear! Heaven is as near,"" 
He said, ""by water as by land!"" 
 
In the first watch of the night, 
Without a signal's sound, 
Out of the sea, mysteriously, 
The fleet of Death rose all around. 
 
The moon and the evening star 
Were hanging in the shrouds; 
Every mast, as it passed, 
Seemed to rake the passing clouds. 
 
They grappled with their prize, 
At midnight black and cold! 
As of a rock was the shock; 
Heavily the ground-swell rolled. 
 
Southward through day and dark, 
They drift in cold embrace, 
With mist and rain, o'er the open main; 
Yet there seems no change of place. 
 
Southward, forever southward, 
They drift through dark and day; 
And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream 
Sinking, vanish all away.",common measure,meters,"['Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Horror', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44647/sir-humphrey-gilbert,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/henry-wadsworth-longfellow,,1807.0,1882.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,1807–1882,The Children's Hour,"Between the dark and the daylight, 
      When the night is beginning to lower, 
Comes a pause in the day's occupations, 
      That is known as the Children's Hour. 
 
I hear in the chamber above me 
      The patter of little feet, 
The sound of a door that is opened, 
      And voices soft and sweet. 
 
From my study I see in the lamplight, 
      Descending the broad hall stair, 
Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, 
      And Edith with golden hair. 
 
A whisper, and then a silence: 
      Yet I know by their merry eyes 
They are plotting and planning together 
      To take me by surprise. 
 
A sudden rush from the stairway, 
      A sudden raid from the hall! 
By three doors left unguarded 
      They enter my castle wall! 
 
They climb up into my turret 
      O'er the arms and back of my chair; 
If I try to escape, they surround me; 
      They seem to be everywhere. 
 
They almost devour me with kisses, 
      Their arms about me entwine, 
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen 
      In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine! 
 
Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti, 
      Because you have scaled the wall, 
Such an old mustache as I am 
      Is not a match for you all! 
 
I have you fast in my fortress, 
      And will not let you depart, 
But put you down into the dungeon 
      In the round-tower of my heart. 
 
And there will I keep you forever,

John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,Skipper Ireson’s Ride,"Of all the rides since the birth of time,
Told in story or sung in rhyme, —
On Apuleius’s Golden Ass,
Or one-eyed Calender’s horse of brass,
Witch astride of a human back,
Islam’s prophet on Al-Borák, —
The strangest ride that ever was sped
Was Ireson’s, out from Marblehead!
   Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,
   Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
       By the women of Marblehead!

Body of turkey, head of owl,
Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl,
Feathered and ruffled in every part,
Skipper Ireson stood in the cart.
Scores of women, old and young,
Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue,
Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane,
Shouting and singing the shrill refrain:
   “Here ’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,
   Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt
       By the women o’ Morble’ead!”

Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips,
Girls in bloom of cheek and lips,
Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase
Bacchus round some antique vase,
Brief of skirt, with ankles bare,
Loose of kerchief and loose of hair,
With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns’ twang,
Over and over the Mænads sang:
   “Here ’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,
   Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt
       By the women o’ Morble’ead!”

Small pity for him! — He sailed away
From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay, —
Sailed away from a sinking wreck,
With his own town’s-people on her deck!
“Lay by! lay by!” they called to him.
Back he answered, “Sink or swim!
Brag of your catch of fish again!”
And off he sailed through the fog and rain!
   Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,
   Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
       By the women of Marblehead!

Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur
That wreck shall lie forevermore.
Mother and sister, wife and maid,
Looked from the rocks of Marblehead
Over the moaning and rainy sea, —
Looked for the coming that might not be!
What did the winds and the sea-birds say
Of the cruel captain who sailed away? —
   Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,
   Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
       By the women of Marblehead!

Through the street, on either side,
Up flew windows, doors swung wide;
Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray,
Treble lent the fish-horn’s bray.
Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound,
Hulks of old sailors run aground,
Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane,
And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain:
   “Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,
   Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt
       By the women o’ Morble’ead!”

Sweetly along the Salem road
Bloom of orchard and lilac showed.
Little the wicked skipper knew
Of the fields so green and the sky so blue.
Riding there in his sorry trim,
Like an Indian idol glum and grim,
Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear
Of voices shouting, far and near:
   “Here’s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,
   Torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt
       By the women o’ Morble’ead!”

“Hear me, neighbors!” at last he cried, —
“What to me is this noisy ride?
What is the shame that clothes the skin
To the nameless horror that lives within?
Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck,
And hear a cry from a reeling deck!
Hate me and curse me, — I only dread
The hand of God and the face of the dead!”
   Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,
   Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
       By the women of Marblehead!

Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea
Said, “God has touched him! why should we!”
Said an old wife mourning her only son,
“Cut the rogue’s tether and let him run!”
So with soft relentings and rude excuse,
Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose,
And gave him a cloak to hide him in,
And left him alone with his shame and sin.

John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,What the Birds Said,"The birds against the April wind
 Flew northward, singing as they flew;
They sang, “The land we leave behind
 Has swords for corn-blades, blood for dew.”

“O wild-birds, flying from the South,
 What saw and heard ye, gazing down?”
“We saw the mortar’s upturned mouth,
 The sickened camp, the blazing town!

“Beneath the bivouac’s starry lamps,
 We saw your march-worn children die;
In shrouds of moss, in cypress swamps,
 We saw your dead uncoffined lie.

“We heard the starving prisoner’s sighs
 And saw, from line and trench, your sons
Follow our flight with home-sick eyes
 Beyond the battery’s smoking guns.”

“And heard and saw ye only wrong
 And pain,” I cried, “O wing-worn flocks?”
“We heard,” they sang, “the freedman’s song,
 The crash of Slavery’s broken locks!

“We saw from new, uprising States
 The treason-nursing mischief spurned,
As, crowding Freedom’s ample gates,
 The long-estranged and lost returned.

“O’er dusky faces, seamed and old,
 And hands horn-hard with unpaid toil,
With hope in every rustling fold,
 We saw your star-dropt flag uncoil.

“And struggling up through sounds accursed,
 A grateful murmur clomb the air;
A whisper scarcely heard at first,
 It filled the listening heavens with prayer.

“And sweet and far, as from a star,
 Replied a voice which shall not cease,
Till, drowning all the noise of war,
 It sings the blessed song of peace!”

So to me, in a doubtful day
 Of chill and slowly greening spring,
Low stooping from the cloudy gray,
 The wild-birds sang or seemed to sing.

They vanished in the misty air,
 The song went with them in their flight;
But lo! they left the sunset fair,
 And in the evening there was light.",ballad,verse forms,"['Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Race & Ethnicity', 'War & Conflict', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45492/what-the-birds-said,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-greenleaf-whittier,,1807.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,The Barefoot Boy,"Blessings on thee, little man, 
Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan! 
With thy turned-up pantaloons, 
And thy merry whistled tunes; 
With thy red lip, redder still 
Kissed by strawberries on the hill; 
With the sunshine on thy face, 
Through thy torn brim’s jaunty grace; 
From my heart I give thee joy,— 
I was once a barefoot boy! 
Prince thou art,—the grown-up man 
Only is republican. 
Let the million-dollared ride! 
Barefoot, trudging at his side, 
Thou hast more than he can buy 
In the reach of ear and eye,— 
Outward sunshine, inward joy: 
Blessings on thee, barefoot boy! 
 
Oh for boyhood’s painless play, 
Sleep that wakes in laughing day, 
Health that mocks the doctor’s rules, 
Knowledge never learned of schools, 
Of the wild bee’s morning chase, 
Of the wild-flower’s time and place, 
Flight of fowl and habitude 
Of the tenants of the wood; 
How the tortoise bears his shell, 
How the woodchuck digs his cell, 
And the ground-mole sinks his well; 
How the robin feeds her young, 
How the oriole’s nest is hung; 
Where the whitest lilies blow, 
Where the freshest berries grow, 
Where the ground-nut trails its vine, 
Where the wood-grape’s clusters shine; 
Of the black wasp’s cunning way, 
Mason of his walls of clay, 
And the architectural plans 
Of gray hornet artisans! 
For, eschewing books and tasks, 
Nature answers all he asks; 
Hand in hand with her he walks, 
Face to face with her he talks, 
Part and parcel of her joy,— 
Blessings on the barefoot boy! 
 
Oh for boyhood’s time of June, 
Crowding years in one brief moon, 
When all things I heard or saw, 
Me, their master, waited for. 
I was rich in flowers and trees, 
Humming-birds and honey-bees; 
For my sport the squirrel played, 
Plied the snouted mole his spade; 
For my taste the blackberry cone 
Purpled over hedge and stone; 
Laughed the brook for my delight 
Through the day and through the night, 
Whispering at the garden wall, 
Talked with me from fall to fall; 
Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond, 
Mine the walnut slopes beyond, 
Mine, on bending orchard trees, 
Apples of Hesperides! 
Still as my horizon grew, 
Larger grew my riches too; 
All the world I saw or knew 
Seemed a complex Chinese toy, 
Fashioned for a barefoot boy! 
 
Oh for festal dainties spread, 
Like my bowl of milk and bread; 
Pewter spoon and bowl of wood, 
On the door-stone, gray and rude! 
O’er me, like a regal tent, 
Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent, 
Purple-curtained, fringed with gold, 
Looped in many a wind-swung fold; 
While for music came the play 
Of the pied frogs’ orchestra; 
And, to light the noisy choir, 
Lit the fly his lamp of fire. 
I was monarch: pomp and joy 
Waited on the barefoot boy! 
 
Cheerily, then, my little man, 
Live and laugh, as boyhood can! 
Though the flinty slopes be hard, 
Stubble-speared the new-mown sward, 
Every morn shall lead thee through 
Fresh baptisms of the dew; 
Every evening from thy feet 
Shall the cool wind kiss the heat: 
All too soon these feet must hide 
In the prison cells of pride, 
Lose the freedom of the sod, 
Like a colt’s for work be shod, 
Made to tread the mills of toil, 
Up and down in ceaseless moil: 
Happy if their track be found 
Never on forbidden ground; 
Happy if they sink not in 
Quick and treacherous sands of sin. 
Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy, 
Ere it passes, barefoot boy!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Time & Brevity', 'Activities', 'Sports & Outdoor Activities', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45484/the-barefoot-boy,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-greenleaf-whittier,,1807.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,Barbara Frietchie,"Up from the meadows rich with corn,
Clear in the cool September morn,

The clustered spires of Frederick stand
Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.

Round about them orchards sweep,
Apple- and peach-tree fruited deep,

Fair as a garden of the Lord
To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,

On that pleasant morn of the early fall
When Lee marched over the mountain wall,—

Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.

Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,

Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
Of noon looked down, and saw not one.

Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;

Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down;

In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.

Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.

Under his slouched hat left and right
He glanced: the old flag met his sight.

“Halt!”— the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
“Fire!”— out blazed the rifle-blast.

It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash.

Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;

She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.

“Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country’s flag,” she said.

A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;

The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman’s deed and word:

“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
Dies like a dog! March on!” he said.

All day long through Frederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet:

All day long that free flag tost
Over the heads of the rebel host.

Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well;

And through the hill-gaps sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night.

Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.

Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier.

Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!

Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law;

And ever the stars above look down

John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,My Triumph,"The autumn-time has come;
On woods that dream of bloom,
And over purpling vines,
The low sun fainter shines.

The aster-flower is failing,
The hazel’s gold is paling;
Yet overhead more near
The eternal stars appear!

And present gratitude
Insures the future’s good,
And for the things I see
I trust the things to be;

That in the paths untrod,
And the long days of God,
My feet shall still be led,
My heart be comforted.

O living friends who love me!
O dear ones gone above me!
Careless of other fame,
I leave to you my name.

Hide it from idle praises,
Save it from evil phrases:
Why, when dear lips that spake it
Are dumb, should strangers wake it?

Let the thick curtain fall;
I better know than all
How little I have gained,
How vast the unattained.

Not by the page word-painted
Let life be banned or sainted:
Deeper than written scroll
The colors of the soul.

Sweeter than any sung
My songs that found no tongue;
Nobler than any fact
My wish that failed of act.

Others shall sing the song,
Others shall right the wrong,—
Finish what I begin,
And all I fail of win.

What matter, I or they?
Mine or another’s day,
So the right word be said
And life the sweeter made?

Hail to the coming singers!
Hail to the brave light-bringers!
Forward I reach and share
All that they sing and dare.

The airs of heaven blow o’er me;
A glory shines before me
Of what mankind shall be,—
Pure, generous, brave, and free.

A dream of man and woman
Diviner but still human,
Solving the riddle old,
Shaping the Age of Gold!

The love of God and neighbor;
An equal-handed labor;
The richer life, where beauty
Walks hand in hand with duty.

Ring, bells in unreared steeples,
The joy of unborn peoples!
Sound, trumpets far off blown,
Your triumph is my own!

Parcel and part of all,
I keep the festival,
Fore-reach the good to be,
And share the victory.

I feel the earth move sunward,
I join the great march onward,
And take, by faith, while living,
My freehold of thanksgiving.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Time & Brevity', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45488/my-triumph,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-greenleaf-whittier,,1807.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,An Autograph,"I write my name as one, 
On sands by waves o’errun 
Or winter’s frosted pane, 
Traces a record vain. 
 
Oblivion’s blankness claims 
Wiser and better names, 
And well my own may pass 
As from the strand or glass. 
 
Wash on, O waves of time! 
Melt, noons, the frosty rime! 
Welcome the shadow vast, 
The silence that shall last! 
 
When I and all who know 
And love me vanish so, 
What harm to them or me 
Will the lost memory be? 
 
If any words of mine, 
Through right of life divine, 
Remain, what matters it 
Whose hand the message writ? 
 
Why should the “crowner’s quest” 
Sit on my worst or best? 
Why should the showman claim 
The poor ghost of my name? 
 
Yet, as when dies a sound 
Its spectre lingers round, 
Haply my spent life will 
Leave some faint echo still. 
 
A whisper giving breath 
Of praise or blame to death, 
Soothing or saddening such 
As loved the living much. 
 
Therefore with yearnings vain 
And fond I still would fain 
A kindly judgment seek, 
A tender thought bespeak. 
 
And, while my words are read, 
Let this at least be said: 
“Whate’er his life’s defeatures, 
He loved his fellow-creatures. 
 
“If, of the Law’s stone table, 
To hold he scarce was able 
The first great precept fast, 
He kept for man the last. 
 
“Through mortal lapse and dulness 
What lacks the Eternal Fulness, 
If still our weakness can 
Love Him in loving man? 
 
“Age brought him no despairing 
Of the world’s future faring; 
In human nature still 
He found more good than ill. 
 
“To all who dumbly suffered, 
His tongue and pen he offered; 
His life was not his own, 
Nor lived for self alone. 
 
“Hater of din and riot 
He lived in days unquiet; 
And, lover of all beauty, 
Trod the hard ways of duty.

He sought the good of many, 
Yet knew both sin and folly,— 
May God forgive him wholly!”",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Time & Brevity', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45482/an-autograph,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-greenleaf-whittier,,1807.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.

Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,

Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
Of noon looked down, and saw not one.

Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;

Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down;

In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.

Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.

Under his slouched hat left and right
He glanced: the old flag met his sight.

“Halt!”— the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
“Fire!”— out blazed the rifle-blast.

It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash.

Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;

She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.

“Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country’s flag,” she said.

A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;

The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman’s deed and word:

“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
Dies like a dog! March on!” he said.

All day long through Frederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet:

All day long that free flag tost
Over the heads of the rebel host.

Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well;

And through the hill-gaps sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night.

Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.

Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier.

Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!

Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law;

And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below in Frederick town!",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']",n/a,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45483/barbara-frietchie,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-greenleaf-whittier,,1807.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
John Greenleaf Whittier,1807–1892,The Worship of Nature,"The harp at Nature’s advent strung 
      Has never ceased to play; 
The song the stars of morning sung 
      Has never died away. 
 
And prayer is made, and praise is given, 
      By all things near and far; 
The ocean looketh up to heaven, 
      And mirrors every star. 
 
Its waves are kneeling on the strand, 
      As kneels the human knee, 
Their white locks bowing to the sand, 
      The priesthood of the sea! 
 
They pour their glittering treasures forth, 
      Their gifts of pearl they bring, 
And all the listening hills of earth 
      Take up the song they sing. 
 
The green earth sends its incense up 
      From many a mountain shrine; 
From folded leaf and dewy cup 
      She pours her sacred wine. 
 
The mists above the morning rills 
      Rise white as wings of prayer; 
The altar-curtains of the hills 
      Are sunset’s purple air. 
 
The winds with hymns of praise are loud, 
      Or low with sobs of pain,— 
The thunder-organ of the cloud, 
      The dropping tears of rain. 
 
With drooping head and branches crossed 
      The twilight forest grieves, 
Or speaks with tongues of Pentecost 
      From all its sunlit leaves. 
 
The blue sky is the temple’s arch, 
      Its transept earth and air, 
The music of its starry march 
      The chorus of a prayer. 
 
So Nature keeps the reverent frame 
      With which her years began, 
And all her signs and voices shame 
      The prayerless heart of man.",common measure,meters,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Religion', 'Other Religions', 'The Spiritual', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45493/the-worship-of-nature,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-greenleaf-whittier,,1807.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson ",1809 – 1892,In Memoriam A. H. H.," 
Strong Son of God, immortal Love,
   Whom we, that have not seen thy face,
   By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
Believing where we cannot prove;
 
Thine are these orbs of light and shade;
   Thou madest Life in man and brute;
   Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot
Is on the skull which thou hast made.
 
Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:
Thou madest man, he knows not why,
He thinks he was not made to die;
And thou hast made him: thou art just.
 
Thou seemest human and divine,
   The highest, holiest manhood, thou.
   Our wills are ours, we know not how;
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.
 
Our little systems have their day;
   They have their day and cease to be:
   They are but broken lights of thee,
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.
 
We have but faith: we cannot know;
   For knowledge is of things we see
   And yet we trust it comes from thee,
A beam in darkness: let it grow.
 
Let knowledge grow from more to more,
   But more of reverence in us dwell;
   That mind and soul, according well,
May make one music as before,
 
But vaster. We are fools and slight;
   We mock thee when we do not fear:
   But help thy foolish ones to bear;
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.
 
Forgive what seem'd my sin in me;
   What seem'd my worth since I began;
   For merit lives from man to man,
And not from man, O Lord, to thee.
 
Forgive my grief for one removed,
   Thy creature, whom I found so fair.
   I trust he lives in thee, and there
I find him worthier to be loved.
 
Forgive these wild and wandering cries,
   Confusions of a wasted youth;
   Forgive them where they fail in truth,
And in thy wisdom make me wise.
 
I
I held it truth, with him who sings
   To one clear harp in divers tones,
   That men may rise on stepping-stones
Of their dead selves to higher things.
 
But who shall so forecast the years
   And find in loss a gain to match?
   Or reach a hand thro' time to catch
The far-off interest of tears?
 
Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown'd,
   Let darkness keep her raven gloss:
   Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss,
To dance with death, to beat the ground,
 
Than that the victor Hours should scorn
   The long result of love, and boast,
   `Behold the man that loved and lost,
But all he was is overworn.'
 
II
Old Yew, which graspest at the stones
   That name the under-lying dead,
   Thy fibres net the dreamless head,
Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.
 
The seasons bring the flower again,
   And bring the firstling to the flock;
   And in the dusk of thee, the clock
Beats out the little lives of men.
 
O, not for thee the glow, the bloom,
   Who changest not in any gale,
   Nor branding summer suns avail
To touch thy thousand years of gloom:
 
And gazing on thee, sullen tree,
   Sick for thy stubborn hardihood,
   I seem to fail from out my blood
And grow incorporate into thee.
 
III
O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
   O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
   O sweet and bitter in a breath,
What whispers from thy lying lip?
 
'The stars,' she whispers, `blindly run;
   A web is wov'n across the sky;
   From out waste places comes a cry,
And murmurs from the dying sun:
 
'And all the phantom, Nature, stands—
   With all the music in her tone,
   A hollow echo of my own,—
A hollow form with empty hands.'
 
And shall I take a thing so blind,
   Embrace her as my natural good;
   Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
Upon the threshold of the mind?
 
IV
To Sleep I give my powers away;
   My will is bondsman to the dark;
   I sit within a helmless bark,
And with my heart I muse and say:
 
O heart, how fares it with thee now,
   That thou should'st fail from thy desire,
   Who scarcely darest to inquire,
'What is it makes me beat so low?'
 
Something it is which thou hast lost,
   Some pleasure from thine early years.
   Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears,
That grief hath shaken into frost!
 
Such clouds of nameless trouble cross
   All night below the darken'd eyes;
   With morning wakes the will, and cries, 
'Thou shalt not be the fool of loss.'
 
V
I sometimes hold it half a sin
   To put in words the grief I feel;
   For words, like Nature, half reveal
And half conceal the Soul within.
 
But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
   A use in measured language lies;
   The sad mechanic exercise,
Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.
 
In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,
   Like coarsest clothes against the cold:
   But that large grief which these enfold
Is given in outline and no more.
 
VI
One writes, that `Other friends remain,'
   That `Loss is common to the race'—
   And common is the commonplace,
And vacant chaff well meant for grain.
 
That loss is common would not make
   My own less bitter, rather more:
   Too common! Never morning wore
To evening, but some heart did break.
 
O father, wheresoe'er thou be,
   Who pledgest now thy gallant son;
   A shot, ere half thy draught be done,
Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.
 
O mother, praying God will save
   Thy sailor,—while thy he",elegy,types/modes,"['Elegy', 'Grief']",This poem is in the public domain.

"Alfred, Lord Tennyson ",1809 – 1892,Ulysses,"It little profits that an idle king,
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race,
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart
Much have I seen and known—cities of men
And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honored of them all,—
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move.
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!
As though to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little, and of one to me
Little remains; but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more,
A bringer of new things; and vile it were
For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
And this gray spirit yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
   This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
To whom I leave the scepter and the isle,
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild
A rugged people, and through soft degrees
Subdue them to the useful and the good.
Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere
Of common duties, decent not to fail
In offices of tenderness, and pay
Meet adoration to my household gods,
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
   There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,
That ever with a frolic welcome took
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
Death closes all; but something ere the end,
Some work of noble note, may yet be done, 
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Dramatic Monologue', 'Heroes', 'Myth', 'Public Domain']","This poem is in the public domain.

Edgar Allan Poe,1809–1849,To -- -- --. Ulalume: A Ballad,"The skies they were ashen and sober; 
      The leaves they were crispéd and sere— 
      The leaves they were withering and sere; 
It was night in the lonesome October 
      Of my most immemorial year; 
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber, 
      In the misty mid region of Weir— 
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber, 
      In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. 
 
Here once, through an alley Titanic, 
      Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul— 
      Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul. 
These were days when my heart was volcanic 
      As the scoriac rivers that roll— 
      As the lavas that restlessly roll 
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek 
      In the ultimate climes of the pole— 
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek 
      In the realms of the boreal pole. 
 
Our talk had been serious and sober, 
      But our thoughts they were palsied and sere— 
      Our memories were treacherous and sere— 
For we knew not the month was October, 
      And we marked not the night of the year— 
      (Ah, night of all nights in the year!) 
We noted not the dim lake of Auber— 
      (Though once we had journeyed down here)— 
We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber, 
      Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. 
 
And now, as the night was senescent 
      And star-dials pointed to morn— 
      As the star-dials hinted of morn— 
At the end of our path a liquescent 
      And nebulous lustre was born, 
Out of which a miraculous crescent 
      Arose with a duplicate horn— 
Astarte's bediamonded crescent 
      Distinct with its duplicate horn. 
 
And I said—""She is warmer than Dian: 
      She rolls through an ether of sighs— 
      She revels in a region of sighs: 
She has seen that the tears are not dry on 
      These cheeks, where the worm never dies, 
And has come past the stars of the Lion 
      To point us the path to the skies— 
      To the Lethean peace of the skies— 
Come up, in despite of the Lion, 
      To shine on us with her bright eyes— 
Come up through the lair of the Lion, 
      With love in her luminous eyes."" 
 
But Psyche, uplifting her finger, 
      Said—""Sadly this star I mistrust— 
      Her pallor I strangely mistrust:— 
Oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger! 
      Oh, fly!—let us fly!—for we must."" 
In terror she spoke, letting sink her 
      Wings till they trailed in the dust— 
In agony sobbed, letting sink her 
      Plumes till they trailed in the dust— 
      Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust. 
 
I replied—""This is nothing but dreaming: 
      Let us on by this tremulous light! 
      Let us bathe in this crystalline light! 
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming 
      With Hope and in Beauty to-night:— 
      See!—it flickers up the sky through the night! 
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming, 
      And be sure it will lead us aright— 
We safely may trust to a gleaming 
      That cannot but guide us aright, 
      Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."" 
 
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her, 
      And tempted her out of her gloom— 
      And conquered her scruples and gloom: 
And we passed to the end of the vista, 
      But were stopped by the door of a tomb— 
      By the door of a legended tomb; 
And I said—""What is written, sweet sister, 
      On the door of this legended tomb?"" 
      She replied—""Ulalume—Ulalume— 
      'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"" 
 
Then my heart it grew ashen and sober 
      As the leaves that were crispèd and sere— 
      As the leaves that were withering and sere, 
And I cried—""It was surely October 
      On this very night of last year 
      That I journeyed—I journeyed down here— 
      That I brought a dread burden down here— 
      On this night of all nights in the year, 
      Oh, what demon has tempted me here? 
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber— 
      This misty mid region of Weir— 
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber— 
      In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."" 
 
Said we, then—the two, then—""Ah, can it 
      Have been that the woodlandish ghouls— 
      The pitiful, the merciful ghouls— 
To bar up our way and to ban it 
      From the secret that lies in these wolds— 
      From the thing that lies hidden in these wolds— 
Had drawn up the spectre of a planet 
      From the limbo of lunary souls— 
This sinfully scintillant planet 
      From the Hell of the planetary souls?""",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Time & Brevity', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Horror', 'Ballad']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44889/to-ulalume-a-ballad,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/edgar-allan-poe,,1809.0,1849.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Edgar Allan Poe,1809–1849,Annabel Lee,"It was many and many a year ago, 
   In a kingdom by the sea, 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
   By the name of Annabel Lee; 
And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
   Than to love and be loved by me. 
 
I was a child and she was a child, 
   In this kingdom by the sea, 
But we loved with a love that was more than love— 
   I and my Annabel Lee— 
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven 
   Coveted her and me. 
 
And this was the reason that, long ago, 
   In this kingdom by the sea, 
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
   My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
So that her highborn kinsmen came 
   And bore her away from me, 
To shut her up in a sepulchre 
   In this kingdom by the sea. 
 
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 
   Went envying her and me— 
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, 
   In this kingdom by the sea) 
That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. 
 
But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
   Of those who were older than we— 
   Of many far wiser than we— 
And neither the angels in Heaven above 
   Nor the demons down under the sea 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
 
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, 
   In her sepulchre there by the sea— 
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.",ballad,verse forms,"['Suitable for Children', 'Suitable for Teens', 'Related Audio', 'Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Classic Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Horror', 'Ballad']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44885/annabel-lee,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/edgar-allan-poe,,1809.0,1849.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Edgar Allan Poe,1809–1849,The Sleeper,"At midnight, in the month of June, 
I stand beneath the mystic moon. 
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim, 
Exhales from out her golden rim, 
And softly dripping, drop by drop, 
Upon the quiet mountain top, 
Steals drowsily and musically 
Into the universal valley. 
The rosemary nods upon the grave; 
The lily lolls upon the wave; 
Wrapping the fog about its breast, 
The ruin moulders into rest; 
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake 
A conscious slumber seems to take, 
And would not, for the world, awake. 
All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies 
Irene, with her Destinies! 
 
Oh, lady bright! can it be right— 
This window open to the night? 
The wanton airs, from the tree-top, 
Laughingly through the lattice drop— 
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout, 
Flit through thy chamber in and out, 
And wave the curtain canopy 
So fitfully—so fearfully— 
Above the closed and fringéd lid 
’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid, 
That, o’er the floor and down the wall, 
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! 
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? 
Why and what art thou dreaming here? 
Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas, 
A wonder to these garden trees! 
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress! 
Strange, above all, thy length of tress, 
And this all solemn silentness! 
 
The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, 
Which is enduring, so be deep! 
Heaven have her in its sacred keep! 
This chamber changed for one more holy, 
This bed for one more melancholy, 
I pray to God that she may lie 
Forever with unopened eye, 
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by! 
 
My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, 
As it is lasting, so be deep! 
Soft may the worms about her creep! 
Far in the forest, dim and old, 
For her may some tall vault unfold— 
Some vault that oft hath flung its black 
And wingéd pannels fluttering back, 
Triumphant, o’er the crested palls 
Of her grand family funerals— 
 
Some sepulchre, remote, alone, 
Against whose portals she hath thrown, 
In childhood, many an idle stone— 
Some tomb from out whose sounding door 
She ne’er shall force an echo more, 
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin! 
It was the dead who groaned within.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Stars, Planets, Heavens', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Ghosts & the Supernatural', 'Couplet']","Source:

Edgar Allan Poe,1809–1849,The Valley of Unrest,"Once it smiled a silent dell 
Where the people did not dwell; 
They had gone unto the wars, 
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars, 
Nightly, from their azure towers, 
To keep watch above the flowers, 
In the midst of which all day 
The red sun-light lazily lay. 
Now each visitor shall confess 
The sad valley’s restlessness. 
Nothing there is motionless— 
Nothing save the airs that brood 
Over the magic solitude. 
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees 
That palpitate like the chill seas 
Around the misty Hebrides! 
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven 
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven 
Uneasily, from morn till even, 
Over the violets there that lie 
In myriad types of the human eye— 
Over the lilies there that wave 
And weep above a nameless grave! 
They wave:—from out their fragrant tops

Edgar Allan Poe,1809–1849,Dream-Land,"By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   
On a black throne reigns upright, 
I have reached these lands but newly   
From an ultimate dim Thule— 
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, 
       Out of SPACE—Out of TIME. 
 
Bottomless vales and boundless floods,   
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   
With forms that no man can discover   
For the tears that drip all over;   
Mountains toppling evermore   
Into seas without a shore;   
Seas that restlessly aspire,   
Surging, unto skies of fire;   
Lakes that endlessly outspread   
Their lone waters—lone and dead,—   
Their still waters—still and chilly   
With the snows of the lolling lily. 
 
By the lakes that thus outspread 
Their lone waters, lone and dead,— 
Their sad waters, sad and chilly 
With the snows of the lolling lily,— 
By the mountains—near the river   
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—   
By the grey woods,—by the swamp   
Where the toad and the newt encamp,—   
By the dismal tarns and pools 
   Where dwell the Ghouls,—   
By each spot the most unholy—   
In each nook most melancholy,—   
There the traveller meets, aghast,   
Sheeted Memories of the Past—   
Shrouded forms that start and sigh   
As they pass the wanderer by—   
White-robed forms of friends long given,   
In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven. 
 
For the heart whose woes are legion   
’T is a peaceful, soothing region—   
For the spirit that walks in shadow   
’T is—oh, ’t is an Eldorado! 
But the traveller, travelling through it,   
May not—dare not openly view it;   
Never its mysteries are exposed   
To the weak human eye unclosed;   
So wills its King, who hath forbid   
The uplifting of the fring'd lid;   
And thus the sad Soul that here passes   
Beholds it but through darkened glasses. 
 
By a route obscure and lonely,   
Haunted by ill angels only, 
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, 
On a black throne reigns upright,   
I have wandered home but newly

Edgar Allan Poe,1809–1849,“Alone”,"From childhood’s hour I have not been 
As others were—I have not seen 
As others saw—I could not bring 
My passions from a common spring— 
From the same source I have not taken 
My sorrow—I could not awaken 
My heart to joy at the same tone— 
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— 
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn 
Of a most stormy life—was drawn 
From ev’ry depth of good and ill 
The mystery which binds me still— 
From the torrent, or the fountain— 
From the red cliff of the mountain— 
From the sun that ’round me roll’d 
In its autumn tint of gold— 
From the lightning in the sky 
As it pass’d me flying by— 
From the thunder, and the storm— 
And the cloud that took the form 
(When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
Of a demon in my view—",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Coming of Age', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']","Source:

But a waking dream of life and light

On things around him with a ray
    Turned back upon the past?

Hath cheered me as a lovely beam

Abraham Lincoln,1809–1865,The Bear Hunt,"A wild-bear chace, didst never see?
   Then hast thou lived in vain.
Thy richest bump of glorious glee,
   Lies desert in thy brain.

When first my father settled here,
   ’Twas then the frontier line:
The panther’s scream, filled night with fear
   And bears preyed on the swine.

But woe for Bruin’s short lived fun,
   When rose the squealing cry;
Now man and horse, with dog and gun,
   For vengeance, at him fly.

A sound of danger strikes his ear;
   He gives the breeze a snuff;
Away he bounds, with little fear,
   And seeks the tangled rough.

On press his foes, and reach the ground,
   Where’s left his half munched meal;
The dogs, in circles, scent around,
   And find his fresh made trail.

With instant cry, away they dash,
   And men as fast pursue;
O’er logs they leap, through water splash,
   And shout the brisk halloo.

Now to elude the eager pack,
   Bear shuns the open ground;
Through matted vines, he shapes his track
   And runs it, round and round.

The tall fleet cur, with deep-mouthed voice,
   Now speeds him, as the wind;
While half-grown pup, and short-legged fice,
   Are yelping far behind.

And fresh recruits are dropping in
   To join the merry corps:
With yelp and yell,—a mingled din—
   The woods are in a roar.

And round, and round the chace now goes,
   The world’s alive with fun;
Nick Carter’s horse, his rider throws,
   And more, Hill drops his gun.

Now sorely pressed, bear glances back,
   And lolls his tired tongue;
When as, to force him from his track,
   An ambush on him sprung.

Across the glade he sweeps for flight,
   And fully is in view.
The dogs, new-fired, by the sight,
   Their cry, and speed, renew.

The foremost ones, now reach his rear,
   He turns, they dash away;
And circling now, the wrathful bear,
   They have him full at bay.

At top of speed, the horse-men come,
   All screaming in a row,
“Whoop! Take him Tiger. Seize him Drum.”
   Bang,—bang—the rifles go.

And furious now, the dogs he tears,
   And crushes in his ire,
Wheels right and left, and upward rears,
   With eyes of burning fire.

But leaden death is at his heart,
   Vain all the strength he plies.
And, spouting blood from every part,
   He reels, and sinks, and dies.

And now a dinsome clamor rose,
   ’Bout who should have his skin;
Who first draws blood, each hunter knows,
   This prize must always win.

But who did this, and how to trace
   What’s true from what’s a lie,
Like lawyers, in a murder case
   They stoutly argufy.

Aforesaid fice, of blustering mood,
   Behind, and quite forgot,
Just now emerging from the wood,
   Arrives upon the spot.

With grinning teeth, and up-turned hair—
   Brim full of spunk and wrath,
He growls, and seizes on dead bear,
   And shakes for life and death.

And swells as if his skin would tear,
   And growls and shakes again;
And swears, as plain as dog can swear,
   That he has won the skin.

"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,Locksley Hall,"Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early morn:
Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle-horn.

'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,
Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;

Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,
And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.

Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,
Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.

Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.

Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime
With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;

When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;
When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:

When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;
Saw the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be.—

In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;
In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;

In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.

Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,
And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.

And I said, ""My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,
Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee.""

On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,
As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.

And she turn'd—her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs—
All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes—

Saying, ""I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong"";
Saying, ""Dost thou love me, cousin?"" weeping, ""I have loved thee long.""

Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;
Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.

Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.

Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,
And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.

Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,
And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.

O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!
O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!

Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,
Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!

Is it well to wish thee happy?—having known me—to decline
On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!

Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower to his level day by day,
What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay.

As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,
And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.

He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,
Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.

What is this? his eyes are heavy; think not they are glazed with wine.
Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss him, take his hand in thine.

It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:
Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.

He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand—
Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!

Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,
Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.

Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!
Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!

Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!
Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!

Well—'t is well that I should bluster!—Hadst thou less unworthy proved—
Would to God—for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.

Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?
I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.

Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come
As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.

Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?
Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?

I remember one that perish'd; sweetly did she speak and move;
Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.

Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?
No—she never loved me truly; love is love for evermore.

Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,
That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.

Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,
In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.

Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,
Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.

Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,
To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.

Thou shalt hear the ""Never, never,"" whisper'd by the phantom years,
And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;

And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.
Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest again.

Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry.
'T is a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble dry.

Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee rest.
Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.

O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.
Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.

O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,
With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.

""They were dangerous guides the feelings—she herself was not exempt—
Truly, she herself had suffer'd""—Perish in thy self-contempt!

Overlive it—lower yet—be happy! wherefore should I care?
I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.

What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?
Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.

Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.
I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do?

I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,
When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound.

But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels,
And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.

Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.
Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!

Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,
When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;

Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,
Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,

And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,
Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;

And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,
Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men:

Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:
That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:

For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;

Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,
Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales;

Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;

Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,
With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;

Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.

There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.

So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,
Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;

Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint:
Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point:

Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,
Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.

Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,
And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.

What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,
Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?

Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,
And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.

Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,
Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.

Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,
They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:

Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string?
I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.

Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain—
Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:

Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine,
Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine—

Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat
Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;

Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd,—
I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.

Or to burst all links of habit—there to wander far away,
On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.

Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,
Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.

Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,
Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;

Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree—
Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.

There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind,
In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.

There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing space;
I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.

Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run,
Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;

Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks,
Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books—

Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are wild,
But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.

I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains,
Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!

Mated with a squalid savage—what to me were sun or clime?
I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time—

I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,
Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!

Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,
Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.

Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day;
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.

Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:
Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun.

O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set.
Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.

Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!
Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.

Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,
Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.

Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;
For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45362/locksley-hall,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

All along the valley, where thy waters flow,
I walk'd with one I loved two and thirty years ago.
All along the valley, while I walk'd to-day,
The two and thirty years were a mist that rolls away;
For all along the valley, down thy rocky bed,
Thy living voice to me was as the voice of the dead,
And all along the valley, by rock and cave and tree,
The voice of the dead was a living voice to me.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45358/in-the-valley-of-cauteretz,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Are not these, O Soul, the Vision of Him who reigns?

Is not the Vision He, tho' He be not that which He seems?
Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?

Earth, these solid stars, this weight of body and limb,
Are they not sign and symbol of thy division from Him?

Dark is the world to thee; thyself art the reason why,
For is He not all but thou, that hast power to feel ""I am I""?

Glory about thee, without thee; and thou fulfillest thy doom,
Making Him broken gleams and a stifled splendour and gloom.

Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet-
Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet.

God is law, say the wise; O soul, and let us rejoice,
For if He thunder by law the thunder is yet His voice.

Law is God, say some; no God at all, says the fool,
For all we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool;

"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,Oenone,"There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier 
Than all the valleys of Ionian hills. 
The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen, 
Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine, 
And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand 
The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down 
Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars 
The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine 
In cataract after cataract to the sea. 
Behind the valley topmost Gargarus 
Stands up and takes the morning: but in front 
The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal 
Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel, 
The crown of Troas. 
 
                               Hither came at noon 
Mournful Oenone, wandering forlorn 
Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills. 
Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck 
Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest. 
She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine, 
Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade 
Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff. 
 
""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
For now the noonday quiet holds the hill: 
The grasshopper is silent in the grass: 
The lizard, with his shadow on the stone, 
Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead. 
The purple flower droops: the golden bee 
Is lily-cradled: I alone awake. 
My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love, 
My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim, 
And I am all aweary of my life. 
 
""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Hear me, O Earth, hear me, O Hills, O Caves 
That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain brooks, 
I am the daughter of a River-God, 
Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all 
My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls 
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed, 
A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be 
That, while I speak of it, a little while 
My heart may wander from its deeper woe. 
 
      ""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
I waited underneath the dawning hills, 
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark, 
And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine: 
Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris, 
Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved, 
Came up from reedy Simois all alone. 
 
      ""O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft: 
Far up the solitary morning smote 
The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes 
I sat alone: white-breasted like a star 
Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin 
Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair 
Cluster'd about his temples like a God's: 
And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens 
When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart 
Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came. 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm 
Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold, 
That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd 
And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech 
Came down upon my heart. 
 
                                     My own Oenone, 
Beautiful-brow'd Oenone, my own soul, 
Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n 
""For the most fair,"" would seem to award it thine, 
As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt 
The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace 
Of movement, and the charm of married brows.' 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
He prest the blossom of his lips to mine, 
And added 'This was cast upon the board, 
When all the full-faced presence of the Gods 
Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon 
Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due: 
But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve, 
Delivering that to me, by common voice 
Elected umpire, Herè comes to-day, 
Pallas and Aphroditè, claiming each 
This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave 
Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine, 
Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard 
Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.' 
 
""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud 
Had lost his way between the piney sides 
Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came, 
Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower, 
And at their feet the crocus brake like fire, 
Violet, amaracus, and asphodel, 
Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose, 
And overhead the wandering ivy and vine, 
This way and that, in many a wild festoon 
Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs 
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'. 
 
      ""O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit, 
And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd 
Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew. 
Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom 
Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows 
Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods 
Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made 
Proffer of royal power, ample rule 
Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue 
Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale 
And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn, 
Or labour'd mine undrainable of ore. 
Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll, 
From many an inland town and haven large, 
Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel 
In glassy bays among her tallest towers.' 
 
      ""O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Still she spake on and still she spake of power, 
'Which in all action is the end of all; 
Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred 
And throned of wisdom—from all neighbour crowns 
Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand 
Fail from the sceptre-staff. Such boon from me, 
From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris, to thee king-born, 
A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born, 
Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power 
Only, are likest Gods, who have attain'd 
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats 
Above the thunder, with undying bliss 
In knowledge of their own supremacy.' 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit 
Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power 
Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood 
Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs 
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear 
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold, 
The while, above, her full and earnest eye 
Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek 
Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply. 
 
      ""Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control, 
These three alone lead life to sovereign power. 
Yet not for power (power of herself 
Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law, 
Acting the law we live by without fear; 
And, because right is right, to follow right 
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.' 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts. 
Sequel of guerdon could not alter me 
To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am, 
So shalt thou find me fairest. 
 
                                              Yet, indeed, 
If gazing on divinity disrobed 
Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair, 
Unbias'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure 
That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee, 
So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood, 
Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's, 
To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks, 
Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow 
Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will, 
Circled thro' all experiences, pure law, 
Commeasure perfect freedom.' 
 
                                           Here she ceas'd 
And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris, 
Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not, 
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me! 
 
      ""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Idalian Aphroditè beautiful, 
Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells, 
With rosy slender fingers backward drew 
From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair 
Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat 
And shoulder: from the violets her light foot 
Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form 
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches 
Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved. 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes, 
The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh 
Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee 
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.' 
She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear: 
But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm, 
And I beheld great Herè's angry eyes, 
As she withdrew into the golden cloud, 
And I was left alone within the bower; 
And from that time to this I am alone, 
And I shall be alone until I die. 
 
      ""Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Fairest—why fairest wife? am I not fair? 
My love hath told me so a thousand times. 
Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday, 
When I past by, a wild and wanton pard, 
Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail 
Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she? 
Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms 
Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest 
Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew 
Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains 
Flash in the pools of whirling Simois! 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
They came, they cut away my tallest pines, 
My tall dark pines, that plumed the craggy ledge 
High over the blue gorge, and all between 
The snowy peak and snow-white cataract 
Foster'd the callow eaglet—from beneath 
Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn 
The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat 
Low in the valley. Never, never more 
Shall lone OEnone see the morning mist 
Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid 
With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud, 
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars. 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds, 
Among the fragments tumbled from the glens, 
Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her 
The Abominable, that uninvited came 
Into the fair Pele{:i}an banquet-hall, 
And cast the golden fruit upon the board, 
And bred this change; that I might speak my mind, 
And tell her to her face how much I hate 
Her presence, hated both of Gods and men. 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times, 
In this green valley, under this green hill, 
Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone? 
Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears? 
O happy tears, and how unlike to these! 
O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face? 
O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight? 
O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud, 
There are enough unhappy on this earth, 
Pass by the happy souls, that love to live: 
I pray thee, pass before my light of life, 
And shadow all my soul, that I may die. 
Thou weighest heavy on the heart within, 
Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die. 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts 
Do shape themselves within me, more and more, 
Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear 
Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills, 
Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see 
My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother 
Conjectures of the features of her child 
Ere it is born: her child!—a shudder comes 
Across me: never child be born of me, 
Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes! 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone, 
Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me 
Walking the cold and starless road of death 
Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love 
With the Greek woman. I will rise and go 
Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth 
Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says 
A fire dances before her, and a sound 
Rings ever in her ears of armed men. 
What this may be I know not, but I know 
That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day, 
All earth and air seem only burning fire.""",pastoral,types/modes,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Pastoral', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45373/oenone,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?
But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease
To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,
To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;
And come, for Love is of the valley, come,
For Love is of the valley, come thou down
And find him; by the happy threshold, he,
Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,
Or red with spirted purple of the vats,
Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk
With Death and Morning on the silver horns,
Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,
Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,

To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:
But follow; let the torrent dance thee down
To find him in the valley; let the wild
Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave
The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill
Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,
That like a broken purpose waste in air:
So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales

Arise to thee; the children call, and I

         Whom we, that have not seen thy face, 
         By faith, and faith alone, embrace, 
Believing where we cannot prove; 
 
Thine are these orbs of light and shade; 
         Thou madest Life in man and brute; 
         Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot 
Is on the skull which thou hast made. 
 
Thou wilt not leave us in the dust: 
         Thou madest man, he knows not why, 
         He thinks he was not made to die; 
And thou hast made him: thou art just. 
 
Thou seemest human and divine, 
         The highest, holiest manhood, thou. 
         Our wills are ours, we know not how, 
Our wills are ours, to make them thine. 
 
Our little systems have their day; 
         They have their day and cease to be: 
         They are but broken lights of thee, 
And thou, O Lord, art more than they. 
 
We have but faith: we cannot know; 
         For knowledge is of things we see; 
         And yet we trust it comes from thee, 
A beam in darkness: let it grow. 
 
Let knowledge grow from more to more, 
         But more of reverence in us dwell; 
         That mind and soul, according well, 
May make one music as before, 
 
But vaster. We are fools and slight; 
         We mock thee when we do not fear: 
         But help thy foolish ones to bear; 
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light. 
 
Forgive what seem'd my sin in me, 
         What seem'd my worth since I began; 
         For merit lives from man to man, 
And not from man, O Lord, to thee. 
 
Forgive my grief for one removed, 
         Thy creature, whom I found so fair. 
         I trust he lives in thee, and there 
I find him worthier to be loved.

Half a league, half a league,
Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death

“Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns!” he said.
Into the valley of Death

“Forward, the Light Brigade!”
Was there a man dismayed?
Not though the soldier knew
   Someone had blundered.
   Theirs not to make reply,
   Theirs not to reason why,
   Theirs but to do and die.

   Rode the six hundred.

Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
   Volleyed and thundered;
Stormed at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of hell
   Rode the six hundred.

IV
Flashed all their sabres bare,
Flashed as they turned in air
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
   All the world wondered.
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right through the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reeled from the sabre stroke
   Shattered and sundered.
Then they rode back, but not
   Not the six hundred.

V
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
   Volleyed and thundered;
Stormed at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell.
They that had fought so well
Came through the jaws of Death,
Back from the mouth of hell,
All that was left of them,
   Left of six hundred.

O the wild charge they made!

"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,Oenone,"There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier 
Than all the valleys of Ionian hills. 
The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen, 
Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine, 
And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand 
The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down 
Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars 
The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine 
In cataract after cataract to the sea. 
Behind the valley topmost Gargarus 
Stands up and takes the morning: but in front 
The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal 
Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel, 
The crown of Troas. 
 
                               Hither came at noon 
Mournful Oenone, wandering forlorn 
Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills. 
Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck 
Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest. 
She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine, 
Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade 
Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff. 
 
""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
For now the noonday quiet holds the hill: 
The grasshopper is silent in the grass: 
The lizard, with his shadow on the stone, 
Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead. 
The purple flower droops: the golden bee 
Is lily-cradled: I alone awake. 
My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love, 
My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim, 
And I am all aweary of my life. 
 
""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Hear me, O Earth, hear me, O Hills, O Caves 
That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain brooks, 
I am the daughter of a River-God, 
Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all 
My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls 
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed, 
A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be 
That, while I speak of it, a little while 
My heart may wander from its deeper woe. 
 
      ""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
I waited underneath the dawning hills, 
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark, 
And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine: 
Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris, 
Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved, 
Came up from reedy Simois all alone. 
 
      ""O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft: 
Far up the solitary morning smote 
The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes 
I sat alone: white-breasted like a star 
Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin 
Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair 
Cluster'd about his temples like a God's: 
And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens 
When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart 
Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came. 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm 
Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold, 
That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd 
And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech 
Came down upon my heart. 
 
                                     My own Oenone, 
Beautiful-brow'd Oenone, my own soul, 
Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n 
""For the most fair,"" would seem to award it thine, 
As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt 
The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace 
Of movement, and the charm of married brows.' 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
He prest the blossom of his lips to mine, 
And added 'This was cast upon the board, 
When all the full-faced presence of the Gods 
Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon 
Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due: 
But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve, 
Delivering that to me, by common voice 
Elected umpire, Herè comes to-day, 
Pallas and Aphroditè, claiming each 
This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave 
Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine, 
Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard 
Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.' 
 
""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud 
Had lost his way between the piney sides 
Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came, 
Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower, 
And at their feet the crocus brake like fire, 
Violet, amaracus, and asphodel, 
Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose, 
And overhead the wandering ivy and vine, 
This way and that, in many a wild festoon 
Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs 
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'. 
 
      ""O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit, 
And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd 
Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew. 
Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom 
Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows 
Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods 
Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made 
Proffer of royal power, ample rule 
Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue 
Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale 
And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn, 
Or labour'd mine undrainable of ore. 
Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll, 
From many an inland town and haven large, 
Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel 
In glassy bays among her tallest towers.' 
 
      ""O mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Still she spake on and still she spake of power, 
'Which in all action is the end of all; 
Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred 
And throned of wisdom—from all neighbour crowns 
Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand 
Fail from the sceptre-staff. Such boon from me, 
From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris, to thee king-born, 
A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born, 
Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power 
Only, are likest Gods, who have attain'd 
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats 
Above the thunder, with undying bliss 
In knowledge of their own supremacy.' 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit 
Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power 
Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood 
Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs 
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear 
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold, 
The while, above, her full and earnest eye 
Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek 
Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply. 
 
      ""Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control, 
These three alone lead life to sovereign power. 
Yet not for power (power of herself 
Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law, 
Acting the law we live by without fear; 
And, because right is right, to follow right 
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.' 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts. 
Sequel of guerdon could not alter me 
To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am, 
So shalt thou find me fairest. 
 
                                              Yet, indeed, 
If gazing on divinity disrobed 
Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair, 
Unbias'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure 
That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee, 
So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood, 
Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's, 
To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks, 
Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow 
Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will, 
Circled thro' all experiences, pure law, 
Commeasure perfect freedom.' 
 
                                           Here she ceas'd 
And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris, 
Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not, 
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me! 
 
      ""O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, 
Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Idalian Aphroditè beautiful, 
Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells, 
With rosy slender fingers backward drew 
From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair 
Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat 
And shoulder: from the violets her light foot 
Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form 
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches 
Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved. 
 
      ""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes, 
The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh 
Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee 
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.' 
She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear: 
But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm, 
And I beheld great Herè's angry eyes, 
As she withdrew into the golden cloud, 
And I was left alone within the bower; 
And from that time to this I am alone, 
And I shall be alone until I die. 
 
      ""Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die. 
Fairest—why fairest wife? am I not fair? 
My love hath told me so a thousand times. 
Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday, 
When I past by, a wild and wanton pard, 
Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail 
Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she? 
Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms 
Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest 
Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew 
Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains 
Flash in the pools of whirling Simois! 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
They came, they cut away my tallest pines, 
My tall dark pines, that plumed the craggy ledge 
High over the blue gorge, and all between 
The snowy peak and snow-white cataract 
Foster'd the callow eaglet—from beneath 
Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn 
The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat 
Low in the valley. Never, never more 
Shall lone OEnone see the morning mist 
Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid 
With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud, 
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars. 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds, 
Among the fragments tumbled from the glens, 
Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her 
The Abominable, that uninvited came 
Into the fair Pele{:i}an banquet-hall, 
And cast the golden fruit upon the board, 
And bred this change; that I might speak my mind, 
And tell her to her face how much I hate 
Her presence, hated both of Gods and men. 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times, 
In this green valley, under this green hill, 
Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone? 
Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears? 
O happy tears, and how unlike to these! 
O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face? 
O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight? 
O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud, 
There are enough unhappy on this earth, 
Pass by the happy souls, that love to live: 
I pray thee, pass before my light of life, 
And shadow all my soul, that I may die. 
Thou weighest heavy on the heart within, 
Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die. 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts 
Do shape themselves within me, more and more, 
Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear 
Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills, 
Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see 
My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother 
Conjectures of the features of her child 
Ere it is born: her child!—a shudder comes 
Across me: never child be born of me, 
Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes! 
 
      ""O mother, hear me yet before I die. 
Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone, 
Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me 
Walking the cold and starless road of death 
Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love 
With the Greek woman. I will rise and go 
Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth 
Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says 
A fire dances before her, and a sound 
Rings ever in her ears of armed men. 
What this may be I know not, but I know 
That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day, 
All earth and air seem only burning fire.""",blank verse,meters,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Pastoral', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45373/oenone,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,Morte d'Arthur,"So all day long the noise of battle roll'd 
Among the mountains by the winter sea; 
Until King Arthur's table, man by man, 
Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord, 
King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep, 
The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him, 
Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights, 
And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, 
A broken chancel with a broken cross, 
That stood on a dark strait of barren land. 
On one side lay the ocean, and on one 
Lay a great water, and the moon was full. 
 
         Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: 
""The sequel of to-day unsolders all 
The goodliest fellowship of famous knights 
Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep 
They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we 
Shall never more, at any future time, 
Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, 
Walking about the gardens and the halls 
Of Camelot, as in the days that were. 
I perish by this people which I made,— 
Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again 
To rule once more—but let what will be, be, 
I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm 
That without help I cannot last till morn. 
Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, 
Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how 
In those old days, one summer noon, an arm 
Rose up from out the bosom of the lake, 
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, 
Holding the sword—and how I row'd across 
And took it, and have worn it, like a king: 
And, wheresoever I am sung or told 
In aftertime, this also shall be known: 
But now delay not: take Excalibur, 
And fling him far into the middle mere: 
Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."" 
 
         To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus, 
Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. 
A little thing may harm a wounded man. 
Yet I thy hest will all perform at full, 
Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."" 
 
         So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept 
And in the moon athwart the place of tombs, 
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, 
Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang 
Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down 
By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, 
Came on the shining levels of the lake. 
 
         There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, 
And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, 
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth 
And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: 
For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, 
Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work 
Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long 
That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, 
This way and that dividing the swift mind, 
In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd 
Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd 
There in the many-knotted water-flags, 
That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. 
So strode he back slow to the wounded King. 
 
         Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: 
""Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? 
What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"" 
 
         And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, 
And the wild water lapping on the crag."" 
 
         To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale: 
""Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, 
Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd 
Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: 
For surer sign had follow'd, either hand, 
Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. 
This is a shameful thing for men to lie. 
Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again 
As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing 
I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."" 
 
         Then went Sir Bedivere the second time 
Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, 
Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought; 
But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, 
How curiously and strangely chased, he smote 
His palms together, and he cried aloud, 
 
         ""And if indeed I cast the brand away, 
Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, 
Should thus be lost forever from the earth, 
Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. 
What good should follow this, if this were done? 
What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, 
Seeing obedience is the bond of rule. 
Were it well to obey then, if a king demand 
An act unprofitable, against himself? 
The King is sick, and knows not what he does. 
What record, or what relic of my lord 
Should be to aftertime, but empty breath 
And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, 
Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, 
Some one might show it at a joust of arms, 
Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, 
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake; 
Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps 
Upon the hidden bases of the hills.' 
So might some old man speak in the aftertime 
To all the people, winning reverence. 
But now much honour and much fame were lost."" 
 
         So spake he, clouded with his own conceit, 
And hid Excalibur the second time, 
And so strode back slow to the wounded King. 
 
         Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: 
""What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?"" 
 
         And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""I heard the water lapping on the crag, 
And the long ripple washing in the reeds."" 
 
         To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: 
""Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, 
Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! 
Authority forgets a dying king, 
Laid widow'd of the power in his eye 
That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, 
For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, 
In whom should meet the offices of all, 
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; 
Either from lust of gold, or like a girl 
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. 
Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, 
And the third time may prosper, get thee hence: 
But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, 
I will arise and slay thee with my hands."" 
 
         Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, 
And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged 
Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, 
And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand 
Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, 
And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, 
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, 
Seen where the moving isles of winter shock 
By night, with noises of the northern sea. 
So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: 
But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm 
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, 
And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him 
Three times, and drew him under in the mere. 
And lightly went the other to the King. 
 
         Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: 
""Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. 
Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"" 
 
         And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems 
Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, 
Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, 
Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, 
So great a miracle as yonder hilt. 
Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; 
But when I look'd again, behold an arm, 
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, 
That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him 
Three times, and drew him under in the mere."" 
 
         And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: 
""My end draws nigh; 't is time that I were gone. 
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, 
And bear me to the margin; yet I fear 
My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."" 
 
         So saying, from the pavement he half rose, 
Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, 
And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes 
As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere 
Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, 
And would have spoken, but he found not words, 
Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, 
O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, 
And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. 
 
         But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, 
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed 
When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King 
Muttering and murmuring at his ear, ""Quick, quick! 
I fear it is too late, and I shall die."" 
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, 
Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd 
Larger than human on the frozen hills. 
He heard the deep behind him, and a cry 
Before. His own thought drove him like a goad. 
Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves 
And barren chasms, and all to left and right 
The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based 
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang 
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— 
And on a sudden, lo! the level lake, 
And the long glories of the winter moon. 
 
         Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge 
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, 
Beneath them; and descending they were ware 
That all the decks were dense with stately forms 
Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these 
Three Queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose 
A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, 
And, as it were one voice, an agony 
Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills 
All night in a waste land, where no one comes, 
Or hath come, since the making of the world. 
 
         Then murmur'd Arthur, ""Place me in the barge,"" 
And to the barge they came. There those three Queens 
Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. 
But she that rose the tallest of them all 
And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, 
And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, 
And call'd him by his name, complaining loud 
And dropping bitter tears against his brow 
Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white 
And colourless, and like the wither'd moon 
Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; 
And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops 
Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls— 
That made his forehead like a rising sun 
High from the daïs-throne—were parch'd with dust; 
Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, 
Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. 
So like a shatter'd column lay the King; 
Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, 
From spur to plume a star of tournament, 
Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged 
Before the eyes of ladies and of kings. 
 
         Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? 
Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? 
For now I see the true old times are dead, 
When every morning brought a noble chance, 
And every chance brought out a noble knight. 
Such times have been not since the light that led 
The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. 
But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved 
Which was an image of the mighty world; 
And I, the last, go forth companionless, 
And the days darken round me, and the years, 
Among new men, strange faces, other minds."" 
 
         And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: 
""The old order changeth, yielding place to new, 
And God fulfils Himself in many ways, 
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. 
Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? 
I have lived my life, and that which I have done 
May He within Himself make pure! but thou, 
If thou shouldst never see my face again, 
Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer 
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice 
Rise like a fountain for me night and day. 
For what are men better than sheep or goats 
That nourish a blind life within the brain, 
If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer 
Both for themselves and those who call them friend? 
For so the whole round earth is every way 
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. 
But now farewell. I am going a long way 
With these thou seëst—if indeed I go— 
(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) 
To the island-valley of Avilion; 
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, 
Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies 
Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns 
And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, 
Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."" 
 
         So said he, and the barge with oar and sail 
Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan 
That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, 
Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood 
With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere 
Revolving many memories, till the hull 
Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, 
And on the mere the wailing died away.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Fairy-tales & Legends', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45370/morte-darthur,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,Ulysses,"It little profits that an idle king, 
By this still hearth, among these barren crags, 
Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole 
Unequal laws unto a savage race, 
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. 
I cannot rest from travel: I will drink 
Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd 
Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those 
That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when 
Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades 
Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; 
For always roaming with a hungry heart 
Much have I seen and known; cities of men 
And manners, climates, councils, governments, 
Myself not least, but honour'd of them all; 
And drunk delight of battle with my peers, 
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. 
I am a part of all that I have met; 
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' 
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades 
For ever and forever when I move. 
How dull it is to pause, to make an end, 
To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! 
As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life 
Were all too little, and of one to me 
Little remains: but every hour is saved 
From that eternal silence, something more, 
A bringer of new things; and vile it were 
For some three suns to store and hoard myself, 
And this gray spirit yearning in desire 
To follow knowledge like a sinking star, 
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. 
 
         This is my son, mine own Telemachus, 
To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,— 
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil 
This labour, by slow prudence to make mild 
A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees 
Subdue them to the useful and the good. 
Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere 
Of common duties, decent not to fail 
In offices of tenderness, and pay 
Meet adoration to my household gods, 
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine. 
 
         There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: 
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, 
Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me— 
That ever with a frolic welcome took 
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed 
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old; 
Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; 
Death closes all: but something ere the end, 
Some work of noble note, may yet be done, 
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. 
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: 
The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep 
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 
'T is not too late to seek a newer world. 
Push off, and sitting well in order smite 
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
Of all the western stars, until I die. 
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' 
We are not now that strength which in old days 
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath, 
And after many a summer dies the swan. 
Me only cruel immortality 
Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms,

Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.

So glorious in his beauty and thy choice, 
Who madest him thy chosen, that he seem'd 
To his great heart none other than a God!

Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile, 
Like wealthy men, who care not how they give. 
But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills, 
And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me, 
And tho' they could not end me, left me maim'd 
To dwell in presence of immortal youth,

Close over us, the silver star, thy guide, 
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears 
To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift: 
Why should a man desire in any way 
To vary from the kindly race of men 
Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance 
Where all should pause, as is most meet for all?

A glimpse of that dark world where I was born. 
Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals 
From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure, 
And bosom beating with a heart renew'd. 
Thy cheek begins to redden thro' the gloom, 
Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine, 
Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team 
Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise, 
And shake the darkness from their loosen'd manes, 
And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.

In silence, then before thine answer given 
Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.

And make me tremble lest a saying learnt, 
In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true? 
'The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.'

In days far-off, and with what other eyes 
I used to watch—if I be he that watch'd— 
The lucid outline forming round thee; saw 
The dim curls kindle into sunny rings; 
Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood 
Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd all 
Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay, 
Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm 
With kisses balmier than half-opening buds 
Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss'd 
Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet, 
Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing, 
While Ilion like a mist rose into towers. 
 
         Yet hold me not for ever in thine East: 
How can my nature longer mix with thine? 
Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold 
Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet 
Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam 
Floats up from those dim fields about the homes 
Of happy men that have the power to die, 
And grassy barrows of the happier dead. 
Release me, and restore me to the ground; 
Thou seëst all things, thou wilt see my grave: 
Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn; 
I earth in earth forget these empty courts, 
And thee returning on thy silver wheels.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Blank Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45389/tithonus,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,from Idylls of the King: The Passing of Arthur,"That story which the bold Sir Bedivere, 
First made and latest left of all the knights, 
Told, when the man was no more than a voice 
In the white winter of his age, to those 
With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds. 
 
       For on their march to westward, Bedivere, 
Who slowly paced among the slumbering host, 
Heard in his tent the moanings of the King: 
 
       ""I found Him in the shining of the stars, 
I mark'd Him in the flowering of His fields, 
But in His ways with men I find Him not. 
I waged His wars, and now I pass and die. 
O me! for why is all around us here 
As if some lesser god had made the world, 
But had not force to shape it as he would, 
Till the High God behold it from beyond, 
And enter it, and make it beautiful? 
Or else as if the world were wholly fair, 
But that these eyes of men are dense and dim, 
And have not power to see it as it is: 
Perchance, because we see not to the close;— 
For I, being simple, thought to work His will, 
And have but stricken with the sword in vain; 
And all whereon I lean'd in wife and friend 
Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm 
Reels back into the beast, and is no more. 
My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death: 
Nay—God my Christ—I pass but shall not die."" 
 
       Then, ere that last weird battle in the west, 
There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain kill'd 
In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown 
Along a wandering wind, and past his ear 
Went shrilling, ""Hollow, hollow all delight! 
Hail, King! to-morrow thou shalt pass away. 
Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee. 
And I am blown along a wandering wind, 
And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight."" 
And fainter onward, like wild birds that change 
Their season in the night and wail their way 
From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream 
Shrill'd; but in going mingled with dim cries 
Far in the moonlit haze among the hills, 
As of some lonely city sack'd by night, 
When all is lost, and wife and child with wail 
Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and call'd, 
""Who spake? A dream. O light upon the wind, 
Thine, Gawain, was the voice—are these dim cries 
Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild 
Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?"" 
 
       This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake: 
""O me, my King, let pass whatever will, 
Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field; 
But in their stead thy name and glory cling 
To all high places like a golden cloud 
For ever: but as yet thou shalt not pass. 
Light was Gawain in life, and light in death 
Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man; 
And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise— 
I hear the steps of Modred in the west, 
And with him many of thy people, and knights 
Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown 
Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee. 
Right well in heart they know thee for the King. 
Arise, go forth and conquer as of old."" 
 
       Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: 
""Far other is this battle in the west 
Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth, 
And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome, 
Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall, 
And shook him thro' the north. Ill doom is mine 
To war against my people and my knights. 
The king who fights his people fights himself. 
And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke 
That strikes them dead is as my death to me. 
Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way 
Thro' this blind haze, which ever since I saw 
One lying in the dust at Almesbury, 
Hath folded in the passes of the world."" 
 
       Then rose the King and moved his host by night, 
And ever push'd Sir Modred, league by league, 
Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse— 
A land of old upheaven from the abyss 
By fire, to sink into the abyss again; 
Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt, 
And the long mountains ended in a coast 
Of ever-shifting sand, and far away 
The phantom circle of a moaning sea. 
There the pursuer could pursue no more, 
And he that fled no further fly the King; 
And there, that day when the great light of heaven 
Burn'd at his lowest in the rolling year, 
On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed. 
Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight 
Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west. 
A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea: 
Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew 
Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold 
With formless fear; and ev'n on Arthur fell 
Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought. 
 
For friend and foe were shadows in the mist, 
And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew; 
And some had visions out of golden youth, 
And some beheld the faces of old ghosts 
Look in upon the battle; and in the mist 
Was many a noble deed, many a base, 
And chance and craft and strength in single fights, 
And ever and anon with host to host 
Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn, 
Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash 
Of battleaxes on shatter'd helms, and shrieks 
After the Christ, of those who falling down 
Look'd up for heaven, and only saw the mist; 
And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights, 
Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies, 
Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs 
In that close mist, and cryings for the light, 
Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead. 
 
       Last, as by some one deathbed after wail 
Of suffering, silence follows, or thro' death 
Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore, 
Save for some whisper of the seething seas, 
A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day 
Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came 
A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew 
The mist aside, and with that wind the tide 
Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field 
Of battle: but no man was moving there; 
Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon, 
Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave 
Brake in among dead faces, to and fro 
Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down 
Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen, 
And shiver'd brands that once had fought with Rome, 
And rolling far along the gloomy shores 
The voice of days of old and days to be. 
 
       Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere, 
And whiter than the mist that all day long 
Had held the field of battle was the King: 
 
       ""Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world, 
And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move, 
And beats upon the faces of the dead, 
My dead, as tho' they had not died for me?— 
O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fall'n 
Confusion, till I know not what I am, 
Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King. 
Behold, I seem but King among the dead."" 
 
       Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere: ""My King, 
King everywhere! and so the dead have kings, 
There also will I worship thee as King. 
Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live 
Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought 
The heathen back among us, yonder stands, 
Modred, unharm'd, the traitor of thine house."" 
 
       Then spake the King: ""My house hath been my doom. 
But call not thou this traitor of my house 
Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me. 
My house are rather they who sware my vows, 
Yea, even while they brake them, own'd me King. 
And well for thee, saying in my dark hour, 
When all the purport of my throne hath fail'd, 
That quick or dead thou hottest me for King. 
King am I, whatsoever be their cry; 
And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see 
Yet, ere I pass."" And uttering this the King 
Made at the man: then Modred smote his liege 
Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword 
Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow, 
Striking the last stroke with Excalibur, 
Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell. 
 
       So all day long the noise of battle roll'd 
Among the mountains by the winter sea; 
Until King Arthur's Table, man by man, 
Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their lord, 
King Arthur. Then, because his wound was deep, 
The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him, 
And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, 
A broken chancel with a broken cross, 
That stood on a dark strait of barren land: 
On one side lay the Ocean, and on one 
Lay a great water, and the moon was full. 
 
       Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: 
""The sequel of to-day unsolders all 
The goodliest fellowship of famous knights 
Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep 
They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we 
Shall never more, at any future time, 
Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, 
Walking about the gardens and the halls 
Of Camelot, as in the days that were. 
I perish by this people which I made,— 
Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again 
To rule once more; but, let what will be, be, 
I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm 
That without help I cannot last till morn. 
Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, 
Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how 
In those old days, one summer noon, an arm 
Rose up from out the bosom of the lake, 
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, 
Holding the sword—and how I row'd across 
And took it, and have worn it, like a king; 
And, wheresoever I am sung or told 
In aftertime, this also shall be known: 
But now delay not: take Excalibur, 
And fling him far into the middle mere: 
Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."" 
 
       To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus, 
Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm— 
A little thing may harm a wounded man; 
Yet I thy hest will all perform at full, 
Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."" 
 
       So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept, 
And in the moon athwart the place of tombs, 
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, 
Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang 
Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down 
By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, 
Came on the shining levels of the lake. 
 
       There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, 
And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, 
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth 
And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: 
For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, 
Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work 
Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long 
That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood, 
This way and that dividing the swift mind, 
In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd 
Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd 
There in the many-knotted waterflags, 
That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. 
So strode he back slow to the wounded King. 
 
       Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: 
""Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? 
What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"" 
 
       And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, 
And the wild water lapping on the crag."" 
 
       To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale: 
""Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, 
Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd 
Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: 
For surer sign had follow'd, either hand 
Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. 
This is a shameful thing for men to lie. 
Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again, 
As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing 
I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."" 
 
       Then went Sir Bedivere the second time 
Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, 
Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought; 
But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, 
How curiously and strangely chased, he smote 
His palms together, and he cried aloud: 
 
       ""And if indeed I cast the brand away, 
Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, 
Should thus be lost for ever from the earth, 
Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. 
What good should follow this, if this were done? 
What harm, undone? Deep harm to disobey, 
Seeing obedience is the bond of rule. 
Were it well to obey then, if a king demand 
An act unprofitable, against himself? 
The King is sick, and knows not what he does. 
What record, or what relic of my lord 
Should be to aftertime, but empty breath 
And rumours of a doubt? But were this kept, 
Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, 
Some one might show it at a joust of arms, 
Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, 
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake. 
Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps 
Upon the hidden bases of the hills.' 
So might some old man speak in the aftertime 
To all the people, winning reverence. 
But now much honour and much fame were lost."" 
 
       So spake he, clouded with his own conceit, 
And hid Excalibur the second time, 
And so strode back slow to the wounded King. 
 
       Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: 
""What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?' 
 
       And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""I heard the water lapping on the crag, 
And the long ripple washing in the reeds."" 
 
       To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: 
""Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, 
Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! 
Authority forgets a dying king, 
Laid widow'd of the power in his eye 
That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, 
For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, 
In whom should meet the offices of all, 
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; 
Either from lust of gold, or like a girl 
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. 
Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, 
And the third time may prosper, get thee hence: 
But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, 
I will arise and slay thee with my hands."" 
 
       Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, 
And, leaping down the ridges, lightly, plunged 
Among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the sword, 
And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand 
Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, 
And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, 
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, 
Seen where the moving isles of winter shock 
By night, with noises of the Northern Sea. 
So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: 
But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm 
Clothed in white samite, mystic wonderful, 
And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him 
Three times, and drew him under in the mere. 
And lightly went the other to the King. 
 
       Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: 
""Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. 
Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"" 
 
       And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems 
Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, 
Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, 
Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, 
So great a miracle as yonder hilt. 
Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; 
But when I look'd again, behold an arm, 
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, 
That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him 
Three times, and drew him under in the mere."" 
 
       And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: 
""My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone. 
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, 
And bear me to the margin; yet I fear 
My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."" 
 
       So saying, from the pavement he half rose, 
Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, 
And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes 
As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere 
Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, 
And would have spoken, but he found not words; 
Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, 
O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, 
And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. 
 
       But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, 
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed 
When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King, 
Muttering and murmuring at his ear, ""Quick, quick! 
I fear it is too late, and I shall die."" 
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, 
Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd, 
Larger than human on the frozen hills. 
He heard the deep behind him, and a cry 
Before. His own thought drove him like a goad. 
Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves 
And barren chasms, and all to left and right 
The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based 
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang 
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— 
And on a sudden, lo! the level lake, 
And the long glories of the winter moon. 
 
       Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge, 
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, 
Beneath them; and descending they were ware 
That all the decks were dense with stately forms, 
Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream—by these 
Three Queens with crowns of gold: and from them rose 
A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, 
And, as it were one voice, an agony 
Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills 
All night in a waste land, where no one comes, 
Or hath come, since the making of the world. 
 
       Then murmur'd Arthur, ""Place me in the barge."" 
So to the barge they came. There those three Queens 
Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. 
But she, that rose the tallest of them all 
And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, 
And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, 
And call'd him by his name, complaining loud, 
And dropping bitter tears against a brow 
Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white 
And colourless, and like the wither'd moon 
Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; 
And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops 
Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls— 
That made his forehead like a rising sun 
High from the daïs-throne—were parch'd with dust 
Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, 
Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. 
So like a shatter'd column lay the King; 
Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, 
From spur to plume a star of tournament, 
Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged 
Before the eyes of ladies and of kings. 
 
       Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere: 
""Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? 
Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? 
For now I see the true old times are dead, 
When every morning brought a noble chance, 
And every chance brought out a noble knight. 
Such times have been not since the light that led 
The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. 
But now the whole Round Table is dissolved 
Which was an image of the mighty world, 
And I, the last, go forth companionless, 
And the days darken round me, and the years, 
Among new men, strange faces, other minds."" 
 
       And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: 
""The old order changeth, yielding place to new, 
And God fulfils himself in many ways, 
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. 
Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? 
I have lived my life, and that which I have done 
May He within himself make pure! but thou, 
If thou shouldst never see my face again, 
Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer 
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice 
Rise like a fountain for me night and day. 
For what are men better than sheep or goats 
That nourish a blind life within the brain, 
If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer 
Both for themselves and those who call them friend? 
For so the whole round earth is every way 
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. 
But now farewell. I am going a long way 
With these thou seëst—if indeed I go 
(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)— 
To the island-valley of Avilion; 
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, 
Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies 
Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns 
And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, 
Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."" 
 
       So said he, and the barge with oar and sail 
Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan 
That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, 
Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood 
With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere 
Revolving many memories, till the hull 
Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, 
And on the mere the wailing died away. 
 
       But when that moan had past for evermore, 
The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn 
Amazed him, and he groan'd, The King is gone.'' 
And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme, 
""From the great deep to the great deep he goes."" 
 
       Whereat he slowly turn'd and slowly clomb 
The last hard footstep of that iron crag; 
Thence mark'd the black hull moving yet, and cried, 
""He passes to be King among the dead, 
And after healing of his grievous wound 
He comes again; but—if he come no more— 
O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat, 
Who shriek'd and wail'd, the three whereat we gazed 
On that high day, when, clothed with living light, 
They stood before his throne in silence, friends 
Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?"" 
 
       Then from the dawn it seem'd there came, but faint 
As from beyond the limit of the world, 
Like the last echo born of a great cry, 
Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice 
Around a king returning from his wars. 
 
       Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb 
Ev'n to the highest he could climb, and saw, 
Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand, 
Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King, 
Down that long water opening on the deep 
Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go 
From less to less and vanish into light. 
And the new sun rose bringing the new year.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Fairy-tales & Legends', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45325/idylls-of-the-king-the-passing-of-arthur,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,from Idylls of the King: The Last Tournament,"Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood 
Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round, 
At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods, 
Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall. 
And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand, 
And from the crown thereof a carcanet 
Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize 
Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday, 
Came Tristram, saying, ""Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"" 
 
       For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once 
Far down beneath a winding wall of rock 
Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead. 
From roots like some black coil of carven snakes, 
Clutch'd at the crag, and started thro' mid air 
Bearing an eagle's nest: and thro' the tree 
Rush'd ever a rainy wind, and thro' the wind 
Pierced ever a child's cry: and crag and tree 
Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest, 
This ruby necklace thrice around her neck, 
And all unscarr'd from beak or talon, brought 
A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took, 
Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the Queen 
But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms 
Received, and after loved it tenderly, 
And named it Nestling; so forgot herself 
A moment, and her cares; till that young life 
Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold 
Past from her; and in time the carcanet 
Vext her with plaintive memories of the child: 
So she, delivering it to Arthur, said, 
""Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence, 
And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize."" 
 
       To whom the King, ""Peace to thine eagle-borne 
Dead nestling, and this honour after death, 
Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse 
Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone 
Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn, 
And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear."" 
 
       ""Would rather you had let them fall,"" she cried, 
""Plunge and be lost—ill-fated as they were, 
A bitterness to me!—ye look amazed, 
Not knowing they were lost as soon as given— 
Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out 
Above the river—that unhappy child 
Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go 
With these rich jewels, seeing that they came 
Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer, 
But the sweet body of a maiden babe. 
Perchance—who knows?—the purest of thy knights 
May win them for the purest of my maids."" 
 
       She ended, and the cry of a great jousts 
With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways 
From Camelot in among the faded fields 
To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights 
Arm'd for a day of glory before the King. 
 
       But on the hither side of that loud morn 
Into the hall stagger'd, his visage ribb'd 
From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose 
Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off, 
And one with shatter'd fingers dangling lame, 
A churl, to whom indignantly the King, 
 
       ""My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast 
Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend? 
Man was it who marr'd heaven's image in thee thus?"" 
 
       Then, sputtering thro' the hedge of splinter'd teeth, 
Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump 
Pitch-blacken'd sawing the air, said the maim'd churl, 
 
       ""He took them and he drave them to his tower— 
Some hold he was a table-knight of thine— 
A hundred goodly ones—the Red Knight, he— 
Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight 
Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower; 
And when I call'd upon thy name as one 
That doest right by gentle and by churl, 
Maim'd me and maul'd, and would outright have slain, 
Save that he sware me to a message, saying, 
'Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I 
Have founded my Round Table in the North, 
And whatsoever his own knights have sworn 
My knights have sworn the counter to it—and say 
My tower is full of harlots, like his court, 
But mine are worthier, seeing they profess 
To be none other than themselves—and say 
My knights are all adulterers like his own, 
But mine are truer, seeing they profess 
To be none other; and say his hour is come, 
The heathen are upon him, his long lance 
Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.' "" 
 
       Then Arthur turn'd to Kay the seneschal, 
""Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously 
Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole. 
The heathen—but that ever-climbing wave, 
Hurl'd back again so often in empty foam, 
Hath lain for years at rest—and renegades, 
Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom 
The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere, 
Friends, thro' your manhood and your fealty,—now 
Make their last head like Satan in the North. 
My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower 
Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds, 
Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved, 
The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore. 
But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place 
Enchair'd to-morrow, arbitrate the field; 
For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it 
Only to yield my Queen her own again? 
Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?"" 
 
       Thereto Sir Lancelot answer'd, ""It is well: 
Yet better if the King abide, and leave 
The leading of his younger knights to me. 
Else, for the King has will'd it, it is well."" 
 
       Then Arthur rose and Lancelot follow'd him, 
And while they stood without the doors, the King 
Turn'd to him saying, ""Is it then so well? 
Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he 
Of whom was written, 'A sound is in his ears'? 
The foot that loiters, bidden go,—the glance 
That only seems half-loyal to command,— 
A manner somewhat fall'n from reverence— 
Or have I dream'd the bearing of our knights 
Tells of a manhood ever less and lower? 
Or whence the fear lest this my realm, uprear'd, 
By noble deeds at one with noble vows, 
From flat confusion and brute violences, 
Reel back into the beast, and be no more?"" 
 
       He spoke, and taking all his younger knights, 
Down the slope city rode, and sharply turn'd 
North by the gate. In her high bower the Queen, 
Working a tapestry, lifted up her head, 
Watch'd her lord pass, and knew not that she sigh'd. 
Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme 
Of bygone Merlin, ""Where is he who knows? 
From the great deep to the great deep he goes."" 
 
       But when the morning of a tournament, 
By these in earnest those in mockery call'd 
The Tournament of the Dead Innocence, 
Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot, 
Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey, 
The words of Arthur flying shriek'd, arose, 
And down a streetway hung with folds of pure 
White samite, and by fountains running wine, 
Where children sat in white with cups of gold, 
Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps 
Ascending, fill'd his double-dragon'd chair. 
 
       He glanced and saw the stately galleries, 
Dame, damsel, each thro' worship of their Queen 
White-robed in honour of the stainless child, 
And some with scatter'd jewels, like a bank 
Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire. 
He look'd but once, and vail'd his eyes again. 
 
       The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream 
To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll 
Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began: 
And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf 
And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume 
Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one 
Who sits and gazes on a faded fire, 
When all the goodlier guests are past away, 
Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists. 
He saw the laws that ruled the tournament 
Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down 
Before his throne of arbitration cursed 
The dead babe and the follies of the King; 
And once the laces of a helmet crack'd, 
And show'd him, like a vermin in its hole, 
Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard 
The voice that billow'd round the barriers roar 
An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight, 
But newly-enter'd, taller than the rest, 
And armour'd all in forest green, whereon 
There tript a hundred tiny silver deer, 
And wearing but a holly-spray for crest, 
With ever-scattering berries, and on shield 
A spear, a harp, a bugle—Tristram—late 
From overseas in Brittany return'd, 
And marriage with a princess of that realm, 
Isolt the White—Sir Tristram of the Woods— 
Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain 
His own against him, and now yearn'd to shake 
The burthen off his heart in one full shock 
With Tristram ev'n to death: his strong hands gript 
And dinted the gilt dragons right and left, 
Until he groan'd for wrath—so many of those, 
That ware their ladies' colours on the casque, 
Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds, 
And there with gibes and flickering mockeries 
Stood, while he mutter'd, ""Craven crests! O shame! 
What faith have these in whom they sware to love? 
The glory of our Round Table is no more."" 
 
       So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems, 
Not speaking other word than ""Hast thou won? 
Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand 
Wherewith thou takest this, is red!"" to whom 
Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood, 
Made answer, ""Ay, but wherefore toss me this 
Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound? 
Let be thy fair Queen's fantasy. Strength of heart 
And might of limb, but mainly use and skill, 
Are winners in this pastime of our King. 
My hand—belike the lance hath dript upon it— 
No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight, 
Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield, 
Great brother, thou nor I have made the world; 
Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine."" 
 
       And Tristram round the gallery made his horse 
Caracole; then bow'd his homage, bluntly saying, 
""Fair damsels, each to him who worships each 
Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold 
This day my Queen of Beauty is not here."" 
And most of these were mute, some anger'd, one 
Murmuring, ""All courtesy is dead,"" and one, 
""The glory of our Round Table is no more."" 
 
       Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung, 
And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day 
Went glooming down in wet and weariness: 
But under her black brows a swarthy one 
Laugh'd shrilly, crying, ""Praise the patient saints, 
Our one white day of Innocence hath past, 
Tho' somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it. 
The snowdrop only, flowering thro' the year, 
Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide. 
Come—let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen's 
And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity 
With all the kindlier colours of the field."" 
 
       So dame and damsel glitter'd at the feast 
Variously gay: for he that tells the tale 
Liken'd them, saying, as when an hour of cold 
Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows, 
And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers 
Pass under white, till the warm hour returns 
With veer of wind, and all are flowers again; 
So dame and damsel cast the simple white, 
And glowing in all colours, the live grass, 
Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced 
About the revels, and with mirth so loud 
Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen, 
And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts, 
Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower 
Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord. 
 
       And little Dagonet on the morrow morn, 
High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide, 
Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall. 
Then Tristram saying, ""Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"" 
Wheel'd round on either heel, Dagonet replied, 
""Belike for lack of wiser company; 
Or being fool, and seeing too much wit 
Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip 
To know myself the wisest knight of all."" 
""Ay, fool,"" said Tristram, ""but 'tis eating dry 
To dance without a catch, a roundelay 
To dance to."" Then he twangled on his harp, 
And while he twangled little Dagonet stood 
Quiet as any water-sodden log 
Stay'd in the wandering warble of a brook; 
But when the twangling ended, skipt again; 
And being ask'd, ""Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?"" 
Made answer, ""I had liefer twenty years 
Skip to the broken music of my brains 
Than any broken music thou canst make."" 
Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come, 
""Good now, what music have I broken, fool?"" 
And little Dagonet, skipping, ""Arthur, the King's; 
For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt, 
Thou makest broken music with thy bride, 
Her daintier namesake down in Brittany— 
And so thou breakest Arthur's music, too."" 
""Save for that broken music in thy brains, 
Sir Fool,"" said Tristram, ""I would break thy head. 
Fool, I came late, the heathen wars were o'er, 
The life had flown, we sware but by the shell— 
I am but a fool to reason with a fool— 
Come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me down, 
Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears, 
And harken if my music be not true. 
 
       ""'Free love—free field—we love but while we may: 
The woods are hush'd, their music is no more: 
The leaf is dead, the yearning past away: 
New leaf, new life—the days of frost are o'er: 
New life, new love, to suit the newer day: 
New loves are sweet as those that went before: 
Free love—free field—we love but while we may.' 
 
       ""Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune, 
Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods, 
And heard it ring as true as tested gold."" 
 
       But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand, 
""Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday 
Made to run wine?—but this had run itself 
All out like a long life to a sour end— 
And them that round it sat with golden cups 
To hand the wine to whosoever came— 
The twelve small damosels white as Innocence, 
In honour of poor Innocence the babe, 
Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen 
Lent to the King, and Innocence the King 
Gave for a prize—and one of those white slips 
Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one, 
'Drink, drink, Sir Fool,' and thereupon I drank, 
Spat—pish—the cup was gold, the draught was mud."" 
 
       And Tristram, ""Was it muddier than thy gibes? 
Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?— 
Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool— 
'Fear God: honour the King—his one true knight— 
Sole follower of the vows'—for here be they 
Who knew thee swine enow before I came, 
Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King 
Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up 
It frighted all free fool from out thy heart; 
Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine, 
A naked aught—yet swine I hold thee still, 
For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine."" 
 
       And little Dagonet mincing with his feet, 
""Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck 
In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch 
Of music, since I care not for thy pearls. 
Swine? I have wallow'd, I have wash'd—the world 
Is flesh and shadow—I have had my day. 
The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind 
Hath foul'd me—an I wallow'd, then I wash'd— 
I have had my day and my philosophies— 
And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool. 
Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese 
Troop'd round a Paynim harper once, who thrumm'd 
On such a wire as musically as thou 
Some such fine song—but never a king's fool."" 
 
       And Tristram, ""Then were swine, goats, asses, geese 
The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard 
Had such a mastery of his mystery 
That he could harp his wife up out of hell."" 
 
       Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot, 
""And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself 
Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou, 
That harpest downward! Dost thou know the star 
We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?"" 
 
       And Tristram, ""Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King 
Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights, 
Glorying in each new glory, set his name 
High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven."" 
 
       And Dagonet answer'd, ""Ay, and when the land 
Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself 
To babble about him, all to show your wit— 
And whether he were King by courtesy, 
Or King by right—and so went harping down 
The black king's highway, got so far, and grew 
So witty that we play'd at ducks and drakes 
With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire. 
Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?"" 
 
       ""Nay, fool,"" said Tristram, ""not in open day."" 
And Dagonet, ""Nay, nor will: I see it and hear. 
It makes a silent music up in heaven, 
And I, and Arthur and the angels hear, 
And then we skip."" ""Lo, fool,"" he said, ""ye talk 
Fool's treason: is the King thy brother fool?"" 
Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrill'd, 
""Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools! 
Conceits himself as God that he can make 
Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk 
From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs, 
And men from beasts—Long live the king of fools!"" 
 
       And down the city Dagonet danced away; 
But thro' the slowly-mellowing avenues 
And solitary passes of the wood 
Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west. 
Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt 
With ruby-circled neck, but evermore 
Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood 
Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye 
For all that walk'd, or crept, or perch'd, or flew. 
Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown, 
Unruffling waters re-collect the shape 
Of one that in them sees himself, return'd; 
But at the slot or fewmets of a deer, 
Or ev'n a fall'n feather, vanish'd again. 
 
       So on for all that day from lawn to lawn 
Thro' many a league-long bower he rode. At length 
A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs 
Furze-cramm'd, and bracken-rooft, the which himself 
Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt 
Against a shower, dark in the golden grove 
Appearing, sent his fancy back to where 
She lived a moon in that low lodge with him: 
Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King, 
With six or seven, when Tristram was away, 
And snatch'd her thence; yet dreading worse than shame 
Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word, 
But bode his hour, devising wretchedness. 
 
       And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt 
So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank 
Down on a drift of foliage random-blown; 
But could not rest for musing how to smoothe 
And sleek his marriage over to the Queen. 
Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all 
The tonguesters of the court she had not heard. 
But then what folly had sent him overseas 
After she left him lonely here? a name? 
Was it the name of one in Brittany, 
Isolt, the daughter of the King? ""Isolt 
Of the white hands"" they call'd her: the sweet name 
Allured him first, and then the maid herself, 
Who served him well with those white hands of hers, 
And loved him well, until himself had thought 
He loved her also, wedded easily, 
But left her all as easily, and return'd. 
The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes 
Had drawn him home—what marvel? then he laid 
His brows upon the drifted leaf and dream'd. 
 
       He seem'd to pace the strand of Brittany 
Between Isolt of Britain and his bride, 
And show'd them both the ruby-chain, and both 
Began to struggle for it, till his Queen 
Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red. 
Then cried the Breton, ""Look, her hand is red! 
These be no rubies, this is frozen blood, 
And melts within her hand—her hand is hot 
With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look, 
Is all as cool and white as any flower."" 
Follow'd a rush of eagle's wings, and then 
A whimpering of the spirit of the child, 
Because the twain had spoil'd her carcanet. 
 
       He dream'd; but Arthur with a hundred spears 
Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed, 
And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle, 
The wide-wing'd sunset of the misty marsh 
Glared on a huge machicolated tower 
That stood with open doors, whereout was roll'd 
A roar of riot, as from men secure 
Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease 
Among their harlot-brides, an evil song. 
""Lo there,"" said one of Arthur's youth, for there, 
High on a grim dead tree before the tower, 
A goodly brother of the Table Round 
Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield 
Showing a shower of blood in a field noir, 
And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights 
At that dishonour done the gilded spur, 
Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn. 
But Arthur waved them back. Alone he rode. 
Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn, 
That sent the face of all the marsh aloft 
An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud 
Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all, 
Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm, 
In blood-red armour sallying, howl'd to the King, 
 
       ""The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!— 
Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King 
Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world— 
The woman-worshipper? Yea, God's curse, and I! 
Slain was the brother of my paramour 
By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine 
And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too, 
Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell, 
And stings itself to everlasting death, 
To hang whatever knight of thine I fought 
And tumbled. Art thou King?—Look to thy life!"" 
 
       He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face 
Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name 
Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind. 
And Arthur deign'd not use of word or sword, 
But let the drunkard, as he stretch'd from horse 
To strike him, overbalancing his bulk, 
Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp 
Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave, 
Heard in dead night along that table-shore, 
Drops flat, and after the great waters break 
Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves, 
Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud, 
From less and less to nothing; thus he fell 
Head-heavy; then the knights, who watch'd him, roar'd 
And shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n; 
There trampled out his face from being known, 
And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves: 
Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang 
Thro' open doors, and swording right and left 
Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurl'd 
The tables over and the wines, and slew 
Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells, 
And all the pavement stream'd with massacre: 
Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower, 
Which half that autumn night, like the live North, 
Red-pulsing up thro' Alioth and Alcor, 
Made all above it, and a hundred meres 
About it, as the water Moab saw 
Come round by the East, and out beyond them flush'd 
The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea. 
 
       So all the ways were safe from shore to shore, 
But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord. 
 
       Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream 
Fled with a shout, and that low lodge return'd, 
Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs. 
He whistled his good warhorse left to graze 
Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him, 
And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf, 
Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross, 
Stay'd him. ""Why weep ye?"" ""Lord,"" she said, ""my man 
Hath left me or is dead""; whereon he thought— 
""What, if she hate me now? I would not this. 
What, if she love me still? I would not that. 
I know not what I would""—but said to her, 
""Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return, 
He find thy favour changed and love thee not""— 
Then pressing day by day thro' Lyonnesse 
Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard 
The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds 
Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gain'd 
Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land, 
A crown of towers. 
 
                        Down in a casement sat, 
A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair 
And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen. 
And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind 
The spiring stone that scaled about her tower, 
Flush'd, started, met him at the doors, and there 
Belted his body with her white embrace, 
Crying aloud, ""Not Mark—not Mark, my soul! 
The footstep flutter'd me at first: not he: 
Catlike thro' his own castle steals my Mark, 
But warrior-wise thou stridest thro' his halls 
Who hates thee, as I him—ev'n to the death. 
My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark 
Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh."" 
To whom Sir Tristram smiling, ""I am here. 
Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine."" 
 
       And drawing somewhat backward she replied, 
""Can he be wrong'd who is not ev'n his own, 
But save for dread of thee had beaten me, 
Scratch'd, bitten, blinded, marr'd me somehow—Mark? 
What rights are his that dare not strike for them? 
Not lift a hand—not, tho' he found me thus! 
But harken! have ye met him? hence he went 
To-day for three days' hunting—as he said— 
And so returns belike within an hour. 
Mark's way, my soul!—but eat not thou with Mark, 
Because he hates thee even more than fears; 
Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood 
Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush 
Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell. 
My God, the measure of my hate for Mark 
Is as the measure of my love for thee.'' 
 
       So, pluck'd one way by hate and one by love, 
Drain'd of her force, again she sat, and spake 
To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying, 
""O hunter, and O blower of the horn, 
Harper, and thou hast been a rover too, 
For, ere I mated with my shambling king, 
Ye twain had fallen out about the bride 
Of one—his name is out of me—the prize, 
If prize she were—(what marvel—she could see)— 
Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks 
To wreck thee villainously: but, O Sir Knight, 
What dame or damsel have ye kneel'd to last?"" 
 
       And Tristram, ""Last to my Queen Paramount, 
Here now to my Queen Paramount of love 
And loveliness—ay, lovelier than when first 
Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse, 
Sailing from Ireland."" 
 
                                 Softly laugh'd Isolt; 
""Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen 
My dole of beauty trebled?"" and he said, 
""Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine, 
And thine is more to me—soft, gracious, kind— 
Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips 
Most gracious; but she, haughty ev'n to him, 
Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow 
To make one doubt if ever the great Queen 
Have yielded him her love."" 
 
                                          To whom Isolt, 
""Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou 
Who brakest thro' the scruple of my bond, 
Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me 
That Guinevere had sinn'd against the highest, 
And I—misyoked with such a want of man— 
That I could hardly sin against the lowest."" 
 
       He answer'd, ""O my soul, be comforted! 
If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings, 
If here be comfort, and if ours be sin, 
Crown'd warrant had we for the crowning sin 
That made us happy: but how ye greet me—fear 
And fault and doubt—no word of that fond tale— 
Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories 
Of Tristram in that year he was away."" 
 
       And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt, 
""I had forgotten all in my strong joy 
To see thee—yearnings?—ay! for, hour by hour, 
Here in the never-ended afternoon, 
O sweeter than all memories of thee, 
Deeper than any yearnings after thee 
Seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas, 
Watch'd from this tower. Isolt of Britain dash'd 
Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand, 
Would that have chill'd her bride-kiss? Wedded her? 
Fought in her father's battles? wounded there? 
The King was all fulfill'd with gratefulness, 
And she, my namesake of the hands, that heal'd 
Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress— 
Well—can I wish her any huger wrong 
Than having known thee? her too hast thou left 
To pine and waste in those sweet memories. 
O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men 
Are noble, I should hate thee more than love."" 
 
       And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied, 
""Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me well. 
Did I love her? the name at least I loved. 
Isolt?—I fought his battles, for Isolt! 
The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt! 
The name was ruler of the dark—Isolt? 
Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek, 
Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God."" 
 
       And Isolt answer'd, ""Yea, and why not I? 
Mine is the larger need, who am not meek, 
Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now. 
Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat, 
Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where, 
Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing, 
And once or twice I spake thy name aloud. 
Then flash'd a levin-brand; and near me stood, 
In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend— 
Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark— 
For there was Mark: 'He has wedded her,' he said, 
Not said, but hiss'd it: then this crown of towers 
So shook to such a roar of all the sky, 
That here in utter dark I swoon'd away, 
And woke again in utter dark, and cried, 
'I will flee hence and give myself to God'— 
And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms."" 
 
       Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand, 
""May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray, 
And past desire!"" a saying that anger'd her. 
""'May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old, 
And sweet no more to me!' I need Him now. 
For when had Lancelot utter'd aught so gross 
Ev'n to the swineherd's malkin in the mast? 
The greater man, the greater courtesy. 
Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight! 
But thou, thro' ever harrying thy wild beasts— 
Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance 
Becomes thee well—art grown wild beast thyself. 
How darest thou, if lover, push me even 
In fancy from thy side, and set me far 
In the gray distance, half a life away, 
Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear! 
Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak, 
Broken with Mark and hate and solitude, 
Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck 
Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe. 
Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel, 
And solemnly as when ye sware to him, 
The man of men, our King—My God, the power 
Was once in vows when men believed the King! 
They lied not then, who sware, and thro' their vows 
The King prevailing made his realm:—I say, 
Swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old, 
Gray-hair'd, and past desire, and in despair."" 
 
       Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down, 
""Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark 
More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt, 
The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself— 
My knighthood taught me this—ay, being snapt— 
We run more counter to the soul thereof 
Than had we never sworn. I swear no more. 
I swore to the great King, and am forsworn. 
For once—ev'n to the height—I honour'd him. 
'Man, is he man at all?' methought, when first 
I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld 
That victor of the Pagan throned in hall— 
His hair, a sun that ray'd from off a brow 
Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes, 
The golden beard that clothed his lips with light— 
Moreover, that weird legend of his birth, 
With Merlin's mystic babble about his end 
Amazed me; then his foot was on a stool 
Shaped as a dragon; he seem'd to me no man, 
But Michaël trampling Satan; so I sware, 
Being amazed: but this went by—The vows! 
O ay—the wholesome madness of an hour— 
They served their use, their time; for every knight 
Believed himself a greater than himself, 
And every follower eyed him as a God; 
Till he, being lifted up beyond himself, 
Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done, 
And so the realm was made; but then their vows— 
First mainly thro' that sullying of our Queen— 
Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence 
Had Arthur right to bind them to himself? 
Dropt down from heaven? wash'd up from out the deep? 
They fail'd to trace him thro' the flesh and blood 
Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord 
To bind them by inviolable vows, 
Which flesh and blood perforce would violate: 
For feel this arm of mine—the tide within 
Red with free chase and heather-scented air, 
Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure 
As any maiden child? lock up my tongue 
From uttering freely what I freely hear? 
Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at it. 
And worldling of the world am I, and know 
The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour 
Woos his own end; we are not angels here 
Nor shall be: vows—I am woodman of the woods, 
And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale 
Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may; 
And therefore is my love so large for thee, 
Seeing it is not bounded save by love."" 
 
       Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said, 
""Good: an I turn'd away my love for thee 
To some one thrice as courteous as thyself— 
For courtesy wins woman all as well 
As valour may, but he that closes both 
Is perfect, he is Lancelot—taller indeed, 
Rosier and comelier, thou—but say I loved 
This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back 
Thine own small saw, 'We love but while we may,' 
Well then, what answer?"" 
 
                                     He that while she spake, 
Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with, 
The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch 
The warm white apple of her throat, replied, 
""Press this a little closer, sweet, until— 
Come, I am hunger'd and half-anger'd—meat, 
Wine, wine—and I will love thee to the death, 
And out beyond into the dream to come."" 
 
       So then, when both were brought to full accord, 
She rose, and set before him all he will'd; 
And after these had comforted the blood 
With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts— 
Now talking of their woodland paradise, 
The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns; 
Now mocking at the much ungainliness, 
And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark— 
Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang: 
 
       ""Ay, ay, O ay—the winds that bend the brier! 
A star in heaven, a star within the mere! 
Ay, ay, O ay—a star was my desire, 
And one was far apart, and one was near: 
Ay, ay, O ay—the winds that bow the grass! 
And one was water and one star was fire, 
And one will ever shine and one will pass. 
Ay, ay, O ay—the winds that move the mere."" 
 
       Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram show'd 
And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried, 
""The collar of some Order, which our King 
Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul, 
For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers."" 
 
       ""Not so, my Queen,"" he said, ""but the red fruit 
Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven, 
And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize, 
And hither brought by Tristram for his last 
Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee."" 
 
       He spoke, he turn'd, then, flinging round her neck, 
Claspt it, and cried ""Thine Order, O my Queen!"" 
But, while he bow'd to kiss the jewell'd throat, 
Out of the dark, just as the lips had touch'd, 
Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek— 
""Mark's way,"" said Mark, and clove him thro' the brain. 
 
       That night came Arthur home, and while he climb'd, 
All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom, 
The stairway to the hall, and look'd and saw 
The great Queen's bower was dark,—about his feet 
A voice clung sobbing till he question'd it, 
""What art thou?"" and the voice about his feet 
Sent up an answer, sobbing, ""I am thy fool, 
And I shall never make thee smile again.""",blank verse,meters,"['Love', 'Desire', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Fairy-tales & Legends', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Blank Verse', 'Epic']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45324/idylls-of-the-king-the-last-tournament,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",1809–1892,To J. S.,"The wind, that beats the mountain, blows
   More softly round the open wold,
And gently comes the world to those
   That are cast in gentle mould.

And me this knowledge bolder made,
   Or else I had not dare to flow
In these words toward you, and invade
   Even with a verse your holy woe.

'Tis strange that those we lean on most,
   Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,
Fall into shadow, soonest lost:
   Those we love first are taken first.

God gives us love. Something to love
   He lends us; but, when love is grown
To ripeness, that on which it throve
   Falls off, and love is left alone.

This is the curse of time. Alas!
   In grief I am not all unlearn'd;
Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass;
   One went, who never hath return'd.

He will not smile—not speak to me
   Once more. Two years his chair is seen
Empty before us. That was he
   Without whose life I had not been.

Your loss is rarer; for this star
   Rose with you thro' a little arc
Of heaven, nor having wander'd far
   Shot on the sudden into dark.

I knew your brother: his mute dust
   I honour and his living worth:
A man more pure and bold and just
   Was never born into the earth.

I have not look'd upon you nigh,
   Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.
Great nature is more wise than I:
   I will not tell you not to weep.

And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,
   Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain,
I will not even preach to you,
   ""Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain.""

Let Grief be her own mistress still.
   She loveth her own anguish deep
More than much pleasure. Let her will
   Be done—to weep or not to weep.

I will not say ""God's ordinance
   Of death is blown in every wind;""
For that is not a common chance
   That takes away a noble mind.

His memory long will live alone
   In all our hearts, as mournful light
That broods above the fallen sun,
   And dwells in heaven half the night.

Vain solace! Memory standing near
   Cast down her eyes, and in her throat
Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear
   Dropt on the letters as I wrote.

I wrote I know not what. In truth,
   How should I soothe you anyway,
Who miss the brother of your youth?
   Yet something I did wish to say:

For he too was a friend to me:
   Both are my friends, and my true breast
Bleedeth for both: yet it may be
   That only silence suiteth best.

Words weaker than your grief would make
   Grief more. 'Twere better I should cease;
Although myself could almost take
   The place of him that sleeps in peace.

Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace;
   Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,
While the stars burn, the moons increase,
   And the great ages onward roll.

Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet.
   Nothing comes to thee new or strange,
Sleep full of rest from head to feet:
   Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.",common measure,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Time & Brevity', 'Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45390/to-j-s,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson,,1809.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.,1809–1894,The Chambered Nautilus,"This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
 Sails the unshadowed main,—
 The venturous bark that flings
On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
 And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.

Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
 Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
 And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
 Before thee lies revealed,—
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!

Year after year beheld the silent toil
 That spread his lustrous coil;
 Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year’s dwelling for the new,
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
 Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.

Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
 Child of the wandering sea,
 Cast from her lap, forlorn!
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
Than ever Triton blew from wreathèd horn!
 While on mine ear it rings,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
 As the swift seasons roll!
 Leave thy low-vaulted past!
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
 Till thou at length art free,

Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.,1809–1894,The Living Temple,"Not in the world of light alone,
Where God has built his blazing throne,
Nor yet alone in earth below,
With belted seas that come and go,
And endless isles of sunlit green,
Is all thy Maker’s glory seen:
Look in upon thy wondrous frame,—
Eternal wisdom still the same!

The smooth, soft air with pulse-like waves
Flows murmuring through its hidden caves,
Whose streams of brightening purple rush,
Fired with a new and livelier blush,
While all their burden of decay
The ebbing current steals away,
And red with Nature’s flame they start
From the warm fountains of the heart.

No rest that throbbing slave may ask,
Forever quivering o’er his task,
While far and wide a crimson jet
Leaps forth to fill the woven net
Which in unnumbered crossing tides
The flood of burning life divides,
Then, kindling each decaying part,
Creeps back to find the throbbing heart.

But warmed with that unchanging flame
Behold the outward moving frame,
Its living marbles jointed strong
With glistening band and silvery thong,
And linked to reason’s guiding reins
By myriad rings in trembling chains,
Each graven with the threaded zone
Which claims it as the master’s own.

See how yon beam of seeming white
Is braided out of seven-hued light,
Yet in those lucid globes no ray
By any chance shall break astray.
Hark how the rolling surge of sound,
Arches and spirals circling round,
Wakes the hushed spirit through thine ear
With music it is heaven to hear.

Then mark the cloven sphere that holds
All thought in its mysterious folds;
That feels sensation’s faintest thrill,
And flashes forth the sovereign will;
Think on the stormy world that dwells
Locked in its dim and clustering cells!
The lightning gleams of power it sheds
Along its hollow glassy threads!

O Father! grant thy love divine
To make these mystic temples thine!

Have sapped the leaning walls of life,
When darkness gathers over all,

   Water your damned flower-pots, do!
If hate killed men, Brother Lawrence,
   God's blood, would not mine kill you!
What? your myrtle-bush wants trimming? 
   Oh, that rose has prior claims--
Needs its leaden vase filled brimming?
   Hell dry you up with its flames!

At the meal we sit together;
   Salve tibi! I must hear
Wise talk of the kind of weather,
   Sort of season, time of year:
Not a plenteous cork crop: scarcely
   Dare we hope oak-galls, I doubt;
What's the Latin name for ""parsley""?
What's the Greek name for ""swine's snout""?

Whew! We'll have our platter burnished,
   Laid with care on our own shelf!
With a fire-new spoon we're furnished,
   And a goblet for ourself,
Rinsed like something sacrificial
   Ere 'tis fit to touch our chaps--
Marked with L. for our initial!
   (He-he! There his lily snaps!)

Saint, forsooth! While Brown Dolores
   Squats outside the Convent bank
With Sanchicha, telling stories,
   Steeping tresses in the tank,
Blue-black, lustrous, thick like horsehairs,
   --Can't I see his dead eye glow, 
Bright as 'twere a Barbary corsair's?
   (That is, if he'd let it show!)

When he finishes refection,
   Knife and fork he never lays
Cross-wise, to my recollection,
   As do I, in Jesu's praise.
I the Trinity illustrate,
   Drinking watered orange pulp--
In three sips the Arian frustrate;
   While he drains his at one gulp!

Oh, those melons! if he's able
   We're to have a feast; so nice!
One goes to the Abbot's table,
   All of us get each a slice.
How go on your flowers? None double?
   Not one fruit-sort can you spy?
Strange!--And I, too, at such trouble,
   Keep them close-nipped on the sly!

There's a great text in Galatians,
   Once you trip on it, entails
Twenty-nine district damnations,
   One sure, if another fails;
If I trip him just a-dying,
   Sure of heaven as sure can be,
Spin him round and send him flying
   Off to hell, a Manichee?

Or, my scrofulous French novel
   On grey paper with blunt type!
Simply glance at it, you grovel
   Hand and foot in Belial's gripe;
If I double down its pages
   At the woeful sixteenth print,
When he gathers his greengages,
   Ope a sieve and slip it in't?

Or, there's Satan!--one might venture
   Pledge one's soul to him, yet leave
Such a flaw in the indenture
   As he'd miss till, past retrieve,
Blasted lay that rose-acacia
   We're so proud of! Hy, Zy, Hine...

The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by

And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 't was not

Over my lady's wrist too much,' or 'Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat:' such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
Sir, 't was all one! My favour at her breast,
The dropping of the daylight in the West,
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
She rode with round the terrace—all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
Or blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked
Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
In speech—(which I have not)—to make your will
Quite clear to such an one, and say, 'Just this
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
Or there exceed the mark'—and if she let
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,
—E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
As if alive. Will 't please you rise? We'll meet
The company below then. I repeat,
The Count your master's known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretence
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed
At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,

Charles Dickens,1812–1870,The Song of the Wreck,"The wind blew high, the waters raved,
   A ship drove on the land,
A hundred human creatures saved
   Kneel’d down upon the sand.
Three-score were drown’d, three-score were thrown
   Upon the black rocks wild,
And thus among them, left alone,
   They found one helpless child.

A seaman rough, to shipwreck bred,
   Stood out from all the rest,
And gently laid the lonely head
   Upon his honest breast.
And travelling o’er the desert wide
   It was a solemn joy,
To see them, ever side by side,
   The sailor and the boy.

In famine, sickness, hunger, thirst,
   The two were still but one,
Until the strong man droop’d the first
   And felt his labours done.
Then to a trusty friend he spake,
   “Across the desert wide,
O take this poor boy for my sake!”
   And kiss’d the child and died.

Toiling along in weary plight
   Through heavy jungle, mire,
These two came later every night
   To warm them at the fire.
Until the captain said one day,
   “O seaman good and kind,
To save thyself now come away,
   And leave the boy behind!”

The child was slumbering near the blaze:
   “O captain, let him rest
Until it sinks, when God’s own ways
   Shall teach us what is best!”
They watch’d the whiten’d ashy heap,
   They touch’d the child in vain;
They did not leave him there asleep,
   He never woke again.",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Parenthood', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Religion', 'God & the Divine', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45862/the-song-of-the-wreck,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/charles-dickens,,1812.0,1870.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea 
   In a beautiful pea-green boat, 
They took some honey, and plenty of money, 
   Wrapped up in a five-pound note. 
The Owl looked up to the stars above,

They sailed away, for a year and a day,

And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood 
   With a ring at the end of his nose, 
             His nose, 
             His nose, 
   With a ring at the end of his nose. 
 
III 
""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling 
   Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will."" 
So they took it away, and were married next day 
   By the Turkey who lives on the hill. 
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,

   ""Now that I come to die,
Do I view the world as a vale of tears?""
   Ah, reverend sir, not I!

 What I viewed there once, what I view again
   Where the physic bottles stand
On the table's edge,—is a suburb lane,
   With a wall to my bedside hand.

 That lane sloped, much as the bottles do,
   From a house you could descry
O'er the garden-wall; is the curtain blue
   Or green to a healthy eye?

 To mine, it serves for the old June weather
   Blue above lane and wall;
And that farthest bottle labelled ""Ether""
   Is the house o'ertopping all.

 At a terrace, somewhere near the stopper,
   There watched for me, one June,
A girl: I know, sir, it's improper,
   My poor mind's out of tune.

 Only, there was a way... you crept
   Close by the side, to dodge
Eyes in the house, two eyes except:
   They styled their house ""The Lodge.""

 What right had a lounger up their lane?
   But, by creeping very close,
With the good wall's help,—their eyes might strain
   And stretch themselves to Oes,

 Yet never catch her and me together,
   As she left the attic, there,
By the rim of the bottle labelled ""Ether,""
   And stole from stair to stair,

 And stood by the rose-wreathed gate. Alas,

The power of the night, the press of the storm,
The post of the foe;
Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,

For the journey is done and the summit attained,
And the barriers fall,
Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,
The reward of it all.
I was ever a fighter, so—one fight more,
The best and the last!
I would hate that death bandaged my eyes and forbore,
And bade me creep past.
No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers
The heroes of old,
Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears
Of pain, darkness and cold.
For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,
The black minute's at end,
And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,

Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Youth and Art,"It once might have been, once only:
   We lodged in a street together,
You, a sparrow on the housetop lonely,
   I, a lone she-bird of his feather.

 Your trade was with sticks and clay,
   You thumbed, thrust, patted and polished,
Then laughed ""They will see some day
   Smith made, and Gibson demolished.""

 My business was song, song, song;
   I chirped, cheeped, trilled and twittered,
""Kate Brown's on the boards ere long,
   And Grisi's existence embittered!""

 I earned no more by a warble
   Than you by a sketch in plaster;
You wanted a piece of marble,
   I needed a music-master.

 We studied hard in our styles,
   Chipped each at a crust like Hindoos,
For air looked out on the tiles,
   For fun watched each other's windows.

 You lounged, like a boy of the South,
   Cap and blouse—nay, a bit of beard too;
Or you got it, rubbing your mouth
   With fingers the clay adhered to.

 And I—soon managed to find
   Weak points in the flower-fence facing,
Was forced to put up a blind
   And be safe in my corset-lacing.

 No harm! It was not my fault
   If you never turned your eye's tail up
As I shook upon E in alt,
   Or ran the chromatic scale up:

 For spring bade the sparrows pair,
   And the boys and girls gave guesses,
And stalls in our street looked rare
   With bulrush and watercresses.

 Why did not you pinch a flower
   In a pellet of clay and fling it?
Why did not I put a power
   Of thanks in a look, or sing it?

 I did look, sharp as a lynx,
   (And yet the memory rankles,)
When models arrived, some minx
   Tripped up-stairs, she and her ankles.

 But I think I gave you as good!
   ""That foreign fellow,—who can know
How she pays, in a playful mood,
   For his tuning her that piano?""

 Could you say so, and never say
   ""Suppose we join hands and fortunes,
And I fetch her from over the way,
   Her, piano, and long tunes and short tunes?""

 No, no: you would not be rash,
   Nor I rasher and something over:
You've to settle yet Gibson's hash,
   And Grisi yet lives in clover.

 But you meet the Prince at the Board,
   I'm queen myself at bals-paré,
I've married a rich old lord,
   And you're dubbed knight and an R.A.

 Each life unfulfilled, you see;
   It hangs still, patchy and scrappy:
We have not sighed deep, laughed free,
   Starved, feasted, despaired,—been happy.

 And nobody calls you a dunce,
   And people suppose me clever:

That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not
Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Love among the Ruins,"Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,
     Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
     Half-asleep
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop
     As they crop—
Was the site once of a city great and gay,
     (So they say)
Of our country's very capital, its prince
     Ages since
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far
     Peace or war.

Now the country does not even boast a tree,
     As you see,
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills
     From the hills
Intersect and give a name to, (else they run
     Into one)
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
     Up like fires
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall
     Bounding all
Made of marble, men might march on nor be prest
     Twelve abreast.

And such plenty and perfection, see, of grass
     Never was!
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads
     And embeds
Every vestige of the city, guessed alone,
     Stock or stone—
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
     Long ago;
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame
     Struck them tame;
And that glory and that shame alike, the gold
     Bought and sold.

Now—the single little turret that remains
     On the plains,
By the caper overrooted, by the gourd
     Overscored,
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks
     Through the chinks—
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
     Sprang sublime,
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced
     As they raced,
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
     Viewed the games.

And I know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve
     Smiles to leave
To their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece
     In such peace,
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey
     Melt away—
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
     Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
     For the goal,
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
       Till I come.

But he looked upon the city, every side,
     Far and wide,
All the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'
     Colonnades,
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,—and then
     All the men!
When I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,
     Either hand
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace
     Of my face,
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech
     Each on each.

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
     South and North,
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
     As the sky
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force—
     Gold, of course.
O heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!
     Earth's returns
For whole centuries of folly, noise and sin!
     Shut them in,
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest!

Half-emperors and quarter-emperors,
Each with his bay-leaf fillet, loose-thonged vest,
Loric and low-browed Gorgon on the breast,—
One loves a baby face, with violets there,
Violets instead of laurel in the hair,
As those were all the little locks could bear.

Now read here. ""Protus ends a period
""Of empery beginning with a god;
""Born in the porphyry chamber at Byzant,

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Porphyria's Lover,"The rain set early in to-night, 
       The sullen wind was soon awake, 
It tore the elm-tops down for spite, 
       And did its worst to vex the lake: 
       I listened with heart fit to break. 
When glided in Porphyria; straight 
       She shut the cold out and the storm, 
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate 
       Blaze up, and all the cottage warm; 
       Which done, she rose, and from her form 
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl, 
       And laid her soiled gloves by, untied 
Her hat and let the damp hair fall, 
       And, last, she sat down by my side 
       And called me. When no voice replied, 
She put my arm about her waist, 
       And made her smooth white shoulder bare, 
And all her yellow hair displaced, 
       And, stooping, made my cheek lie there, 
       And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair, 
Murmuring how she loved me — she 
       Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour, 
To set its struggling passion free 
       From pride, and vainer ties dissever, 
       And give herself to me for ever. 
But passion sometimes would prevail, 
       Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain 
A sudden thought of one so pale 
       For love of her, and all in vain: 
       So, she was come through wind and rain. 
Be sure I looked up at her eyes 
       Happy and proud; at last I knew 
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise 
       Made my heart swell, and still it grew 
       While I debated what to do. 
That moment she was mine, mine, fair, 
       Perfectly pure and good: I found 
A thing to do, and all her hair 
       In one long yellow string I wound 
       Three times her little throat around, 
And strangled her. No pain felt she; 
       I am quite sure she felt no pain. 
As a shut bud that holds a bee, 
       I warily oped her lids: again 
       Laughed the blue eyes without a stain. 
And I untightened next the tress 
       About her neck; her cheek once more 
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss: 
       I propped her head up as before, 
       Only, this time my shoulder bore 
Her head, which droops upon it still: 
       The smiling rosy little head, 
So glad it has its utmost will, 
       That all it scorned at once is fled, 
       And I, its love, am gained instead! 
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how 
       Her darling one wish would be heard. 
And thus we sit together now, 
       And all night long we have not stirred, 
       And yet God has not said a word!",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Relationships', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Horror', 'Dramatic Monologue']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46313/porphyrias-lover,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-browning,,1812.0,1889.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Robert Browning,1812–1889,Count Gismond—Aix in Provence,"Christ God who savest man, save most
   Of men Count Gismond who saved me!
Count Gauthier, when he chose his post,
   Chose time and place and company
To suit it; when he struck at length
My honour, 't was with all his strength.

And doubtlessly, ere he could draw
   All points to one, he must have schemed!
That miserable morning saw
   Few half so happy as I seemed,
While being dressed in queen's array
To give our tourney prize away.

I thought they loved me, did me grace
   To please themselves; 't was all their deed;
God makes, or fair or foul, our face;
   If showing mine so caused to bleed
My cousins' hearts, they should have dropped
A word, and straight the play had stopped.

They, too, so beauteous! Each a queen
   By virtue of her brow and breast;
Not needing to be crowned, I mean,
   As I do. E'en when I was dressed,
Had either of them spoke, instead
Of glancing sideways with still head!

But no: they let me laugh, and sing
   My birthday song quite through, adjust
The last rose in my garland, fling
   A last look on the mirror, trust
My arms to each an arm of theirs,
And so descend the castle-stairs-

And come out on the morning troop
   Of merry friends who kissed my cheek,
And called me queen, and made me stoop
   Under the canopy-(a streak
That pierced it, of the outside sun,
Powdered with gold its gloom's soft dun)-

And they could let me take my state
   And foolish throne amid applause
Of all come there to celebrate
   My queen's-day-Oh I think the cause
Of much was, they forgot no crowd
Makes up for parents in their shroud!

However that be, all eyes were bent
   Upon me, when my cousins cast
Theirs down; 't was time I should present
   The victor's crown, but ... there, 't will last
No long time ... the old mist again
Blinds me as then it did. How vain!

See! Gismond's at the gate, in talk
   With his two boys: I can proceed.
Well, at that moment, who should stalk
   Forth boldly-to my face, indeed-
But Gauthier? and he thundered ""Stay!""
And all stayed. ""Bring no crowns, I say!

""Bring torches! Wind the penance-sheet
   ""About her! Let her shun the chaste,
""Or lay herself before their feet!
   ""Shall she, whose body I embraced
""A night long, queen it in the day?
""For honour's sake no crowns, I say!""

I? What I answered? As I live,
   I never fancied such a thing
As answer possible to give.
   What says the body when they spring
Some monstrous torture-engine's whole
Strength on it? No more says the soul.

Till out strode Gismond; then I knew
   That I was saved. I never met
His face before, but, at first view,
   I felt quite sure that God had set
Himself to Satan; would who spend
A minute's mistrust on the end?

He strode to Gauthier, in his throat
   Gave him the lie, then struck his mouth
With one back-handed blow that wrote
   In blood men's verdict there. North, South,
East, West, I looked. The lie was dead,
And damned, and truth stood up instead.

This glads me most, that I enjoyed
   The heart o' the joy, with my content
In watching Gismond unalloyed
   By any doubt of the event:
God took that on him-I was bid
Watch Gismond for my part: I did.

Did I not watch him while he let
   His armourer just brace his greaves,
Rivet his hauberk, on the fret
   The while! His foot ... my memory leaves
No least stamp out nor how anon
He pulled his ringing gauntlets on.

And e'en before the trumpet's sound
   Was finished, prone lay the false knight,
Prone as his lie, upon the ground:
   Gismond flew at him, used no sleight
O' the sword, but open-breasted drove,
Cleaving till out the truth he clove.

Which done, he dragged him to my feet
   And said, ""Here die, but end thy breath
""In full confession, lest thou fleet
   ""From my first, to God's second death!
""Say, hast thou lied? ""And, ""I have lied
""To God and her,""he said, and died.

Then Gismond, kneeling to me, asked
   -What safe my heart holds, though no word
Could I repeat now, if I tasked
   My powers for ever, to a third
Dear even as you are. Pass the rest
Until I sank upon his breast.

Over my head his arm he flung
   Against the world; and scarce I felt
His sword (that dripped by me and swung)
   A little shifted in its belt:
For he began to say the while
How South our home lay many a mile.

So, 'mid the shouting multitude
   We two walked forth to never more
Return. My cousins have pursued
   Their life, untroubled as before
I vexed them. Gauthier's dwelling-place
God lighten! May his soul find grace!

Our elder boy has got the clear
   Great brow, tho' when his brother's black
Full eye shows scorn, it ... Gismond here?
   And have you brought my tercel back?

Robert Browning,1812–1889,The Laboratory,"Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly, 
May gaze thro’ these faint smokes curling whitely, 
As thou pliest thy trade in this devil’s-smithy— 
Which is the poison to poison her, prithee? 
 
   He is with her, and they know that I know 
Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow 
While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear 
Empty church, to pray God in, for them!—I am here. 
 
   Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste, 
Pound at thy powder,—I am not in haste! 
Better sit thus and observe thy strange things, 
Than go where men wait me and dance at the King’s. 
 
   That in the mortar—you call it a gum? 
Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come! 
And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue, 
Sure to taste sweetly,—is that poison too? 
 
   Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures, 
What a wild crowd of invisible pleasures! 
To carry pure death in an earring, a casket, 
A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket! 
 
   Soon, at the King’s, a mere lozenge to give 
And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live! 
But to light a pastile, and Elise, with her head 
And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead! 
 
   Quick—is it finished? The colour’s too grim! 
Why not soft like the phial’s, enticing and dim? 
Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir, 
And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer! 
 
   What a drop! She’s not little, no minion like me— 
That’s why she ensnared him: this never will free 
The soul from those masculine eyes,—say, “no!” 
To that pulse’s magnificent come-and-go. 
 
   For only last night, as they whispered, I brought 
My own eyes to bear on her so, that I thought 
Could I keep them one half minute fixed, she would fall, 
Shrivelled; she fell not; yet this does it all! 
 
   Not that I bid you spare her the pain! 
Let death be felt and the proof remain; 
Brand, burn up, bite into its grace— 
He is sure to remember her dying face! 
 
   Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose; 
It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close: 
The delicate droplet, my whole fortune’s fee— 
If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me? 
 
   Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill, 
You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!

Robert Browning,1812–1889,The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church,"Rome, 15—

Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity! 
Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back? 
Nephews—sons mine . . . ah God, I know not! Well— 
She, men would have to be your mother once, 
Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was! 
What's done is done, and she is dead beside, 
Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since, 
And as she died so must we die ourselves, 
And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream. 
Life, how and what is it? As here I lie 
In this state-chamber, dying by degrees, 
Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask 
""Do I live, am I dead?"" Peace, peace seems all. 
Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace; 
And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought 
With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know: 
—Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care; 
Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South 
He graced his carrion with, God curse the same! 
Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence 
One sees the pulpit o' the epistle-side, 
And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats, 
And up into the aery dome where live 
The angels, and a sunbeam's sure to lurk: 
And I shall fill my slab of basalt there, 
And 'neath my tabernacle take my rest, 
With those nine columns round me, two and two, 
The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands: 
Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe 
As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse. 
—Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone, 
Put me where I may look at him! True peach, 
Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize! 
Draw close: that conflagration of my church 
—What then? So much was saved if aught were missed! 
My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig 
The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood, 
Drop water gently till the surface sink, 
And if ye find . . . Ah God, I know not, I! ... 
Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft, 
And corded up in a tight olive-frail, 
Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli, 
Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape, 
Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast ... 
Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all, 
That brave Frascati villa with its bath, 
So, let the blue lump poise between my knees, 
Like God the Father's globe on both His hands 
Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay, 
For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst! 
Swift as a weaver's shuttle fleet our years: 
Man goeth to the grave, and where is he? 
Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black— 
'Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else 
Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath? 
The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me, 
Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance 
Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so, 
The Saviour at his sermon on the mount, 
Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan 
Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off, 
And Moses with the tables . . . but I know 
Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee, 
Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope 
To revel down my villas while I gasp 
Bricked o'er with beggar's mouldy travertine 
Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at! 
Nay, boys, ye love me—all of jasper, then! 
'Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve. 
My bath must needs be left behind, alas! 
One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut, 
There's plenty jasper somewhere in the world— 
And have I not Saint Praxed's ear to pray 
Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts, 
And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs? 
—That's if ye carve my epitaph aright, 
Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word, 
No gaudy ware like Gandolf's second line— 
Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need! 
And then how I shall lie through centuries, 
And hear the blessed mutter of the mass, 
And see God made and eaten all day long, 
And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste 
Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke! 
For as I lie here, hours of the dead night, 
Dying in state and by such slow degrees, 
I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook, 
And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point, 
And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop 
Into great laps and folds of sculptor's-work: 
And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts 
Grow, with a certain humming in my ears, 
About the life before I lived this life, 
And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests, 
Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount, 
Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes, 
And new-found agate urns as fresh as day, 
And marble's language, Latin pure, discreet, 
—Aha, ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend? 
No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best! 
Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage. 
All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope 
My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart? 
Ever your eyes were as a lizard's quick, 
They glitter like your mother's for my soul, 
Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze, 
Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase 
With grapes, and add a vizor and a Term, 
And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx 
That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down, 
To comfort me on my entablature 
Whereon I am to lie till I must ask 
""Do I live, am I dead?"" There, leave me, there! 
For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude 
To death—ye wish it—God, ye wish it! Stone— 
Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat 
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through— 
And no more lapis to delight the world! 
Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there, 
But in a row: and, going, turn your backs 
—Ay, like departing altar-ministrants, 
And leave me in my church, the church for peace, 
That I may watch at leisure if he leers—

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Andrea del Sarto,"But do not let us quarrel any more, 
No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once: 
Sit down and all shall happen as you wish. 
You turn your face, but does it bring your heart? 
I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear, 
Treat his own subject after his own way, 
Fix his own time, accept too his own price, 
And shut the money into this small hand 
When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly? 
Oh, I'll content him,—but to-morrow, Love! 
I often am much wearier than you think, 
This evening more than usual, and it seems 
As if—forgive now—should you let me sit 
Here by the window with your hand in mine 
And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole, 
Both of one mind, as married people use, 
Quietly, quietly the evening through, 
I might get up to-morrow to my work 
Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try. 
To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this! 
Your soft hand is a woman of itself, 
And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. 
Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve 
For each of the five pictures we require: 
It saves a model. So! keep looking so— 
My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds! 
—How could you ever prick those perfect ears, 
Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet— 
My face, my moon, my everybody's moon, 
Which everybody looks on and calls his, 
And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn, 
While she looks—no one's: very dear, no less. 
You smile? why, there's my picture ready made, 
There's what we painters call our harmony! 
A common greyness silvers everything,— 
All in a twilight, you and I alike 
—You, at the point of your first pride in me 
(That's gone you know),—but I, at every point; 
My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down 
To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole. 
There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; 
That length of convent-wall across the way 
Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; 
The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, 
And autumn grows, autumn in everything. 
Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape 
As if I saw alike my work and self 
And all that I was born to be and do, 
A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand. 
How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead; 
So free we seem, so fettered fast we are! 
I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie! 
This chamber for example—turn your head— 
All that's behind us! You don't understand 
Nor care to understand about my art, 
But you can hear at least when people speak: 
And that cartoon, the second from the door 
—It is the thing, Love! so such things should be— 
Behold Madonna!—I am bold to say. 
   I can do with my pencil what I know, 
What I see, what at bottom of my heart 
I wish for, if I ever wish so deep— 
Do easily, too—when I say, perfectly, 
I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, 
Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, 
And just as much they used to say in France. 
At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! 
No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: 
I do what many dream of, all their lives, 
—Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, 
And fail in doing. I could count twenty such 
On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, 
Who strive—you don't know how the others strive 
To paint a little thing like that you smeared 
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat,— 
Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says, 
(I know his name, no matter)—so much less! 
Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. 
There burns a truer light of God in them, 
In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, 
Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt 
This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. 
Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, 
Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, 
Enter and take their place there sure enough, 
Though they come back and cannot tell the world. 
My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. 
The sudden blood of these men! at a word— 
Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. 
I, painting from myself and to myself, 
Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame 
Or their praise either. Somebody remarks 
Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, 
His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, 
Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? 
Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? 
Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, 
Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey, 
Placid and perfect with my art: the worse! 
I know both what I want and what might gain, 
And yet how profitless to know, to sigh 
""Had I been two, another and myself, 
""Our head would have o'erlooked the world!"" No doubt. 
Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth 
The Urbinate who died five years ago. 
('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) 
Well, I can fancy how he did it all, 
Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, 
Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, 
Above and through his art—for it gives way; 
That arm is wrongly put—and there again— 
A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, 
Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, 
He means right—that, a child may understand. 
Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: 
But all the play, the insight and the stretch— 
(Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? 
Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, 
We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! 
Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think— 
More than I merit, yes, by many times. 
But had you—oh, with the same perfect brow, 
And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, 
And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird 
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare — 
Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! 
Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged 
""God and the glory! never care for gain. 
""The present by the future, what is that? 
""Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! 
""Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"" 
I might have done it for you. So it seems: 
Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. 
Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; 
The rest avail not. Why do I need you? 
What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? 
In this world, who can do a thing, will not; 
And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: 
Yet the will's somewhat—somewhat, too, the power— 
And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, 
God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. 
'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, 
That I am something underrated here, 
Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. 
I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, 
For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. 
The best is when they pass and look aside; 
But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. 
Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, 
And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! 
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, 
Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, 
In that humane great monarch's golden look,— 
One finger in his beard or twisted curl 
Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, 
One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, 
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, 
I painting proudly with his breath on me, 
All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, 
Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls 
Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,— 
And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, 
This in the background, waiting on my work, 
To crown the issue with a last reward! 
A good time, was it not, my kingly days? 
And had you not grown restless... but I know— 
'Tis done and past: 'twas right, my instinct said: 
Too live the life grew, golden and not grey, 
And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt 
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. 
How could it end in any other way? 
You called me, and I came home to your heart. 
The triumph was—to reach and stay there; since 
I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? 
Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, 
You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! 
""Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; 
""The Roman's is the better when you pray, 
""But still the other's Virgin was his wife—"" 
Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge 
Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows 
My better fortune, I resolve to think. 
For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, 
Said one day Agnolo, his very self, 
To Rafael . . . I have known it all these years . . . 
(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts 
Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, 
Too lifted up in heart because of it) 
""Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub 
""Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, 
""Who, were he set to plan and execute 
""As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, 
""Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!"" 
To Rafael's!—And indeed the arm is wrong. 
I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see, 
Give the chalk here—quick, thus, the line should go! 
Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! 
Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, 
(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? 
Do you forget already words like those?) 
If really there was such a chance, so lost,— 
Is, whether you're—not grateful—but more pleased. 
Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! 
This hour has been an hour! Another smile? 
If you would sit thus by me every night 
I should work better, do you comprehend? 
I mean that I should earn more, give you more. 
See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; 
Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, 
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. 
Come from the window, love,—come in, at last, 
Inside the melancholy little house 
We built to be so gay with. God is just. 
King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights 
When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, 
The walls become illumined, brick from brick 
Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, 
That gold of his I did cement them with! 
Let us but love each other. Must you go? 
That Cousin here again? he waits outside? 
Must see you—you, and not with me? Those loans? 
More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? 
Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? 
While hand and eye and something of a heart 
Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? 
I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit 
The grey remainder of the evening out, 
Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly 
How I could paint, were I but back in France, 
One picture, just one more—the Virgin's face, 
Not yours this time! I want you at my side 
To hear them—that is, Michel Agnolo— 
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. 
Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend. 
I take the subjects for his corridor, 
Finish the portrait out of hand—there, there, 
And throw him in another thing or two 
If he demurs; the whole should prove enough 
To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, 
What's better and what's all I care about, 
Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! 
Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he, 
The Cousin! what does he to please you more? 
 
I am grown peaceful as old age to-night. 
I regret little, I would change still less. 
Since there my past life lies, why alter it? 
The very wrong to Francis!—it is true 
I took his coin, was tempted and complied, 
And built this house and sinned, and all is said. 
My father and my mother died of want. 
Well, had I riches of my own? you see 
How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot. 
They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died: 
And I have laboured somewhat in my time 
And not been paid profusely. Some good son 
Paint my two hundred pictures—let him try! 
No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes, 
You loved me quite enough. it seems to-night. 
This must suffice me here. What would one have? 
In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance— 
Four great walls in the New Jerusalem, 
Meted on each side by the angel's reed, 
For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me 
To cover—the three first without a wife, 
While I have mine! So—still they overcome 
Because there's still Lucrezia,—as I choose.

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Cleon,"""As certain also of your own poets have said""— 
(Acts 17.28) 


Cleon the poet (from the sprinkled isles, 
Lily on lily, that o'erlace the sea 
And laugh their pride when the light wave lisps ""Greece"")— 
To Protus in his Tyranny: much health! 
 
    They give thy letter to me, even now: 
I read and seem as if I heard thee speak. 
The master of thy galley still unlades 
Gift after gift; they block my court at last 
And pile themselves along its portico 
Royal with sunset, like a thought of thee: 
And one white she-slave from the group dispersed 
Of black and white slaves (like the chequer-work 
Pavement, at once my nation's work and gift, 
Now covered with this settle-down of doves), 
One lyric woman, in her crocus vest 
Woven of sea-wools, with her two white hands 
Commends to me the strainer and the cup 
Thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses mine. 
 
    Well-counselled, king, in thy munificence! 
For so shall men remark, in such an act 
Of love for him whose song gives life its joy,— 
Thy recognition of the use of life; 
Nor call thy spirit barely adequate 
To help on life in straight ways, broad enough 
For vulgar souls, by ruling and the rest. 
Thou, in the daily building of thy tower,— 
Whether in fierce and sudden spasms of toil, 
Or through dim lulls of unapparent growth, 
Or when the general work 'mid good acclaim 
Climbed with the eye to cheer the architect,— 
Didst ne'er engage in work for mere work's sake— 
Hadst ever in thy heart the luring hope 
Of some eventual rest a-top of it, 
Whence, all the tumult of the building hushed, 
Thou first of men might'st look out to the East: 
The vulgar saw thy tower, thou sawest the sun. 
For this, I promise on thy festival 
To pour libation, looking o'er the sea, 
Making this slave narrate thy fortunes, speak 
Thy great words, and describe thy royal face— 
Wishing thee wholly where Zeus lives the most, 
Within the eventual element of calm. 
 
    Thy letter's first requirement meets me here. 
It is as thou hast heard: in one short life 
I, Cleon, have effected all those things 
Thou wonderingly dost enumerate. 
That epos on thy hundred plates of gold 
Is mine,—and also mine the little chant, 
So sure to rise from every fishing-bark 
When, lights at prow, the seamen haul their net. 
The image of the sun-god on the phare, 
Men turn from the sun's self to see, is mine; 
The Pœcile o'er-storied its whole length, 
As thou didst hear, with painting, is mine too. 
I know the true proportions of a man 
And woman also, not observed before; 
And I have written three books on the soul, 
Proving absurd all written hitherto, 
And putting us to ignorance again. 
For music,—why, I have combined the moods, 
Inventing one. In brief, all arts are mine; 
Thus much the people know and recognize, 
Throughout our seventeen islands. Marvel not. 
We of these latter days, with greater mind 
Than our forerunners, since more composite, 
Look not so great, beside their simple way, 
To a judge who only sees one way at once, 
One mind-point and no other at a time,— 
Compares the small part of a man of us 
With some whole man of the heroic age, 
Great in his way—not ours, nor meant for ours. 
And ours is greater, had we skill to know: 
For, what we call this life of men on earth, 
This sequence of the soul's achievements here 
Being, as I find much reason to conceive, 
Intended to be viewed eventually 
As a great whole, not analyzed to parts, 
But each part having reference to all,— 
How shall a certain part, pronounced complete, 
Endure effacement by another part? 
Was the thing done?—then, what's to do again? 
See, in the chequered pavement opposite, 
Suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb, 
And next a lozenge, then a trapezoid— 
He did not overlay them, superimpose 
The new upon the old and blot it out, 
But laid them on a level in his work, 
Making at last a picture; there it lies. 
So, first the perfect separate forms were made, 
The portions of mankind; and after, so, 
Occurred the combination of the same. 
For where had been a progress, otherwise? 
Mankind, made up of all the single men,— 
In such a synthesis the labour ends. 
Now mark me! those divine men of old time 
Have reached, thou sayest well, each at one point 
The outside verge that rounds our faculty; 
And where they reached, who can do more than reach? 
It takes but little water just to touch 
At some one point the inside of a sphere, 
And, as we turn the sphere, touch all the rest 
In due succession: but the finer air 
Which not so palpably nor obviously, 
Though no less universally, can touch 
The whole circumference of that emptied sphere, 
Fills it more fully than the water did; 
Holds thrice the weight of water in itself 
Resolved into a subtler element. 
And yet the vulgar call the sphere first full 
Up to the visible height—and after, void; 
Not knowing air's more hidden properties. 
And thus our soul, misknown, cries out to Zeus 
To vindicate his purpose in our life: 
Why stay we on the earth unless to grow? 
Long since, I imaged, wrote the fiction out, 
That he or other god descended here 
And, once for all, showed simultaneously 
What, in its nature, never can be shown, 
Piecemeal or in succession;—showed, I say, 
The worth both absolute and relative 
Of all his children from the birth of time, 
His instruments for all appointed work. 
I now go on to image,—might we hear 
The judgment which should give the due to each, 
Show where the labour lay and where the ease, 
And prove Zeus' self, the latent everywhere! 
This is a dream:—but no dream, let us hope, 
That years and days, the summers and the springs, 
Follow each other with unwaning powers. 
The grapes which dye thy wine are richer far, 
Through culture, than the wild wealth of the rock; 
The suave plum than the savage-tasted drupe; 
The pastured honey-bee drops choicer sweet; 
The flowers turn double, and the leaves turn flowers; 
That young and tender crescent-moon, thy slave, 
Sleeping above her robe as buoyed by clouds, 
Refines upon the women of my youth. 
What, and the soul alone deteriorates? 
I have not chanted verse like Homer, no— 
Nor swept string like Terpander, no—nor carved 
And painted men like Phidias and his friend: 
I am not great as they are, point by point. 
But I have entered into sympathy 
With these four, running these into one soul, 
Who, separate, ignored each other's art. 
Say, is it nothing that I know them all? 
The wild flower was the larger; I have dashed 
Rose-blood upon its petals, pricked its cup's 
Honey with wine, and driven its seed to fruit, 
And show a better flower if not so large: 
I stand myself. Refer this to the gods 
Whose gift alone it is! which, shall I dare 
(All pride apart) upon the absurd pretext 
That such a gift by chance lay in my hand, 
Discourse of lightly or depreciate? 
It might have fallen to another's hand: what then? 
I pass too surely: let at least truth stay! 
 
    And next, of what thou followest on to ask. 
This being with me as I declare, O king, 
My works, in all these varicoloured kinds, 
So done by me, accepted so by men— 
Thou askest, if (my soul thus in men's hearts) 
I must not be accounted to attain 
The very crown and proper end of life? 
Inquiring thence how, now life closeth up, 
I face death with success in my right hand: 
Whether I fear death less than dost thyself 
The fortunate of men? ""For"" (writest thou) 
""Thou leavest much behind, while I leave nought. 
Thy life stays in the poems men shall sing, 
The pictures men shall study; while my life, 
Complete and whole now in its power and joy, 
Dies altogether with my brain and arm, 
Is lost indeed; since, what survives myself? 
The brazen statue to o'erlook my grave, 
Set on the promontory which I named. 
And that—some supple courtier of my heir 
Shall use its robed and sceptred arm, perhaps, 
To fix the rope to, which best drags it down. 
I go then: triumph thou, who dost not go!"" 
 
    Nay, thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind. 
Is this apparent, when thou turn'st to muse 
Upon the scheme of earth and man in chief, 
That admiration grows as knowledge grows? 
That imperfection means perfection hid, 
Reserved in part, to grace the after-time? 
If, in the morning of philosophy, 
Ere aught had been recorded, nay perceived, 
Thou, with the light now in thee, couldst have looked 
On all earth's tenantry, from worm to bird, 
Ere man, her last, appeared upon the stage— 
Thou wouldst have seen them perfect, and deduced 
The perfectness of others yet unseen. 
Conceding which,—had Zeus then questioned thee, 
""Shall I go on a step, improve on this, 
Do more for visible creatures than is done?"" 
Thou wouldst have answered, ""Ay, by making each 
Grow conscious in himself—by that alone. 
All's perfect else: the shell sucks fast the rock, 
The fish strikes through the sea, the snake both swims 
And slides, forth range the beasts, the birds take flight, 
Till life's mechanics can no further go— 
And all this joy in natural life is put 
Like fire from off thy finger into each, 
So exquisitely perfect is the same. 
But 'tis pure fire, and they mere matter are; 
It has them, not they it: and so I choose 
For man, thy last premeditated work 
(If I might add a glory to the scheme), 
That a third thing should stand apart from both, 
A quality arise within his soul, 
Which, intro-active, made to supervise 
And feel the force it has, may view itself, 
And so be happy."" Man might live at first 
The animal life: but is there nothing more? 
In due time, let him critically learn 
How he lives; and, the more he gets to know 
Of his own life's adaptabilities, 
The more joy-giving will his life become. 
Thus man, who hath this quality, is best. 
 
    But thou, king, hadst more reasonably said: 
""Let progress end at once,—man make no step 
Beyond the natural man, the better beast, 
Using his senses, not the sense of sense."" 
In man there's failure, only since he left 
The lower and inconscious forms of life. 
We called it an advance, the rendering plain 
Man's spirit might grow conscious of man's life, 
And, by new lore so added to the old, 
Take each step higher over the brute's head. 
This grew the only life, the pleasure-house, 
Watch-tower and treasure-fortress of the soul, 
Which whole surrounding flats of natural life 
Seemed only fit to yield subsistence to; 
A tower that crowns a country. But alas, 
The soul now climbs it just to perish there! 
For thence we have discovered ('tis no dream— 
We know this, which we had not else perceived) 
That there's a world of capability 
For joy, spread round about us, meant for us, 
Inviting us; and still the soul craves all, 
And still the flesh replies, ""Take no jot more 
Than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad! 
Nay, so much less as that fatigue has brought 
Deduction to it."" We struggle, fain to enlarge 
Our bounded physical recipiency, 
Increase our power, supply fresh oil to life, 
Repair the waste of age and sickness: no, 
It skills not! life's inadequate to joy, 
As the soul sees joy, tempting life to take. 
They praise a fountain in my garden here 
Wherein a Naiad sends the water-bow 
Thin from her tube; she smiles to see it rise. 
What if I told her, it is just a thread 
From that great river which the hills shut up, 
And mock her with my leave to take the same? 
The artificer has given her one small tube 
Past power to widen or exchange—what boots 
To know she might spout oceans if she could? 
She cannot lift beyond her first thin thread: 
And so a man can use but a man's joy 
While he sees God's. Is it for Zeus to boast, 
""See, man, how happy I live, and despair— 
That I may be still happier—for thy use!"" 
If this were so, we could not thank our lord, 
As hearts beat on to doing; 'tis not so— 
Malice it is not. Is it carelessness? 
Still, no. If care—where is the sign? I ask, 
And get no answer, and agree in sum, 
O king, with thy profound discouragement, 
Who seest the wider but to sigh the more. 
Most progress is most failure: thou sayest well. 
 
    The last point now:—thou dost except a case— 
Holding joy not impossible to one 
With artist-gifts—to such a man as I 
Who leave behind me living works indeed; 
For, such a poem, such a painting lives. 
What? dost thou verily trip upon a word, 
Confound the accurate view of what joy is 
(Caught somewhat clearer by my eyes than thine) 
With feeling joy? confound the knowing how 
And showing how to live (my faculty) 
With actually living?—Otherwise 
Where is the artist's vantage o'er the king? 
Because in my great epos I display 
How divers men young, strong, fair, wise, can act— 
Is this as though I acted? if I paint, 
Carve the young Phoebus, am I therefore young? 
Methinks I'm older that I bowed myself 
The many years of pain that taught me art! 
Indeed, to know is something, and to prove 
How all this beauty might be enjoyed, is more: 
But, knowing nought, to enjoy is something too. 
Yon rower, with the moulded muscles there, 
Lowering the sail, is nearer it than I. 
I can write love-odes: thy fair slave's an ode. 
I get to sing of love, when grown too grey 
For being beloved: she turns to that young man, 
The muscles all a-ripple on his back. 
I know the joy of kingship: well, thou art king! 
 
    ""But,"" sayest thou—(and I marvel, I repeat, 
To find thee trip on such a mere word) ""what 
Thou writest, paintest, stays; that does not die: 
Sappho survives, because we sing her songs, 
And Aeschylus, because we read his plays!"" 
Why, if they live still, let them come and take 
Thy slave in my despite, drink from thy cup, 
Speak in my place. Thou diest while I survive? 
Say rather that my fate is deadlier still, 
In this, that every day my sense of joy 
Grows more acute, my soul (intensified 
By power and insight) more enlarged, more keen; 
While every day my hairs fall more and more, 
My hand shakes, and the heavy years increase— 
The horror quickening still from year to year, 
The consummation coming past escape, 
When I shall know most, and yet least enjoy— 
When all my works wherein I prove my worth, 
Being present still to mock me in men's mouths, 
Alive still, in the praise of such as thou, 
I, I the feeling, thinking, acting man, 
The man who loved his life so over-much, 
Sleep in my urn. It is so horrible, 
I dare at times imagine to my need 
Some future state revealed to us by Zeus, 
Unlimited in capability 
For joy, as this is in desire for joy, 
—To seek which, the joy-hunger forces us: 
That, stung by straitness of our life, made strait 
On purpose to make prized the life at large— 
Freed by the throbbing impulse we call death, 
We burst there as the worm into the fly, 
Who, while a worm still, wants his wings. But no! 
Zeus has not yet revealed it; and alas, 
He must have done so, were it possible! 
 
    Live long and happy, and in that thought die: 
Glad for what was! Farewell. And for the rest, 
I cannot tell thy messenger aright 
Where to deliver what he bears of thine 
To one called Paulus; we have heard his fame 
Indeed, if Christus be not one with him— 
I know not, nor am troubled much to know. 
Thou canst not think a mere barbarian Jew, 
As Paulus proves to be, one circumcised, 
Hath access to a secret shut from us? 
Thou wrongest our philosophy, O king, 
In stooping to inquire of such an one, 
As if his answer could impose at all! 
He writeth, doth he? well, and he may write. 
Oh, the Jew findeth scholars! certain slaves 
Who touched on this same isle, preached him and Christ;

Robert Browning,1812–1889,"An Epistle Containing the Strange Medical Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician","Karshish, the picker-up of learning's crumbs,
The not-incurious in God's handiwork
(This man's-flesh he hath admirably made,
Blown like a bubble, kneaded like a paste,
To coop up and keep down on earth a space
That puff of vapour from his mouth, man's soul)
—To Abib, all-sagacious in our art,
Breeder in me of what poor skill I boast,
Like me inquisitive how pricks and cracks
Befall the flesh through too much stress and strain,
Whereby the wily vapour fain would slip
Back and rejoin its source before the term,—
And aptest in contrivance (under God)
To baffle it by deftly stopping such:—
The vagrant Scholar to his Sage at home
Sends greeting (health and knowledge, fame with peace)
Three samples of true snakestone—rarer still,
One of the other sort, the melon-shaped,
(But fitter, pounded fine, for charms than drugs)
And writeth now the twenty-second time.

My journeyings were brought to Jericho;
Thus I resume. Who studious in our art
Shall count a little labour unrepaid?
I have shed sweat enough, left flesh and bone
On many a flinty furlong of this land.
Also, the country-side is all on fire
With rumours of a marching hitherward:
Some say Vespasian cometh, some, his son.
A black lynx snarled and pricked a tufted ear;
Lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls:
I cried and threw my staff and he was gone.
Twice have the robbers stripped and beaten me,
And once a town declared me for a spy;
But at the end, I reach Jerusalem,
Since this poor covert where I pass the night,
This Bethany, lies scarce the distance thence
A man with plague-sores at the third degree
Runs till he drops down dead. Thou laughest here!
'Sooth, it elates me, thus reposed and safe,
To void the stuffing of my travel-scrip
And share with thee whatever Jewry yields
A viscid choler is observable
In tertians, I was nearly bold to say;
And falling-sickness hath a happier cure
Than our school wots of: there's a spider here
Weaves no web, watches on the ledge of tombs,
Sprinkled with mottles on an ash-grey back;
Take five and drop them . . . but who knows his mind,
The Syrian runagate I trust this to?
His service payeth me a sublimate
Blown up his nose to help the ailing eye.
Best wait: I reach Jerusalem at morn,
There set in order my experiences,
Gather what most deserves, and give thee all—
Or I might add, Judea's gum-tragacanth
Scales off in purer flakes, shines clearer-grained,
Cracks 'twixt the pestle and the porphyry,
In fine exceeds our produce. Scalp-disease
Confounds me, crossing so with leprosy—
Thou hadst admired one sort I gained at Zoar—
But zeal outruns discretion. Here I end.

Yet stay: my Syrian blinketh gratefully,
Protesteth his devotion is my price—
Suppose I write what harms not, though he steal?
I half resolve to tell thee, yet I blush,
What set me off a-writing first of all.
An itch I had, a sting to write, a tang!
For, be it this town's barrenness—or else
The Man had something in the look of him—
His case has struck me far more than 'tis worth.
So, pardon if—(lest presently I lose
In the great press of novelty at hand
The care and pains this somehow stole from me)
I bid thee take the thing while fresh in mind,
Almost in sight—for, wilt thou have the truth?
The very man is gone from me but now,
Whose ailment is the subject of discourse.
Thus then, and let thy better wit help all!

'Tis but a case of mania—subinduced
By epilepsy, at the turning-point
Of trance prolonged unduly some three days:
When, by the exhibition of some drug
Or spell, exorcization, stroke of art
Unknown to me and which 'twere well to know,
The evil thing out-breaking all at once
Left the man whole and sound of body indeed,—
But, flinging (so to speak) life's gates too wide,
Making a clear house of it too suddenly,
The first conceit that entered might inscribe
Whatever it was minded on the wall
So plainly at that vantage, as it were,
(First come, first served) that nothing subsequent
Attaineth to erase those fancy-scrawls
The just-returned and new-established soul
Hath gotten now so thoroughly by heart
That henceforth she will read or these or none.
And first—the man's own firm conviction rests
That he was dead (in fact they buried him)
—That he was dead and then restored to life
By a Nazarene physician of his tribe:
—'Sayeth, the same bade ""Rise,"" and he did rise.
""Such cases are diurnal,"" thou wilt cry.
Not so this figment!—not, that such a fume,
Instead of giving way to time and health,
Should eat itself into the life of life,
As saffron tingeth flesh, blood, bones and all!
For see, how he takes up the after-life.
The man—it is one Lazarus a Jew,
Sanguine, proportioned, fifty years of age,
The body's habit wholly laudable,
As much, indeed, beyond the common health
As he were made and put aside to show.
Think, could we penetrate by any drug
And bathe the wearied soul and worried flesh,
And bring it clear and fair, by three days' sleep!
Whence has the man the balm that brightens all?
This grown man eyes the world now like a child.
Some elders of his tribe, I should premise,
Led in their friend, obedient as a sheep,
To bear my inquisition. While they spoke,
Now sharply, now with sorrow,—told the case,—
He listened not except I spoke to him,
But folded his two hands and let them talk,
Watching the flies that buzzed: and yet no fool.
And that's a sample how his years must go.
Look, if a beggar, in fixed middle-life,
Should find a treasure,—can he use the same
With straitened habits and with tastes starved small,
And take at once to his impoverished brain
The sudden element that changes things,
That sets the undreamed-of rapture at his hand
And puts the cheap old joy in the scorned dust?
Is he not such an one as moves to mirth—
Warily parsimonious, when no need,
Wasteful as drunkenness at undue times?
All prudent counsel as to what befits
The golden mean, is lost on such an one
The man's fantastic will is the man's law.
So here—we call the treasure knowledge, say,
Increased beyond the fleshly faculty—
Heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth,
Earth forced on a soul's use while seeing heaven:
The man is witless of the size, the sum,
The value in proportion of all things,
Or whether it be little or be much.
Discourse to him of prodigious armaments
Assembled to besiege his city now,
And of the passing of a mule with gourds—
'Tis one! Then take it on the other side,
Speak of some trifling fact—he will gaze rapt
With stupor at its very littleness,
(Far as I see) as if in that indeed
He caught prodigious import, whole results;
And so will turn to us the bystanders
In ever the same stupor (note this point)
That we too see not with his opened eyes.
Wonder and doubt come wrongly into play,
Preposterously, at cross purposes.
Should his child sicken unto death,—why, look
For scarce abatement of his cheerfulness,
Or pretermission of the daily craft!
While a word, gesture, glance, from that same child
At play or in the school or laid asleep,
Will startle him to an agony of fear,
Exasperation, just as like. Demand
The reason why—"" tis but a word,"" object—
""A gesture""—he regards thee as our lord
Who lived there in the pyramid alone
Looked at us (dost thou mind?) when, being young,
We both would unadvisedly recite
Some charm's beginning, from that book of his,
Able to bid the sun throb wide and burst
All into stars, as suns grown old are wont.
Thou and the child have each a veil alike
Thrown o'er your heads, from under which ye both
Stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match
Over a mine of Greek fire, did ye know!
He holds on firmly to some thread of life—
(It is the life to lead perforcedly)
Which runs across some vast distracting orb
Of glory on either side that meagre thread,
Which, conscious of, he must not enter yet—
The spiritual life around the earthly life:
The law of that is known to him as this,
His heart and brain move there, his feet stay here.
So is the man perplext with impulses
Sudden to start off crosswise, not straight on,
Proclaiming what is right and wrong across,
And not along, this black thread through the blaze—
""It should be"" baulked by ""here it cannot be.""
And oft the man's soul springs into his face
As if he saw again and heard again
His sage that bade him ""Rise"" and he did rise.
Something, a word, a tick of the blood within
Admonishes: then back he sinks at once
To ashes, who was very fire before,
In sedulous recurrence to his trade
Whereby he earneth him the daily bread;
And studiously the humbler for that pride,
Professedly the faultier that he knows
God's secret, while he holds the thread of life.
Indeed the especial marking of the man
Is prone submission to the heavenly will—
Seeing it, what it is, and why it is.
'Sayeth, he will wait patient to the last
For that same death which must restore his being
To equilibrium, body loosening soul
Divorced even now by premature full growth:
He will live, nay, it pleaseth him to live
So long as God please, and just how God please.
He even seeketh not to please God more
(Which meaneth, otherwise) than as God please.
Hence, I perceive not he affects to preach
The doctrine of his sect whate'er it be,
Make proselytes as madmen thirst to do:
How can he give his neighbour the real ground,
His own conviction? Ardent as he is—
Call his great truth a lie, why, still the old
""Be it as God please"" reassureth him.
I probed the sore as thy disciple should:
""How, beast,"" said I, ""this stolid carelessness
Sufficeth thee, when Rome is on her march
To stamp out like a little spark thy town,
Thy tribe, thy crazy tale and thee at once?""
He merely looked with his large eyes on me.
The man is apathetic, you deduce?
Contrariwise, he loves both old and young,
Able and weak, affects the very brutes
And birds—how say I? flowers of the field—
As a wise workman recognizes tools
In a master's workshop, loving what they make.
Thus is the man as harmless as a lamb:
Only impatient, let him do his best,
At ignorance and carelessness and sin—
An indignation which is promptly curbed:
As when in certain travels I have feigned
To be an ignoramus in our art
According to some preconceived design,
And happed to hear the land's practitioners,
Steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance,
Prattle fantastically on disease,
Its cause and cure—and I must hold my peace!

Thou wilt object—why have I not ere this
Sought out the sage himself, the Nazarene
Who wrought this cure, inquiring at the source,
Conferring with the frankness that befits?
Alas! it grieveth me, the learned leech
Perished in a tumult many years ago,
Accused,—our learning's fate,—of wizardry,
Rebellion, to the setting up a rule
And creed prodigious as described to me.
His death, which happened when the earthquake fell
(Prefiguring, as soon appeared, the loss
To occult learning in our lord the sage
Who lived there in the pyramid alone)
Was wrought by the mad people—that's their wont!
On vain recourse, as I conjecture it,
To his tried virtue, for miraculous help—
How could he stop the earthquake? That's their way!
The other imputations must be lies:
But take one, though I loathe to give it thee,
In mere respect for any good man's fame.
(And after all, our patient Lazarus
Is stark mad; should we count on what he says?
Perhaps not: though in writing to a leech
'Tis well to keep back nothing of a case.)
This man so cured regards the curer, then
As—God forgive me! who but God himself,
Creator and sustainer of the world,
That came and dwelt in flesh on 't awhile!
—'Sayeth that such an one was born and lived,
Taught, healed the sick, broke bread at his own house,
Then died, with Lazarus by, for aught I know,
And yet was . . . what I said nor choose repeat,
And must have so avouched himself, in fact,
In hearing of this very Lazarus
Who saith—but why all this of what he saith?
Why write of trivial matters, things of price
Calling at every moment for remark?
I noticed on the margin of a pool
Blue-flowering borage, the Aleppo sort,
Aboundeth, very nitrous. It is strange!

Thy pardon for this long and tedious case,
Which, now that I review it, needs must seem
Unduly dwelt on, prolixly set forth!
Nor I myself discern in what is writ
Good cause for the peculiar interest
And awe indeed this man has touched me with.
Perhaps the journey's end, the weariness
Had wrought upon me first. I met him thus:
I crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills
Like an old lion's cheek teeth. Out there came
A moon made like a face with certain spots
Multiform, manifold, and menacing:
Then a wind rose behind me. So we met
In this old sleepy town at unaware,
The man and I. I send thee what is writ.
Regard it as a chance, a matter risked
To this ambiguous Syrian—he may lose,
Or steal, or give it thee with equal good.
Jerusalem's repose shall make amends
For time this letter wastes, thy time and mine;
Till when, once more thy pardon and farewell!

The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?
So, the All-Great, were the All-Loving too—
So, through the thunder comes a human voice
Saying, ""O heart I made, a heart beats here!
Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!
Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,
But love I gave thee, with myself to love,
And thou must love me who have died for thee!""

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Fra Lippo Lippi,"[Florentine painter, 1412-69]

I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!
You need not clap your torches to my face.
Zooks, what's to blame? you think you see a monk!
What, 'tis past midnight, and you go the rounds,
And here you catch me at an alley's end
Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar?
The Carmine's my cloister: hunt it up,
Do,—harry out, if you must show your zeal,
Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong hole,
And nip each softling of a wee white mouse,
Weke, weke, that's crept to keep him company!
Aha, you know your betters! Then, you'll take
Your hand away that's fiddling on my throat,
And please to know me likewise. Who am I?
Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a friend
Three streets off—he's a certain . . . how d'ye call?
Master—a ...Cosimo of the Medici,
I' the house that caps the corner. Boh! you were best!
Remember and tell me, the day you're hanged,
How you affected such a gullet's-gripe!
But you, sir, it concerns you that your knaves
Pick up a manner nor discredit you:
Zooks, are we pilchards, that they sweep the streets
And count fair price what comes into their net?
He's Judas to a tittle, that man is!
Just such a face! Why, sir, you make amends.
Lord, I'm not angry! Bid your hang-dogs go
Drink out this quarter-florin to the health
Of the munificent House that harbours me
(And many more beside, lads! more beside!)
And all's come square again. I'd like his face—
His, elbowing on his comrade in the door
With the pike and lantern,—for the slave that holds
John Baptist's head a-dangle by the hair
With one hand (""Look you, now,"" as who should say)
And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!
It's not your chance to have a bit of chalk,
A wood-coal or the like? or you should see!
Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so.
What, brother Lippo's doings, up and down,
You know them and they take you? like enough!
I saw the proper twinkle in your eye—
'Tell you, I liked your looks at very first.
Let's sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch.
Here's spring come, and the nights one makes up bands
To roam the town and sing out carnival,
And I've been three weeks shut within my mew,
A-painting for the great man, saints and saints
And saints again. I could not paint all night—
Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air.
There came a hurry of feet and little feet,
A sweep of lute strings, laughs, and whifts of song, —
Flower o' the broom,
Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!
Flower o' the quince,
I let Lisa go, and what good in life since?
Flower o' the thyme—and so on. Round they went.
Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter
Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight,—three slim shapes,
And a face that looked up . . . zooks, sir, flesh and blood,
That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went,
Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,
All the bed-furniture—a dozen knots,
There was a ladder! Down I let myself,
Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped,
And after them. I came up with the fun
Hard by Saint Laurence, hail fellow, well met,—
Flower o' the rose,
If I've been merry, what matter who knows?
And so as I was stealing back again
To get to bed and have a bit of sleep
Ere I rise up to-morrow and go work
On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast
With his great round stone to subdue the flesh,
You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see!
Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head—
Mine's shaved—a monk, you say—the sting 's in that!
If Master Cosimo announced himself,
Mum's the word naturally; but a monk!
Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now!
I was a baby when my mother died
And father died and left me in the street.
I starved there, God knows how, a year or two
On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks,
Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day,
My stomach being empty as your hat,
The wind doubled me up and down I went.
Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand,
(Its fellow was a stinger as I knew)
And so along the wall, over the bridge,
By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there,
While I stood munching my first bread that month:
""So, boy, you're minded,"" quoth the good fat father
Wiping his own mouth, 'twas refection-time,—
""To quit this very miserable world?
Will you renounce"" . . . ""the mouthful of bread?"" thought I;
By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me;
I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,
Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,
Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici
Have given their hearts to—all at eight years old.
Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,
'Twas not for nothing—the good bellyful,
The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,
And day-long blessed idleness beside!
""Let's see what the urchin's fit for""—that came next.
Not overmuch their way, I must confess.
Such a to-do! They tried me with their books:
Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste!
Flower o' the clove.
All the Latin I construe is, ""amo"" I love!
But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets
Eight years together, as my fortune was,
Watching folk's faces to know who will fling
The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,
And who will curse or kick him for his pains,—
Which gentleman processional and fine,
Holding a candle to the Sacrament,
Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch
The droppings of the wax to sell again,
Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped,—
How say I?—nay, which dog bites, which lets drop
His bone from the heap of offal in the street,—
Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,
He learns the look of things, and none the less
For admonition from the hunger-pinch.
I had a store of such remarks, be sure,
Which, after I found leisure, turned to use.
I drew men's faces on my copy-books,
Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge,
Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,
Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,
And made a string of pictures of the world
Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,
On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black.
""Nay,"" quoth the Prior, ""turn him out, d'ye say?
In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark.
What if at last we get our man of parts,
We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese
And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine
And put the front on it that ought to be!""
And hereupon he bade me daub away.
Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,
Never was such prompt disemburdening.
First, every sort of monk, the black and white,
I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church,
From good old gossips waiting to confess
Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends,—
To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,
Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there
With the little children round him in a row
Of admiration, half for his beard and half
For that white anger of his victim's son
Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,
Signing himself with the other because of Christ
(Whose sad face on the cross sees only this
After the passion of a thousand years)
Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,
(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve
On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,
Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers
(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone.
I painted all, then cried ""'Tis ask and have;
Choose, for more's ready!""—laid the ladder flat,
And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.
The monks closed in a circle and praised loud
Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,
Being simple bodies,—""That's the very man!
Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!
That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes
To care about his asthma: it's the life!''
But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked;
Their betters took their turn to see and say:
The Prior and the learned pulled a face
And stopped all that in no time. ""How? what's here?
Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!
Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true
As much as pea and pea! it's devil's-game!
Your business is not to catch men with show,
With homage to the perishable clay,
But lift them over it, ignore it all,
Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.
Your business is to paint the souls of men—
Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke . . . no, it's not . . .
It's vapour done up like a new-born babe—
(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)
It's . . . well, what matters talking, it's the soul!
Give us no more of body than shows soul!
Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,
That sets us praising—why not stop with him?
Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head
With wonder at lines, colours, and what not?
Paint the soul, never mind the legs and arms!
Rub all out, try at it a second time.
Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,
She's just my niece . . . Herodias, I would say,—
Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!
Have it all out!"" Now, is this sense, I ask?
A fine way to paint soul, by painting body
So ill, the eye can't stop there, must go further
And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white
When what you put for yellow's simply black,
And any sort of meaning looks intense
When all beside itself means and looks nought.
Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,
Left foot and right foot, go a double step,
Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,
Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,
The Prior's niece . . . patron-saint—is it so pretty
You can't discover if it means hope, fear,
Sorrow or joy? won't beauty go with these?
Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,
Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,
And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?
Or say there's beauty with no soul at all—
(I never saw it—put the case the same—)
If you get simple beauty and nought else,
You get about the best thing God invents:
That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,
Within yourself, when you return him thanks.
""Rub all out!"" Well, well, there's my life, in short,
And so the thing has gone on ever since.
I'm grown a man no doubt, I've broken bounds:
You should not take a fellow eight years old
And make him swear to never kiss the girls.
I'm my own master, paint now as I please—
Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!
Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front—
Those great rings serve more purposes than just
To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!
And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes
Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,
The heads shake still—""It's art's decline, my son!
You're not of the true painters, great and old;
Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find;
Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer:
Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!""
Flower o' the pine,
You keep your mistr ... manners, and I'll stick to mine!
I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know!
Don't you think they're the likeliest to know,
They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage,
Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint
To please them—sometimes do and sometimes don't;
For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come
A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints—
A laugh, a cry, the business of the world—
(Flower o' the peach
Death for us all, and his own life for each!)
And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over,
The world and life's too big to pass for a dream,
And I do these wild things in sheer despite,
And play the fooleries you catch me at,
In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass
After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so,
Although the miller does not preach to him
The only good of grass is to make chaff.
What would men have? Do they like grass or no—
May they or mayn't they? all I want's the thing
Settled for ever one way. As it is,
You tell too many lies and hurt yourself:
You don't like what you only like too much,
You do like what, if given you at your word,
You find abundantly detestable.
For me, I think I speak as I was taught;
I always see the garden and God there
A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned,
The value and significance of flesh,
I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.

You understand me: I'm a beast, I know.
But see, now—why, I see as certainly
As that the morning-star's about to shine,
What will hap some day. We've a youngster here
Comes to our convent, studies what I do,
Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:
His name is Guidi—he'll not mind the monks—
They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk—
He picks my practice up—he'll paint apace.
I hope so—though I never live so long,
I know what's sure to follow. You be judge!
You speak no Latin more than I, belike;
However, you're my man, you've seen the world
—The beauty and the wonder and the power,
The shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades,
Changes, surprises,—and God made it all!
—For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or no,
For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,
The mountain round it and the sky above,
Much more the figures of man, woman, child,
These are the frame to? What's it all about?
To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,
Wondered at? oh, this last of course!—you say.
But why not do as well as say,—paint these
Just as they are, careless what comes of it?
God's works—paint any one, and count it crime
To let a truth slip. Don't object, ""His works
Are here already; nature is complete:
Suppose you reproduce her—(which you can't)
There's no advantage! you must beat her, then.""
For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love
First when we see them painted, things we have passed
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
And so they are better, painted—better to us,
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;
God uses us to help each other so,
Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,
Your cullion's hanging face? A bit of chalk,
And trust me but you should, though! How much more,
If I drew higher things with the same truth!
That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,
Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,
It makes me mad to see what men shall do
And we in our graves! This world's no blot for us,
Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:
To find its meaning is my meat and drink.
""Ay, but you don't so instigate to prayer!""
Strikes in the Prior: ""when your meaning's plain
It does not say to folk—remember matins,
Or, mind you fast next Friday!"" Why, for this
What need of art at all? A skull and bones,
Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's best,
A bell to chime the hour with, does as well.
I painted a Saint Laurence six months since
At Prato, splashed the fresco in fine style:
""How looks my painting, now the scaffold's down?""
I ask a brother: ""Hugely,"" he returns—
""Already not one phiz of your three slaves
Who turn the Deacon off his toasted side,
But's scratched and prodded to our heart's content,
The pious people have so eased their own
With coming to say prayers there in a rage:
We get on fast to see the bricks beneath.
Expect another job this time next year,
For pity and religion grow i' the crowd—
Your painting serves its purpose!"" Hang the fools!

—That is—you'll not mistake an idle word
Spoke in a huff by a poor monk, God wot,
Tasting the air this spicy night which turns
The unaccustomed head like Chianti wine!
Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, now!
It's natural a poor monk out of bounds
Should have his apt word to excuse himself:
And hearken how I plot to make amends.
I have bethought me: I shall paint a piece
... There's for you! Give me six months, then go, see
Something in Sant' Ambrogio's! Bless the nuns!
They want a cast o' my office. I shall paint
God in the midst, Madonna and her babe,
Ringed by a bowery, flowery angel-brood,
Lilies and vestments and white faces, sweet
As puff on puff of grated orris-root
When ladies crowd to Church at midsummer.
And then i' the front, of course a saint or two—
Saint John' because he saves the Florentines,
Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and white
The convent's friends and gives them a long day,
And Job, I must have him there past mistake,
The man of Uz (and Us without the z,
Painters who need his patience). Well, all these
Secured at their devotion, up shall come
Out of a corner when you least expect,
As one by a dark stair into a great light,
Music and talking, who but Lippo! I!—
Mazed, motionless, and moonstruck—I'm the man!
Back I shrink—what is this I see and hear?
I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,
My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,
I, in this presence, this pure company!
Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?
Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing
Forward, puts out a soft palm—""Not so fast!""
—Addresses the celestial presence, ""nay—
He made you and devised you, after all,
Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw—
His camel-hair make up a painting brush?
We come to brother Lippo for all that,
Iste perfecit opus! So, all smile—
I shuffle sideways with my blushing face
Under the cover of a hundred wings
Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay
And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,
Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops
The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle off
To some safe bench behind, not letting go
The palm of her, the little lily thing
That spoke the good word for me in the nick,
Like the Prior's niece . . . Saint Lucy, I would say.
And so all's saved for me, and for the church
A pretty picture gained. Go, six months hence!
Your hand, sir, and good-bye: no lights, no lights!
The street's hushed, and I know my own way back,
Don't fear me! There's the grey beginning.

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Abt Vogler,"Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,
   Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,
Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed
   Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,
Man, brute, reptile, fly,—alien of end and of aim,
   Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed,—
Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name,
   And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess he loved!

 Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,
   This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise!
Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and now combine,
   Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise!
And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell,
   Burrow awhile and build, broad on the roots of things,
Then up again swim into sight, having based me my palace well,
   Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs.

 And another would mount and march, like the excellent minion he was,
   Ay, another and yet another, one crowd but with many a crest,
Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,
   Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest:
For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,
   When a great illumination surprises a festal night—
Outlining round and round Rome's dome from space to spire)
   Up, the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my soul was in sight.

 In sight? Not half! for it seemed, it was certain, to match man's birth,
   Nature in turn conceived, obeying an impulse as I;
And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to reach the earth,
   As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale the sky:
Novel splendours burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine,
   Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star;
Meteor-moons, balls of blaze: and they did not pale nor pine,
   For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.

 Nay more; for there wanted not who walked in the glare and glow,
   Presences plain in the place; or, fresh from the Protoplast,
Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,
   Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last;
Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and gone,
   But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new:
What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;
   And what is,—shall I say, matched both? for I was made perfect too.

 All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,
   All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth,
All through music and me! For think, had I painted the whole,
   Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth:
Had I written the same, made verse—still, effect proceeds from cause,
   Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;
It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,
   Painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled:—

 But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,
   Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are!
And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
   That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.
Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is nought;
   It is everywhere in the world—loud, soft, and all is said:
Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought:
   And, there! Ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the head!

 Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;
   Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow;
For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,
   That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.
Never to be again! But many more of the kind
   As good, nay, better, perchance: is this your comfort to me?
To me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind
   To the same, same self, same love, same God: ay, what was, shall be.

 Therefore to whom turn I but to thee, the ineffable Name?
   Builder and maker, thou, of houses not made with hands!
What, have fear of change from thee who art ever the same?
   Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands?
There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;
   The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;
What was good shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;
   On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.

 All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;
   Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power
Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist
   When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.
The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,
   The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,
Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;
   Enough that he heard it once: we shall hear it by and by.

 And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence
   For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized?
Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?
   Why rushed the discords in, but that harmony should be prized?
Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,
   Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:
But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear;
   The rest may reason and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.

 Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:
   I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.
Give me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,
   Sliding by semitones till I sink to the minor,—yes,
And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,
   Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep;
Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Caliban upon Setebos,"""Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself.""
(David, Psalms 50.21)


['Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best,
Flat on his belly in the pit's much mire,
With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin.
And, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,
And feels about his spine small eft-things course,
Run in and out each arm, and make him laugh:
And while above his head a pompion-plant,
Coating the cave-top as a brow its eye,
Creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard,
And now a flower drops with a bee inside,
And now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch,—
He looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams cross
And recross till they weave a spider-web
(Meshes of fire, some great fish breaks at times)
And talks to his own self, howe'er he please,
Touching that other, whom his dam called God.
Because to talk about Him, vexes—ha,
Could He but know! and time to vex is now,
When talk is safer than in winter-time.
Moreover Prosper and Miranda sleep
In confidence he drudges at their task,
And it is good to cheat the pair, and gibe,
Letting the rank tongue blossom into speech.]

Setebos, Setebos, and Setebos!
'Thinketh, He dwelleth i' the cold o' the moon.

'Thinketh He made it, with the sun to match,
But not the stars; the stars came otherwise;
Only made clouds, winds, meteors, such as that:
Also this isle, what lives and grows thereon,
And snaky sea which rounds and ends the same.

'Thinketh, it came of being ill at ease:
He hated that He cannot change His cold,
Nor cure its ache. 'Hath spied an icy fish
That longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she lived,
And thaw herself within the lukewarm brine
O' the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid,
A crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of wave;
Only, she ever sickened, found repulse
At the other kind of water, not her life,
(Green-dense and dim-delicious, bred o' the sun)
Flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe,
And in her old bounds buried her despair,
Hating and loving warmth alike: so He.

'Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this isle,
Trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing.
Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;
Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,
That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown
He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye
By moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue
That pricks deep into oak warts for a worm,
And says a plain word when she finds her prize,
But will not eat the ants; the ants themselves
That build a wall of seeds and settled stalks
About their hole—He made all these and more,
Made all we see, and us, in spite: how else?
He could not, Himself, make a second self
To be His mate; as well have made Himself:
He would not make what He mislikes or slights,
An eyesore to Him, or not worth His pains:
But did, in envy, listlessness or sport,
Make what Himself would fain, in a manner, be—
Weaker in most points, stronger in a few,
Worthy, and yet mere playthings all the while,
Things He admires and mocks too,—that is it.
Because, so brave, so better though they be,
It nothing skills if He begin to plague.
Look, now, I melt a gourd-fruit into mash,
Add honeycomb and pods, I have perceived,
Which bite like finches when they bill and kiss,—
Then, when froth rises bladdery, drink up all,
Quick, quick, till maggots scamper through my brain;
Last, throw me on my back i' the seeded thyme,
And wanton, wishing I were born a bird.
Put case, unable to be what I wish,
I yet could make a live bird out of clay:
Would not I take clay, pinch my Caliban
Able to fly?—for, there, see, he hath wings,
And great comb like the hoopoe's to admire,
And there, a sting to do his foes offence,
There, and I will that he begin to live,
Fly to yon rock-top, nip me off the horns
Of grigs high up that make the merry din,
Saucy through their veined wings, and mind me not.
In which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle clay,
And he lay stupid-like,—why, I should laugh;
And if he, spying me, should fall to weep,
Beseech me to be good, repair his wrong,
Bid his poor leg smart less or grow again,—
Well, as the chance were, this might take or else
Not take my fancy: I might hear his cry,
And give the mankin three sound legs for one,
Or pluck the other off, leave him like an egg
And lessoned he was mine and merely clay.
Were this no pleasure, lying in the thyme,
Drinking the mash, with brain become alive,
Making and marring clay at will? So He.

'Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him,
Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord.
'Am strong myself compared to yonder crabs
That march now from the mountain to the sea;
'Let twenty pass, and stone the twenty-first,
Loving not, hating not, just choosing so.
'Say, the first straggler that boasts purple spots
Shall join the file, one pincer twisted off;
'Say, this bruised fellow shall receive a worm,
And two worms he whose nippers end in red;
As it likes me each time, I do: so He.

Well then, 'supposeth He is good i' the main,
Placable if His mind and ways were guessed,
But rougher than His handiwork, be sure!
Oh, He hath made things worthier than Himself,
And envieth that, so helped, such things do more
Than He who made them! What consoles but this?
That they, unless through Him, do nought at all,
And must submit: what other use in things?
'Hath cut a pipe of pithless elder-joint
That, blown through, gives exact the scream o' the jay
When from her wing you twitch the feathers blue:
Sound this, and little birds that hate the jay
Flock within stone's throw, glad their foe is hurt:
Put case such pipe could prattle and boast forsooth
""I catch the birds, I am the crafty thing,
I make the cry my maker cannot make
With his great round mouth; he must blow through mine!'
Would not I smash it with my foot? So He.

But wherefore rough, why cold and ill at ease?
Aha, that is a question! Ask, for that,
What knows,—the something over Setebos
That made Him, or He, may be, found and fought,
Worsted, drove off and did to nothing, perchance.
There may be something quiet o'er His head,
Out of His reach, that feels nor joy nor grief,
Since both derive from weakness in some way.
I joy because the quails come; would not joy
Could I bring quails here when I have a mind:
This Quiet, all it hath a mind to, doth.
'Esteemeth stars the outposts of its couch,
But never spends much thought nor care that way.
It may look up, work up,—the worse for those
It works on! 'Careth but for Setebos
The many-handed as a cuttle-fish,
Who, making Himself feared through what He does,
Looks up, first, and perceives he cannot soar
To what is quiet and hath happy life;
Next looks down here, and out of very spite
Makes this a bauble-world to ape yon real,
These good things to match those as hips do grapes.
'Tis solace making baubles, ay, and sport.
Himself peeped late, eyed Prosper at his books
Careless and lofty, lord now of the isle:
Vexed, 'stitched a book of broad leaves, arrow-shaped,
Wrote thereon, he knows what, prodigious words;
Has peeled a wand and called it by a name;
Weareth at whiles for an enchanter's robe
The eyed skin of a supple oncelot;
And hath an ounce sleeker than youngling mole,
A four-legged serpent he makes cower and couch,
Now snarl, now hold its breath and mind his eye,
And saith she is Miranda and my wife:
'Keeps for his Ariel a tall pouch-bill crane
He bids go wade for fish and straight disgorge;
Also a sea-beast, lumpish, which he snared,
Blinded the eyes of, and brought somewhat tame,
And split its toe-webs, and now pens the drudge
In a hole o' the rock and calls him Caliban;
A bitter heart that bides its time and bites.
'Plays thus at being Prosper in a way,
Taketh his mirth with make-believes: so He.
His dam held that the Quiet made all things
Which Setebos vexed only: 'holds not so.
Who made them weak, meant weakness He might vex.
Had He meant other, while His hand was in,
Why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick,
Or plate my scalp with bone against the snow,
Or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and joint
Like an orc's armour? Ay,—so spoil His sport!
He is the One now: only He doth all.

'Saith, He may like, perchance, what profits Him.
Ay, himself loves what does him good; but why?
'Gets good no otherwise. This blinded beast
Loves whoso places flesh-meat on his nose,
But, had he eyes, would want no help, but hate
Or love, just as it liked him: He hath eyes.
Also it pleaseth Setebos to work,
Use all His hands, and exercise much craft,
By no means for the love of what is worked.
'Tasteth, himself, no finer good i' the world
When all goes right, in this safe summer-time,
And he wants little, hungers, aches not much,
Than trying what to do with wit and strength.
'Falls to make something: 'piled yon pile of turfs,
And squared and stuck there squares of soft white chalk,
And, with a fish-tooth, scratched a moon on each,
And set up endwise certain spikes of tree,
And crowned the whole with a sloth's skull a-top,
Found dead i' the woods, too hard for one to kill.
No use at all i' the work, for work's sole sake;
'Shall some day knock it down again: so He.

'Saith He is terrible: watch His feats in proof!
One hurricane will spoil six good months' hope.
He hath a spite against me, that I know,
Just as He favours Prosper, who knows why?
So it is, all the same, as well I find.
'Wove wattles half the winter, fenced them firm
With stone and stake to stop she-tortoises
Crawling to lay their eggs here: well, one wave,
Feeling the foot of Him upon its neck,
Gaped as a snake does, lolled out its large tongue,
And licked the whole labour flat: so much for spite.
'Saw a ball flame down late (yonder it lies)
Where, half an hour before, I slept i' the shade:
Often they scatter sparkles: there is force!
'Dug up a newt He may have envied once
And turned to stone, shut up Inside a stone.
Please Him and hinder this?—What Prosper does?
Aha, if He would tell me how! Not He!
There is the sport: discover how or die!
All need not die, for of the things o' the isle
Some flee afar, some dive, some run up trees;
Those at His mercy,—why, they please Him most
When . . . when . . . well, never try the same way twice!
Repeat what act has pleased, He may grow wroth.
You must not know His ways, and play Him off,
Sure of the issue. 'Doth the like himself:
'Spareth a squirrel that it nothing fears
But steals the nut from underneath my thumb,
And when I threat, bites stoutly in defence:
'Spareth an urchin that contrariwise,
Curls up into a ball, pretending death
For fright at my approach: the two ways please.
But what would move my choler more than this,
That either creature counted on its life
To-morrow and next day and all days to come,
Saying, forsooth, in the inmost of its heart,
""Because he did so yesterday with me,
And otherwise with such another brute,
So must he do henceforth and always.""—Ay?
Would teach the reasoning couple what ""must"" means!
'Doth as he likes, or wherefore Lord? So He.

'Conceiveth all things will continue thus,
And we shall have to live in fear of Him
So long as He lives, keeps His strength: no change,
If He have done His best, make no new world
To please Him more, so leave off watching this,—
If He surprise not even the Quiet's self
Some strange day,—or, suppose, grow into it
As grubs grow butterflies: else, here are we,
And there is He, and nowhere help at all.

'Believeth with the life, the pain shall stop.
His dam held different, that after death
He both plagued enemies and feasted friends:
Idly! He doth His worst in this our life,
Giving just respite lest we die through pain,
Saving last pain for worst,—with which, an end.
Meanwhile, the best way to escape His ire
Is, not to seem too happy. 'Sees, himself,
Yonder two flies, with purple films and pink,
Bask on the pompion-bell above: kills both.
'Sees two black painful beetles roll their ball
On head and tail as if to save their lives:
Moves them the stick away they strive to clear.

Even so, 'would have Him misconceive, suppose
This Caliban strives hard and ails no less,
And always, above all else, envies Him;
Wherefore he mainly dances on dark nights,
Moans in the sun, gets under holes to laugh,
And never speaks his mind save housed as now:
Outside, 'groans, curses. If He caught me here,
O'erheard this speech, and asked ""What chucklest at?""
'Would, to appease Him, cut a finger off,
Or of my three kid yearlings burn the best,
Or let the toothsome apples rot on tree,
Or push my tame beast for the orc to taste:
While myself lit a fire, and made a song
And sung it, ""What I hate, be consecrate
To celebrate Thee and Thy state, no mate
For Thee; what see for envy in poor me?""
Hoping the while, since evils sometimes mend,
Warts rub away and sores are cured with slime,
That some strange day, will either the Quiet catch
And conquer Setebos, or likelier He
Decrepit may doze, doze, as good as die.

[What, what? A curtain o'er the world at once!
Crickets stop hissing: not a bird—or, yes,
There scuds His raven that has told Him all!
It was fool's play, this prattling! Ha! The wind
Shoulders the pillared dust, death's house o' the move,
And fast invading fires begin! White blaze—
A tree's head snaps—and there, there, there, there, there,
His thunder follows! Fool to gibe at Him!
Lo! 'Lieth flat and loveth Setebos!
'Maketh his teeth meet through his upper lip,
Will let those quails fly, will not eat this month
One little mess of whelks, so he may 'scape!]",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Living', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Religion', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'Dramatic Monologue', 'Blank Verse', 'Allusion', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43748/caliban-upon-setebos,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-browning,,1812.0,1889.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Robert Browning,1812–1889,Rabbi Ben Ezra,"Grow old along with me! 
The best is yet to be, 
The last of life, for which the first was made: 
Our times are in His hand 
Who saith ""A whole I planned, 
Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!'' 
 
Not that, amassing flowers, 
Youth sighed ""Which rose make ours, 
Which lily leave and then as best recall?"" 
Not that, admiring stars, 
It yearned ""Nor Jove, nor Mars; 
Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all!"" 
 
Not for such hopes and fears 
Annulling youth's brief years, 
Do I remonstrate: folly wide the mark! 
Rather I prize the doubt 
Low kinds exist without, 
Finished and finite clods, untroubled by a spark. 
 
Poor vaunt of life indeed, 
Were man but formed to feed 
On joy, to solely seek and find and feast: 
Such feasting ended, then 
As sure an end to men; 
Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-crammed beast? 
 
Rejoice we are allied 
To That which doth provide 
And not partake, effect and not receive! 
A spark disturbs our clod; 
Nearer we hold of God 
Who gives, than of His tribes that take, I must believe. 
 
Then, welcome each rebuff 
That turns earth's smoothness rough, 
Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go! 
Be our joys three-parts pain! 
Strive, and hold cheap the strain; 
Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe! 
 
For thence,—a paradox 
Which comforts while it mocks,— 
Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail: 
What I aspired to be, 
And was not, comforts me: 
A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale. 
 
What is he but a brute 
Whose flesh has soul to suit, 
Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play? 
To man, propose this test— 
Thy body at its best, 
How far can that project thy soul on its lone way? 
 
Yet gifts should prove their use: 
I own the Past profuse 
Of power each side, perfection every turn: 
Eyes, ears took in their dole, 
Brain treasured up the whole; 
Should not the heart beat once ""How good to live and learn?"" 
 
Not once beat ""Praise be Thine! 
I see the whole design, 
I, who saw power, see now love perfect too: 
Perfect I call Thy plan: 
Thanks that I was a man! 
   Maker, remake, complete,—I trust what Thou shalt do!"" 
 
For pleasant is this flesh; 
Our soul, in its rose-mesh 
Pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for rest; 
Would we some prize might hold 
To match those manifold 
Possessions of the brute,—gain most, as we did best! 
 
Let us not always say, 
""Spite of this flesh to-day 
I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!"" 
As the bird wings and sings, 
Let us cry ""All good things 
Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!"" 
 
Therefore I summon age 
To grant youth's heritage, 
Life's struggle having so far reached its term: 
Thence shall I pass, approved 
A man, for aye removed 
From the developed brute; a god though in the germ. 
 
And I shall thereupon 
Take rest, ere I be gone 
Once more on my adventure brave and new: 
Fearless and unperplexed, 
When I wage battle next, 
What weapons to select, what armour to indue. 
 
Youth ended, I shall try 
My gain or loss thereby; 
Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold: 
And I shall weigh the same, 
Give life its praise or blame: 
Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old. 
 
For note, when evening shuts, 
A certain moment cuts 
The deed off, calls the glory from the grey: 
A whisper from the west 
Shoots—""Add this to the rest, 
Take it and try its worth: here dies another day."" 
 
So, still within this life, 
Though lifted o'er its strife, 
Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last, 
This rage was right i' the main, 
That acquiescence vain: 
The Future I may face now I have proved the Past."" 
 
For more is not reserved 
To man, with soul just nerved 
To act to-morrow what he learns to-day: 
Here, work enough to watch 
The Master work, and catch 
Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play. 
 
As it was better, youth 
Should strive, through acts uncouth, 
Toward making, than repose on aught found made: 
So, better, age, exempt 
From strife, should know, than tempt 
Further. Thou waitedst age: wait death nor be afraid! 
 
Enough now, if the Right 
And Good and Infinite 
Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own 
With knowledge absolute, 
Subject to no dispute 
From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone. 
 
Be there, for once and all, 
Severed great minds from small, 
Announced to each his station in the Past! 
Was I, the world arraigned, 
Were they, my soul disdained, 
Right? Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last! 
 
Now, who shall arbitrate? 
Ten men love what I hate, 
Shun what I follow, slight what I receive; 
Ten, who in ears and eyes 
Match me: we all surmise, 
They this thing, and I that: whom shall my soul believe? 
 
Not on the vulgar mass 
Called ""work,"" must sentence pass, 
Things done, that took the eye and had the price; 
O'er which, from level stand, 
The low world laid its hand, 
Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice: 
 
But all, the world's coarse thumb 
And finger failed to plumb, 
So passed in making up the main account; 
All instincts immature, 
All purposes unsure, 
That weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount: 
 
Thoughts hardly to be packed 
Into a narrow act, 
Fancies that broke through language and escaped; 
All I could never be, 
All, men ignored in me, 
This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped. 
 
Ay, note that Potter's wheel, 
That metaphor! and feel 
Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,— 
Thou, to whom fools propound, 
When the wine makes its round, 
""Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day!"" 
 
Fool! All that is, at all, 
Lasts ever, past recall; 
Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure: 
What entered into thee, 
That was, is, and shall be: 
Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure. 
 
He fixed thee mid this dance 
Of plastic circumstance, 
This Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest: 
Machinery just meant 
To give thy soul its bent, 
Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impressed. 
 
What though the earlier grooves, 
Which ran the laughing loves 
Around thy base, no longer pause and press? 
What though, about thy rim, 
Skull-things in order grim 
Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress? 
 
Look not thou down but up! 
To uses of a cup, 
The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal, 
The new wine's foaming flow, 
The Master's lips a-glow! 
Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel? 
 
But I need, now as then, 
Thee, God, who mouldest men; 
And since, not even while the whirl was worst, 
Did I,—to the wheel of life 
With shapes and colours rife, 
Bound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake Thy thirst: 
 
So, take and use Thy work: 
Amend what flaws may lurk, 
What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim!

Robert Browning,1812–1889,My Last Duchess,"FERRARA

That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not
Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,
The dropping of the daylight in the West,
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
She rode with round the terrace—all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
Or blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked
Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
In speech—which I have not—to make your will
Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—
E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet
The company below, then. I repeat,
The Count your master’s known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretense
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed
At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!",ekphrasis,types/modes,"['Related Audio', 'Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Painting & Sculpture', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Dramatic Monologue', 'Couplet', 'Ekphrasis', 'Persona']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43768/my-last-duchess,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-browning,,1812.0,1889.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Robert Browning,1812–1889,The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church,"Rome, 15—

Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity! 
Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back? 
Nephews—sons mine . . . ah God, I know not! Well— 
She, men would have to be your mother once, 
Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was! 
What's done is done, and she is dead beside, 
Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since, 
And as she died so must we die ourselves, 
And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream. 
Life, how and what is it? As here I lie 
In this state-chamber, dying by degrees, 
Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask 
""Do I live, am I dead?"" Peace, peace seems all. 
Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace; 
And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought 
With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know: 
—Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care; 
Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South 
He graced his carrion with, God curse the same! 
Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence 
One sees the pulpit o' the epistle-side, 
And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats, 
And up into the aery dome where live 
The angels, and a sunbeam's sure to lurk: 
And I shall fill my slab of basalt there, 
And 'neath my tabernacle take my rest, 
With those nine columns round me, two and two, 
The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands: 
Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe 
As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse. 
—Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone, 
Put me where I may look at him! True peach, 
Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize! 
Draw close: that conflagration of my church 
—What then? So much was saved if aught were missed! 
My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig 
The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood, 
Drop water gently till the surface sink, 
And if ye find . . . Ah God, I know not, I! ... 
Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft, 
And corded up in a tight olive-frail, 
Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli, 
Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape, 
Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast ... 
Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all, 
That brave Frascati villa with its bath, 
So, let the blue lump poise between my knees, 
Like God the Father's globe on both His hands 
Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay, 
For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst! 
Swift as a weaver's shuttle fleet our years: 
Man goeth to the grave, and where is he? 
Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black— 
'Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else 
Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath? 
The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me, 
Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance 
Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so, 
The Saviour at his sermon on the mount, 
Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan 
Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off, 
And Moses with the tables . . . but I know 
Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee, 
Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope 
To revel down my villas while I gasp 
Bricked o'er with beggar's mouldy travertine 
Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at! 
Nay, boys, ye love me—all of jasper, then! 
'Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve. 
My bath must needs be left behind, alas! 
One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut, 
There's plenty jasper somewhere in the world— 
And have I not Saint Praxed's ear to pray 
Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts, 
And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs? 
—That's if ye carve my epitaph aright, 
Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word, 
No gaudy ware like Gandolf's second line— 
Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need! 
And then how I shall lie through centuries, 
And hear the blessed mutter of the mass, 
And see God made and eaten all day long, 
And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste 
Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke! 
For as I lie here, hours of the dead night, 
Dying in state and by such slow degrees, 
I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook, 
And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point, 
And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop 
Into great laps and folds of sculptor's-work: 
And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts 
Grow, with a certain humming in my ears, 
About the life before I lived this life, 
And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests, 
Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount, 
Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes, 
And new-found agate urns as fresh as day, 
And marble's language, Latin pure, discreet, 
—Aha, ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend? 
No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best! 
Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage. 
All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope 
My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart? 
Ever your eyes were as a lizard's quick, 
They glitter like your mother's for my soul, 
Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze, 
Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase 
With grapes, and add a vizor and a Term, 
And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx 
That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down, 
To comfort me on my entablature 
Whereon I am to lie till I must ask 
""Do I live, am I dead?"" There, leave me, there! 
For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude 
To death—ye wish it—God, ye wish it! Stone— 
Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat 
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through— 
And no more lapis to delight the world! 
Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there, 
But in a row: and, going, turn your backs 
—Ay, like departing altar-ministrants, 
And leave me in my church, the church for peace, 
That I may watch at leisure if he leers— 
Old Gandolf, at me, from his onion-stone,

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Andrea del Sarto,"But do not let us quarrel any more, 
No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once: 
Sit down and all shall happen as you wish. 
You turn your face, but does it bring your heart? 
I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear, 
Treat his own subject after his own way, 
Fix his own time, accept too his own price, 
And shut the money into this small hand 
When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly? 
Oh, I'll content him,—but to-morrow, Love! 
I often am much wearier than you think, 
This evening more than usual, and it seems 
As if—forgive now—should you let me sit 
Here by the window with your hand in mine 
And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole, 
Both of one mind, as married people use, 
Quietly, quietly the evening through, 
I might get up to-morrow to my work 
Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try. 
To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this! 
Your soft hand is a woman of itself, 
And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. 
Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve 
For each of the five pictures we require: 
It saves a model. So! keep looking so— 
My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds! 
—How could you ever prick those perfect ears, 
Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet— 
My face, my moon, my everybody's moon, 
Which everybody looks on and calls his, 
And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn, 
While she looks—no one's: very dear, no less. 
You smile? why, there's my picture ready made, 
There's what we painters call our harmony! 
A common greyness silvers everything,— 
All in a twilight, you and I alike 
—You, at the point of your first pride in me 
(That's gone you know),—but I, at every point; 
My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down 
To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole. 
There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; 
That length of convent-wall across the way 
Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; 
The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, 
And autumn grows, autumn in everything. 
Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape 
As if I saw alike my work and self 
And all that I was born to be and do, 
A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand. 
How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead; 
So free we seem, so fettered fast we are! 
I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie! 
This chamber for example—turn your head— 
All that's behind us! You don't understand 
Nor care to understand about my art, 
But you can hear at least when people speak: 
And that cartoon, the second from the door 
—It is the thing, Love! so such things should be— 
Behold Madonna!—I am bold to say. 
   I can do with my pencil what I know, 
What I see, what at bottom of my heart 
I wish for, if I ever wish so deep— 
Do easily, too—when I say, perfectly, 
I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, 
Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, 
And just as much they used to say in France. 
At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! 
No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: 
I do what many dream of, all their lives, 
—Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, 
And fail in doing. I could count twenty such 
On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, 
Who strive—you don't know how the others strive 
To paint a little thing like that you smeared 
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat,— 
Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says, 
(I know his name, no matter)—so much less! 
Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. 
There burns a truer light of God in them, 
In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, 
Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt 
This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. 
Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, 
Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, 
Enter and take their place there sure enough, 
Though they come back and cannot tell the world. 
My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. 
The sudden blood of these men! at a word— 
Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. 
I, painting from myself and to myself, 
Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame 
Or their praise either. Somebody remarks 
Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, 
His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, 
Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? 
Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? 
Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, 
Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey, 
Placid and perfect with my art: the worse! 
I know both what I want and what might gain, 
And yet how profitless to know, to sigh 
""Had I been two, another and myself, 
""Our head would have o'erlooked the world!"" No doubt. 
Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth 
The Urbinate who died five years ago. 
('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) 
Well, I can fancy how he did it all, 
Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, 
Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, 
Above and through his art—for it gives way; 
That arm is wrongly put—and there again— 
A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, 
Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, 
He means right—that, a child may understand. 
Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: 
But all the play, the insight and the stretch— 
(Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? 
Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, 
We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! 
Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think— 
More than I merit, yes, by many times. 
But had you—oh, with the same perfect brow, 
And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, 
And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird 
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare — 
Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! 
Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged 
""God and the glory! never care for gain. 
""The present by the future, what is that? 
""Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! 
""Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"" 
I might have done it for you. So it seems: 
Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. 
Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; 
The rest avail not. Why do I need you? 
What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? 
In this world, who can do a thing, will not; 
And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: 
Yet the will's somewhat—somewhat, too, the power— 
And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, 
God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. 
'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, 
That I am something underrated here, 
Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. 
I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, 
For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. 
The best is when they pass and look aside; 
But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. 
Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, 
And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! 
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, 
Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, 
In that humane great monarch's golden look,— 
One finger in his beard or twisted curl 
Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, 
One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, 
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, 
I painting proudly with his breath on me, 
All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, 
Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls 
Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,— 
And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, 
This in the background, waiting on my work, 
To crown the issue with a last reward! 
A good time, was it not, my kingly days? 
And had you not grown restless... but I know— 
'Tis done and past: 'twas right, my instinct said: 
Too live the life grew, golden and not grey, 
And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt 
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. 
How could it end in any other way? 
You called me, and I came home to your heart. 
The triumph was—to reach and stay there; since 
I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? 
Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, 
You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! 
""Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; 
""The Roman's is the better when you pray, 
""But still the other's Virgin was his wife—"" 
Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge 
Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows 
My better fortune, I resolve to think. 
For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, 
Said one day Agnolo, his very self, 
To Rafael . . . I have known it all these years . . . 
(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts 
Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, 
Too lifted up in heart because of it) 
""Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub 
""Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, 
""Who, were he set to plan and execute 
""As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, 
""Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!"" 
To Rafael's!—And indeed the arm is wrong. 
I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see, 
Give the chalk here—quick, thus, the line should go! 
Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! 
Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, 
(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? 
Do you forget already words like those?) 
If really there was such a chance, so lost,— 
Is, whether you're—not grateful—but more pleased. 
Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! 
This hour has been an hour! Another smile? 
If you would sit thus by me every night 
I should work better, do you comprehend? 
I mean that I should earn more, give you more. 
See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; 
Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, 
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. 
Come from the window, love,—come in, at last, 
Inside the melancholy little house 
We built to be so gay with. God is just. 
King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights 
When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, 
The walls become illumined, brick from brick 
Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, 
That gold of his I did cement them with! 
Let us but love each other. Must you go? 
That Cousin here again? he waits outside? 
Must see you—you, and not with me? Those loans? 
More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? 
Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? 
While hand and eye and something of a heart 
Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? 
I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit 
The grey remainder of the evening out, 
Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly 
How I could paint, were I but back in France, 
One picture, just one more—the Virgin's face, 
Not yours this time! I want you at my side 
To hear them—that is, Michel Agnolo— 
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. 
Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend. 
I take the subjects for his corridor, 
Finish the portrait out of hand—there, there, 
And throw him in another thing or two 
If he demurs; the whole should prove enough 
To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, 
What's better and what's all I care about, 
Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! 
Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he, 
The Cousin! what does he to please you more? 
 
I am grown peaceful as old age to-night. 
I regret little, I would change still less. 
Since there my past life lies, why alter it? 
The very wrong to Francis!—it is true 
I took his coin, was tempted and complied, 
And built this house and sinned, and all is said. 
My father and my mother died of want. 
Well, had I riches of my own? you see 
How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot. 
They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died: 
And I have laboured somewhat in my time 
And not been paid profusely. Some good son 
Paint my two hundred pictures—let him try! 
No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes, 
You loved me quite enough. it seems to-night. 
This must suffice me here. What would one have? 
In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance— 
Four great walls in the New Jerusalem, 
Meted on each side by the angel's reed, 
For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me 
To cover—the three first without a wife, 
While I have mine! So—still they overcome 
Because there's still Lucrezia,—as I choose.

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Cleon,"""As certain also of your own poets have said""— 
(Acts 17.28) 


Cleon the poet (from the sprinkled isles, 
Lily on lily, that o'erlace the sea 
And laugh their pride when the light wave lisps ""Greece"")— 
To Protus in his Tyranny: much health! 
 
    They give thy letter to me, even now: 
I read and seem as if I heard thee speak. 
The master of thy galley still unlades 
Gift after gift; they block my court at last 
And pile themselves along its portico 
Royal with sunset, like a thought of thee: 
And one white she-slave from the group dispersed 
Of black and white slaves (like the chequer-work 
Pavement, at once my nation's work and gift, 
Now covered with this settle-down of doves), 
One lyric woman, in her crocus vest 
Woven of sea-wools, with her two white hands 
Commends to me the strainer and the cup 
Thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses mine. 
 
    Well-counselled, king, in thy munificence! 
For so shall men remark, in such an act 
Of love for him whose song gives life its joy,— 
Thy recognition of the use of life; 
Nor call thy spirit barely adequate 
To help on life in straight ways, broad enough 
For vulgar souls, by ruling and the rest. 
Thou, in the daily building of thy tower,— 
Whether in fierce and sudden spasms of toil, 
Or through dim lulls of unapparent growth, 
Or when the general work 'mid good acclaim 
Climbed with the eye to cheer the architect,— 
Didst ne'er engage in work for mere work's sake— 
Hadst ever in thy heart the luring hope 
Of some eventual rest a-top of it, 
Whence, all the tumult of the building hushed, 
Thou first of men might'st look out to the East: 
The vulgar saw thy tower, thou sawest the sun. 
For this, I promise on thy festival 
To pour libation, looking o'er the sea, 
Making this slave narrate thy fortunes, speak 
Thy great words, and describe thy royal face— 
Wishing thee wholly where Zeus lives the most, 
Within the eventual element of calm. 
 
    Thy letter's first requirement meets me here. 
It is as thou hast heard: in one short life 
I, Cleon, have effected all those things 
Thou wonderingly dost enumerate. 
That epos on thy hundred plates of gold 
Is mine,—and also mine the little chant, 
So sure to rise from every fishing-bark 
When, lights at prow, the seamen haul their net. 
The image of the sun-god on the phare, 
Men turn from the sun's self to see, is mine; 
The Pœcile o'er-storied its whole length, 
As thou didst hear, with painting, is mine too. 
I know the true proportions of a man 
And woman also, not observed before; 
And I have written three books on the soul, 
Proving absurd all written hitherto, 
And putting us to ignorance again. 
For music,—why, I have combined the moods, 
Inventing one. In brief, all arts are mine; 
Thus much the people know and recognize, 
Throughout our seventeen islands. Marvel not. 
We of these latter days, with greater mind 
Than our forerunners, since more composite, 
Look not so great, beside their simple way, 
To a judge who only sees one way at once, 
One mind-point and no other at a time,— 
Compares the small part of a man of us 
With some whole man of the heroic age, 
Great in his way—not ours, nor meant for ours. 
And ours is greater, had we skill to know: 
For, what we call this life of men on earth, 
This sequence of the soul's achievements here 
Being, as I find much reason to conceive, 
Intended to be viewed eventually 
As a great whole, not analyzed to parts, 
But each part having reference to all,— 
How shall a certain part, pronounced complete, 
Endure effacement by another part? 
Was the thing done?—then, what's to do again? 
See, in the chequered pavement opposite, 
Suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb, 
And next a lozenge, then a trapezoid— 
He did not overlay them, superimpose 
The new upon the old and blot it out, 
But laid them on a level in his work, 
Making at last a picture; there it lies. 
So, first the perfect separate forms were made, 
The portions of mankind; and after, so, 
Occurred the combination of the same. 
For where had been a progress, otherwise? 
Mankind, made up of all the single men,— 
In such a synthesis the labour ends. 
Now mark me! those divine men of old time 
Have reached, thou sayest well, each at one point 
The outside verge that rounds our faculty; 
And where they reached, who can do more than reach? 
It takes but little water just to touch 
At some one point the inside of a sphere, 
And, as we turn the sphere, touch all the rest 
In due succession: but the finer air 
Which not so palpably nor obviously, 
Though no less universally, can touch 
The whole circumference of that emptied sphere, 
Fills it more fully than the water did; 
Holds thrice the weight of water in itself 
Resolved into a subtler element. 
And yet the vulgar call the sphere first full 
Up to the visible height—and after, void; 
Not knowing air's more hidden properties. 
And thus our soul, misknown, cries out to Zeus 
To vindicate his purpose in our life: 
Why stay we on the earth unless to grow? 
Long since, I imaged, wrote the fiction out, 
That he or other god descended here 
And, once for all, showed simultaneously 
What, in its nature, never can be shown, 
Piecemeal or in succession;—showed, I say, 
The worth both absolute and relative 
Of all his children from the birth of time, 
His instruments for all appointed work. 
I now go on to image,—might we hear 
The judgment which should give the due to each, 
Show where the labour lay and where the ease, 
And prove Zeus' self, the latent everywhere! 
This is a dream:—but no dream, let us hope, 
That years and days, the summers and the springs, 
Follow each other with unwaning powers. 
The grapes which dye thy wine are richer far, 
Through culture, than the wild wealth of the rock; 
The suave plum than the savage-tasted drupe; 
The pastured honey-bee drops choicer sweet; 
The flowers turn double, and the leaves turn flowers; 
That young and tender crescent-moon, thy slave, 
Sleeping above her robe as buoyed by clouds, 
Refines upon the women of my youth. 
What, and the soul alone deteriorates? 
I have not chanted verse like Homer, no— 
Nor swept string like Terpander, no—nor carved 
And painted men like Phidias and his friend: 
I am not great as they are, point by point. 
But I have entered into sympathy 
With these four, running these into one soul, 
Who, separate, ignored each other's art. 
Say, is it nothing that I know them all? 
The wild flower was the larger; I have dashed 
Rose-blood upon its petals, pricked its cup's 
Honey with wine, and driven its seed to fruit, 
And show a better flower if not so large: 
I stand myself. Refer this to the gods 
Whose gift alone it is! which, shall I dare 
(All pride apart) upon the absurd pretext 
That such a gift by chance lay in my hand, 
Discourse of lightly or depreciate? 
It might have fallen to another's hand: what then? 
I pass too surely: let at least truth stay! 
 
    And next, of what thou followest on to ask. 
This being with me as I declare, O king, 
My works, in all these varicoloured kinds, 
So done by me, accepted so by men— 
Thou askest, if (my soul thus in men's hearts) 
I must not be accounted to attain 
The very crown and proper end of life? 
Inquiring thence how, now life closeth up, 
I face death with success in my right hand: 
Whether I fear death less than dost thyself 
The fortunate of men? ""For"" (writest thou) 
""Thou leavest much behind, while I leave nought. 
Thy life stays in the poems men shall sing, 
The pictures men shall study; while my life, 
Complete and whole now in its power and joy, 
Dies altogether with my brain and arm, 
Is lost indeed; since, what survives myself? 
The brazen statue to o'erlook my grave, 
Set on the promontory which I named. 
And that—some supple courtier of my heir 
Shall use its robed and sceptred arm, perhaps, 
To fix the rope to, which best drags it down. 
I go then: triumph thou, who dost not go!"" 
 
    Nay, thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind. 
Is this apparent, when thou turn'st to muse 
Upon the scheme of earth and man in chief, 
That admiration grows as knowledge grows? 
That imperfection means perfection hid, 
Reserved in part, to grace the after-time? 
If, in the morning of philosophy, 
Ere aught had been recorded, nay perceived, 
Thou, with the light now in thee, couldst have looked 
On all earth's tenantry, from worm to bird, 
Ere man, her last, appeared upon the stage— 
Thou wouldst have seen them perfect, and deduced 
The perfectness of others yet unseen. 
Conceding which,—had Zeus then questioned thee, 
""Shall I go on a step, improve on this, 
Do more for visible creatures than is done?"" 
Thou wouldst have answered, ""Ay, by making each 
Grow conscious in himself—by that alone. 
All's perfect else: the shell sucks fast the rock, 
The fish strikes through the sea, the snake both swims 
And slides, forth range the beasts, the birds take flight, 
Till life's mechanics can no further go— 
And all this joy in natural life is put 
Like fire from off thy finger into each, 
So exquisitely perfect is the same. 
But 'tis pure fire, and they mere matter are; 
It has them, not they it: and so I choose 
For man, thy last premeditated work 
(If I might add a glory to the scheme), 
That a third thing should stand apart from both, 
A quality arise within his soul, 
Which, intro-active, made to supervise 
And feel the force it has, may view itself, 
And so be happy."" Man might live at first 
The animal life: but is there nothing more? 
In due time, let him critically learn 
How he lives; and, the more he gets to know 
Of his own life's adaptabilities, 
The more joy-giving will his life become. 
Thus man, who hath this quality, is best. 
 
    But thou, king, hadst more reasonably said: 
""Let progress end at once,—man make no step 
Beyond the natural man, the better beast, 
Using his senses, not the sense of sense."" 
In man there's failure, only since he left 
The lower and inconscious forms of life. 
We called it an advance, the rendering plain 
Man's spirit might grow conscious of man's life, 
And, by new lore so added to the old, 
Take each step higher over the brute's head. 
This grew the only life, the pleasure-house, 
Watch-tower and treasure-fortress of the soul, 
Which whole surrounding flats of natural life 
Seemed only fit to yield subsistence to; 
A tower that crowns a country. But alas, 
The soul now climbs it just to perish there! 
For thence we have discovered ('tis no dream— 
We know this, which we had not else perceived) 
That there's a world of capability 
For joy, spread round about us, meant for us, 
Inviting us; and still the soul craves all, 
And still the flesh replies, ""Take no jot more 
Than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad! 
Nay, so much less as that fatigue has brought 
Deduction to it."" We struggle, fain to enlarge 
Our bounded physical recipiency, 
Increase our power, supply fresh oil to life, 
Repair the waste of age and sickness: no, 
It skills not! life's inadequate to joy, 
As the soul sees joy, tempting life to take. 
They praise a fountain in my garden here 
Wherein a Naiad sends the water-bow 
Thin from her tube; she smiles to see it rise. 
What if I told her, it is just a thread 
From that great river which the hills shut up, 
And mock her with my leave to take the same? 
The artificer has given her one small tube 
Past power to widen or exchange—what boots 
To know she might spout oceans if she could? 
She cannot lift beyond her first thin thread: 
And so a man can use but a man's joy 
While he sees God's. Is it for Zeus to boast, 
""See, man, how happy I live, and despair— 
That I may be still happier—for thy use!"" 
If this were so, we could not thank our lord, 
As hearts beat on to doing; 'tis not so— 
Malice it is not. Is it carelessness? 
Still, no. If care—where is the sign? I ask, 
And get no answer, and agree in sum, 
O king, with thy profound discouragement, 
Who seest the wider but to sigh the more. 
Most progress is most failure: thou sayest well. 
 
    The last point now:—thou dost except a case— 
Holding joy not impossible to one 
With artist-gifts—to such a man as I 
Who leave behind me living works indeed; 
For, such a poem, such a painting lives. 
What? dost thou verily trip upon a word, 
Confound the accurate view of what joy is 
(Caught somewhat clearer by my eyes than thine) 
With feeling joy? confound the knowing how 
And showing how to live (my faculty) 
With actually living?—Otherwise 
Where is the artist's vantage o'er the king? 
Because in my great epos I display 
How divers men young, strong, fair, wise, can act— 
Is this as though I acted? if I paint, 
Carve the young Phoebus, am I therefore young? 
Methinks I'm older that I bowed myself 
The many years of pain that taught me art! 
Indeed, to know is something, and to prove 
How all this beauty might be enjoyed, is more: 
But, knowing nought, to enjoy is something too. 
Yon rower, with the moulded muscles there, 
Lowering the sail, is nearer it than I. 
I can write love-odes: thy fair slave's an ode. 
I get to sing of love, when grown too grey 
For being beloved: she turns to that young man, 
The muscles all a-ripple on his back. 
I know the joy of kingship: well, thou art king! 
 
    ""But,"" sayest thou—(and I marvel, I repeat, 
To find thee trip on such a mere word) ""what 
Thou writest, paintest, stays; that does not die: 
Sappho survives, because we sing her songs, 
And Aeschylus, because we read his plays!"" 
Why, if they live still, let them come and take 
Thy slave in my despite, drink from thy cup, 
Speak in my place. Thou diest while I survive? 
Say rather that my fate is deadlier still, 
In this, that every day my sense of joy 
Grows more acute, my soul (intensified 
By power and insight) more enlarged, more keen; 
While every day my hairs fall more and more, 
My hand shakes, and the heavy years increase— 
The horror quickening still from year to year, 
The consummation coming past escape, 
When I shall know most, and yet least enjoy— 
When all my works wherein I prove my worth, 
Being present still to mock me in men's mouths, 
Alive still, in the praise of such as thou, 
I, I the feeling, thinking, acting man, 
The man who loved his life so over-much, 
Sleep in my urn. It is so horrible, 
I dare at times imagine to my need 
Some future state revealed to us by Zeus, 
Unlimited in capability 
For joy, as this is in desire for joy, 
—To seek which, the joy-hunger forces us: 
That, stung by straitness of our life, made strait 
On purpose to make prized the life at large— 
Freed by the throbbing impulse we call death, 
We burst there as the worm into the fly, 
Who, while a worm still, wants his wings. But no! 
Zeus has not yet revealed it; and alas, 
He must have done so, were it possible! 
 
    Live long and happy, and in that thought die: 
Glad for what was! Farewell. And for the rest, 
I cannot tell thy messenger aright 
Where to deliver what he bears of thine 
To one called Paulus; we have heard his fame 
Indeed, if Christus be not one with him— 
I know not, nor am troubled much to know. 
Thou canst not think a mere barbarian Jew, 
As Paulus proves to be, one circumcised, 
Hath access to a secret shut from us? 
Thou wrongest our philosophy, O king, 
In stooping to inquire of such an one, 
As if his answer could impose at all! 
He writeth, doth he? well, and he may write. 
Oh, the Jew findeth scholars! certain slaves 
Who touched on this same isle, preached him and Christ;

Robert Browning,1812–1889,"An Epistle Containing the Strange Medical Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician","Karshish, the picker-up of learning's crumbs,
The not-incurious in God's handiwork
(This man's-flesh he hath admirably made,
Blown like a bubble, kneaded like a paste,
To coop up and keep down on earth a space
That puff of vapour from his mouth, man's soul)
—To Abib, all-sagacious in our art,
Breeder in me of what poor skill I boast,
Like me inquisitive how pricks and cracks
Befall the flesh through too much stress and strain,
Whereby the wily vapour fain would slip
Back and rejoin its source before the term,—
And aptest in contrivance (under God)
To baffle it by deftly stopping such:—
The vagrant Scholar to his Sage at home
Sends greeting (health and knowledge, fame with peace)
Three samples of true snakestone—rarer still,
One of the other sort, the melon-shaped,
(But fitter, pounded fine, for charms than drugs)
And writeth now the twenty-second time.

My journeyings were brought to Jericho;
Thus I resume. Who studious in our art
Shall count a little labour unrepaid?
I have shed sweat enough, left flesh and bone
On many a flinty furlong of this land.
Also, the country-side is all on fire
With rumours of a marching hitherward:
Some say Vespasian cometh, some, his son.
A black lynx snarled and pricked a tufted ear;
Lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls:
I cried and threw my staff and he was gone.
Twice have the robbers stripped and beaten me,
And once a town declared me for a spy;
But at the end, I reach Jerusalem,
Since this poor covert where I pass the night,
This Bethany, lies scarce the distance thence
A man with plague-sores at the third degree
Runs till he drops down dead. Thou laughest here!
'Sooth, it elates me, thus reposed and safe,
To void the stuffing of my travel-scrip
And share with thee whatever Jewry yields
A viscid choler is observable
In tertians, I was nearly bold to say;
And falling-sickness hath a happier cure
Than our school wots of: there's a spider here
Weaves no web, watches on the ledge of tombs,
Sprinkled with mottles on an ash-grey back;
Take five and drop them . . . but who knows his mind,
The Syrian runagate I trust this to?
His service payeth me a sublimate
Blown up his nose to help the ailing eye.
Best wait: I reach Jerusalem at morn,
There set in order my experiences,
Gather what most deserves, and give thee all—
Or I might add, Judea's gum-tragacanth
Scales off in purer flakes, shines clearer-grained,
Cracks 'twixt the pestle and the porphyry,
In fine exceeds our produce. Scalp-disease
Confounds me, crossing so with leprosy—
Thou hadst admired one sort I gained at Zoar—
But zeal outruns discretion. Here I end.

Yet stay: my Syrian blinketh gratefully,
Protesteth his devotion is my price—
Suppose I write what harms not, though he steal?
I half resolve to tell thee, yet I blush,
What set me off a-writing first of all.
An itch I had, a sting to write, a tang!
For, be it this town's barrenness—or else
The Man had something in the look of him—
His case has struck me far more than 'tis worth.
So, pardon if—(lest presently I lose
In the great press of novelty at hand
The care and pains this somehow stole from me)
I bid thee take the thing while fresh in mind,
Almost in sight—for, wilt thou have the truth?
The very man is gone from me but now,
Whose ailment is the subject of discourse.
Thus then, and let thy better wit help all!

'Tis but a case of mania—subinduced
By epilepsy, at the turning-point
Of trance prolonged unduly some three days:
When, by the exhibition of some drug
Or spell, exorcization, stroke of art
Unknown to me and which 'twere well to know,
The evil thing out-breaking all at once
Left the man whole and sound of body indeed,—
But, flinging (so to speak) life's gates too wide,
Making a clear house of it too suddenly,
The first conceit that entered might inscribe
Whatever it was minded on the wall
So plainly at that vantage, as it were,
(First come, first served) that nothing subsequent
Attaineth to erase those fancy-scrawls
The just-returned and new-established soul
Hath gotten now so thoroughly by heart
That henceforth she will read or these or none.
And first—the man's own firm conviction rests
That he was dead (in fact they buried him)
—That he was dead and then restored to life
By a Nazarene physician of his tribe:
—'Sayeth, the same bade ""Rise,"" and he did rise.
""Such cases are diurnal,"" thou wilt cry.
Not so this figment!—not, that such a fume,
Instead of giving way to time and health,
Should eat itself into the life of life,
As saffron tingeth flesh, blood, bones and all!
For see, how he takes up the after-life.
The man—it is one Lazarus a Jew,
Sanguine, proportioned, fifty years of age,
The body's habit wholly laudable,
As much, indeed, beyond the common health
As he were made and put aside to show.
Think, could we penetrate by any drug
And bathe the wearied soul and worried flesh,
And bring it clear and fair, by three days' sleep!
Whence has the man the balm that brightens all?
This grown man eyes the world now like a child.
Some elders of his tribe, I should premise,
Led in their friend, obedient as a sheep,
To bear my inquisition. While they spoke,
Now sharply, now with sorrow,—told the case,—
He listened not except I spoke to him,
But folded his two hands and let them talk,
Watching the flies that buzzed: and yet no fool.
And that's a sample how his years must go.
Look, if a beggar, in fixed middle-life,
Should find a treasure,—can he use the same
With straitened habits and with tastes starved small,
And take at once to his impoverished brain
The sudden element that changes things,
That sets the undreamed-of rapture at his hand
And puts the cheap old joy in the scorned dust?
Is he not such an one as moves to mirth—
Warily parsimonious, when no need,
Wasteful as drunkenness at undue times?
All prudent counsel as to what befits
The golden mean, is lost on such an one
The man's fantastic will is the man's law.
So here—we call the treasure knowledge, say,
Increased beyond the fleshly faculty—
Heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth,
Earth forced on a soul's use while seeing heaven:
The man is witless of the size, the sum,
The value in proportion of all things,
Or whether it be little or be much.
Discourse to him of prodigious armaments
Assembled to besiege his city now,
And of the passing of a mule with gourds—
'Tis one! Then take it on the other side,
Speak of some trifling fact—he will gaze rapt
With stupor at its very littleness,
(Far as I see) as if in that indeed
He caught prodigious import, whole results;
And so will turn to us the bystanders
In ever the same stupor (note this point)
That we too see not with his opened eyes.
Wonder and doubt come wrongly into play,
Preposterously, at cross purposes.
Should his child sicken unto death,—why, look
For scarce abatement of his cheerfulness,
Or pretermission of the daily craft!
While a word, gesture, glance, from that same child
At play or in the school or laid asleep,
Will startle him to an agony of fear,
Exasperation, just as like. Demand
The reason why—"" tis but a word,"" object—
""A gesture""—he regards thee as our lord
Who lived there in the pyramid alone
Looked at us (dost thou mind?) when, being young,
We both would unadvisedly recite
Some charm's beginning, from that book of his,
Able to bid the sun throb wide and burst
All into stars, as suns grown old are wont.
Thou and the child have each a veil alike
Thrown o'er your heads, from under which ye both
Stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match
Over a mine of Greek fire, did ye know!
He holds on firmly to some thread of life—
(It is the life to lead perforcedly)
Which runs across some vast distracting orb
Of glory on either side that meagre thread,
Which, conscious of, he must not enter yet—
The spiritual life around the earthly life:
The law of that is known to him as this,
His heart and brain move there, his feet stay here.
So is the man perplext with impulses
Sudden to start off crosswise, not straight on,
Proclaiming what is right and wrong across,
And not along, this black thread through the blaze—
""It should be"" baulked by ""here it cannot be.""
And oft the man's soul springs into his face
As if he saw again and heard again
His sage that bade him ""Rise"" and he did rise.
Something, a word, a tick of the blood within
Admonishes: then back he sinks at once
To ashes, who was very fire before,
In sedulous recurrence to his trade
Whereby he earneth him the daily bread;
And studiously the humbler for that pride,
Professedly the faultier that he knows
God's secret, while he holds the thread of life.
Indeed the especial marking of the man
Is prone submission to the heavenly will—
Seeing it, what it is, and why it is.
'Sayeth, he will wait patient to the last
For that same death which must restore his being
To equilibrium, body loosening soul
Divorced even now by premature full growth:
He will live, nay, it pleaseth him to live
So long as God please, and just how God please.
He even seeketh not to please God more
(Which meaneth, otherwise) than as God please.
Hence, I perceive not he affects to preach
The doctrine of his sect whate'er it be,
Make proselytes as madmen thirst to do:
How can he give his neighbour the real ground,
His own conviction? Ardent as he is—
Call his great truth a lie, why, still the old
""Be it as God please"" reassureth him.
I probed the sore as thy disciple should:
""How, beast,"" said I, ""this stolid carelessness
Sufficeth thee, when Rome is on her march
To stamp out like a little spark thy town,
Thy tribe, thy crazy tale and thee at once?""
He merely looked with his large eyes on me.
The man is apathetic, you deduce?
Contrariwise, he loves both old and young,
Able and weak, affects the very brutes
And birds—how say I? flowers of the field—
As a wise workman recognizes tools
In a master's workshop, loving what they make.
Thus is the man as harmless as a lamb:
Only impatient, let him do his best,
At ignorance and carelessness and sin—
An indignation which is promptly curbed:
As when in certain travels I have feigned
To be an ignoramus in our art
According to some preconceived design,
And happed to hear the land's practitioners,
Steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance,
Prattle fantastically on disease,
Its cause and cure—and I must hold my peace!

Thou wilt object—why have I not ere this
Sought out the sage himself, the Nazarene
Who wrought this cure, inquiring at the source,
Conferring with the frankness that befits?
Alas! it grieveth me, the learned leech
Perished in a tumult many years ago,
Accused,—our learning's fate,—of wizardry,
Rebellion, to the setting up a rule
And creed prodigious as described to me.
His death, which happened when the earthquake fell
(Prefiguring, as soon appeared, the loss
To occult learning in our lord the sage
Who lived there in the pyramid alone)
Was wrought by the mad people—that's their wont!
On vain recourse, as I conjecture it,
To his tried virtue, for miraculous help—
How could he stop the earthquake? That's their way!
The other imputations must be lies:
But take one, though I loathe to give it thee,
In mere respect for any good man's fame.
(And after all, our patient Lazarus
Is stark mad; should we count on what he says?
Perhaps not: though in writing to a leech
'Tis well to keep back nothing of a case.)
This man so cured regards the curer, then
As—God forgive me! who but God himself,
Creator and sustainer of the world,
That came and dwelt in flesh on 't awhile!
—'Sayeth that such an one was born and lived,
Taught, healed the sick, broke bread at his own house,
Then died, with Lazarus by, for aught I know,
And yet was . . . what I said nor choose repeat,
And must have so avouched himself, in fact,
In hearing of this very Lazarus
Who saith—but why all this of what he saith?
Why write of trivial matters, things of price
Calling at every moment for remark?
I noticed on the margin of a pool
Blue-flowering borage, the Aleppo sort,
Aboundeth, very nitrous. It is strange!

Thy pardon for this long and tedious case,
Which, now that I review it, needs must seem
Unduly dwelt on, prolixly set forth!
Nor I myself discern in what is writ
Good cause for the peculiar interest
And awe indeed this man has touched me with.
Perhaps the journey's end, the weariness
Had wrought upon me first. I met him thus:
I crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills
Like an old lion's cheek teeth. Out there came
A moon made like a face with certain spots
Multiform, manifold, and menacing:
Then a wind rose behind me. So we met
In this old sleepy town at unaware,
The man and I. I send thee what is writ.
Regard it as a chance, a matter risked
To this ambiguous Syrian—he may lose,
Or steal, or give it thee with equal good.
Jerusalem's repose shall make amends
For time this letter wastes, thy time and mine;
Till when, once more thy pardon and farewell!

The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?
So, the All-Great, were the All-Loving too—
So, through the thunder comes a human voice
Saying, ""O heart I made, a heart beats here!
Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!
Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,
But love I gave thee, with myself to love,
And thou must love me who have died for thee!""

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Fra Lippo Lippi,"[Florentine painter, 1412-69]

I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!
You need not clap your torches to my face.
Zooks, what's to blame? you think you see a monk!
What, 'tis past midnight, and you go the rounds,
And here you catch me at an alley's end
Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar?
The Carmine's my cloister: hunt it up,
Do,—harry out, if you must show your zeal,
Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong hole,
And nip each softling of a wee white mouse,
Weke, weke, that's crept to keep him company!
Aha, you know your betters! Then, you'll take
Your hand away that's fiddling on my throat,
And please to know me likewise. Who am I?
Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a friend
Three streets off—he's a certain . . . how d'ye call?
Master—a ...Cosimo of the Medici,
I' the house that caps the corner. Boh! you were best!
Remember and tell me, the day you're hanged,
How you affected such a gullet's-gripe!
But you, sir, it concerns you that your knaves
Pick up a manner nor discredit you:
Zooks, are we pilchards, that they sweep the streets
And count fair price what comes into their net?
He's Judas to a tittle, that man is!
Just such a face! Why, sir, you make amends.
Lord, I'm not angry! Bid your hang-dogs go
Drink out this quarter-florin to the health
Of the munificent House that harbours me
(And many more beside, lads! more beside!)
And all's come square again. I'd like his face—
His, elbowing on his comrade in the door
With the pike and lantern,—for the slave that holds
John Baptist's head a-dangle by the hair
With one hand (""Look you, now,"" as who should say)
And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!
It's not your chance to have a bit of chalk,
A wood-coal or the like? or you should see!
Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so.
What, brother Lippo's doings, up and down,
You know them and they take you? like enough!
I saw the proper twinkle in your eye—
'Tell you, I liked your looks at very first.
Let's sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch.
Here's spring come, and the nights one makes up bands
To roam the town and sing out carnival,
And I've been three weeks shut within my mew,
A-painting for the great man, saints and saints
And saints again. I could not paint all night—
Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air.
There came a hurry of feet and little feet,
A sweep of lute strings, laughs, and whifts of song, —
Flower o' the broom,
Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!
Flower o' the quince,
I let Lisa go, and what good in life since?
Flower o' the thyme—and so on. Round they went.
Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter
Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight,—three slim shapes,
And a face that looked up . . . zooks, sir, flesh and blood,
That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went,
Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,
All the bed-furniture—a dozen knots,
There was a ladder! Down I let myself,
Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped,
And after them. I came up with the fun
Hard by Saint Laurence, hail fellow, well met,—
Flower o' the rose,
If I've been merry, what matter who knows?
And so as I was stealing back again
To get to bed and have a bit of sleep
Ere I rise up to-morrow and go work
On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast
With his great round stone to subdue the flesh,
You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see!
Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head—
Mine's shaved—a monk, you say—the sting 's in that!
If Master Cosimo announced himself,
Mum's the word naturally; but a monk!
Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now!
I was a baby when my mother died
And father died and left me in the street.
I starved there, God knows how, a year or two
On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks,
Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day,
My stomach being empty as your hat,
The wind doubled me up and down I went.
Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand,
(Its fellow was a stinger as I knew)
And so along the wall, over the bridge,
By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there,
While I stood munching my first bread that month:
""So, boy, you're minded,"" quoth the good fat father
Wiping his own mouth, 'twas refection-time,—
""To quit this very miserable world?
Will you renounce"" . . . ""the mouthful of bread?"" thought I;
By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me;
I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,
Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,
Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici
Have given their hearts to—all at eight years old.
Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,
'Twas not for nothing—the good bellyful,
The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,
And day-long blessed idleness beside!
""Let's see what the urchin's fit for""—that came next.
Not overmuch their way, I must confess.
Such a to-do! They tried me with their books:
Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste!
Flower o' the clove.
All the Latin I construe is, ""amo"" I love!
But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets
Eight years together, as my fortune was,
Watching folk's faces to know who will fling
The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,
And who will curse or kick him for his pains,—
Which gentleman processional and fine,
Holding a candle to the Sacrament,
Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch
The droppings of the wax to sell again,
Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped,—
How say I?—nay, which dog bites, which lets drop
His bone from the heap of offal in the street,—
Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,
He learns the look of things, and none the less
For admonition from the hunger-pinch.
I had a store of such remarks, be sure,
Which, after I found leisure, turned to use.
I drew men's faces on my copy-books,
Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge,
Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,
Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,
And made a string of pictures of the world
Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,
On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black.
""Nay,"" quoth the Prior, ""turn him out, d'ye say?
In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark.
What if at last we get our man of parts,
We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese
And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine
And put the front on it that ought to be!""
And hereupon he bade me daub away.
Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,
Never was such prompt disemburdening.
First, every sort of monk, the black and white,
I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church,
From good old gossips waiting to confess
Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends,—
To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,
Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there
With the little children round him in a row
Of admiration, half for his beard and half
For that white anger of his victim's son
Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,
Signing himself with the other because of Christ
(Whose sad face on the cross sees only this
After the passion of a thousand years)
Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,
(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve
On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,
Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers
(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone.
I painted all, then cried ""'Tis ask and have;
Choose, for more's ready!""—laid the ladder flat,
And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.
The monks closed in a circle and praised loud
Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,
Being simple bodies,—""That's the very man!
Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!
That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes
To care about his asthma: it's the life!''
But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked;
Their betters took their turn to see and say:
The Prior and the learned pulled a face
And stopped all that in no time. ""How? what's here?
Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!
Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true
As much as pea and pea! it's devil's-game!
Your business is not to catch men with show,
With homage to the perishable clay,
But lift them over it, ignore it all,
Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.
Your business is to paint the souls of men—
Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke . . . no, it's not . . .
It's vapour done up like a new-born babe—
(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)
It's . . . well, what matters talking, it's the soul!
Give us no more of body than shows soul!
Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,
That sets us praising—why not stop with him?
Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head
With wonder at lines, colours, and what not?
Paint the soul, never mind the legs and arms!
Rub all out, try at it a second time.
Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,
She's just my niece . . . Herodias, I would say,—
Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!
Have it all out!"" Now, is this sense, I ask?
A fine way to paint soul, by painting body
So ill, the eye can't stop there, must go further
And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white
When what you put for yellow's simply black,
And any sort of meaning looks intense
When all beside itself means and looks nought.
Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,
Left foot and right foot, go a double step,
Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,
Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,
The Prior's niece . . . patron-saint—is it so pretty
You can't discover if it means hope, fear,
Sorrow or joy? won't beauty go with these?
Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,
Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,
And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?
Or say there's beauty with no soul at all—
(I never saw it—put the case the same—)
If you get simple beauty and nought else,
You get about the best thing God invents:
That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,
Within yourself, when you return him thanks.
""Rub all out!"" Well, well, there's my life, in short,
And so the thing has gone on ever since.
I'm grown a man no doubt, I've broken bounds:
You should not take a fellow eight years old
And make him swear to never kiss the girls.
I'm my own master, paint now as I please—
Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!
Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front—
Those great rings serve more purposes than just
To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!
And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes
Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,
The heads shake still—""It's art's decline, my son!
You're not of the true painters, great and old;
Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find;
Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer:
Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!""
Flower o' the pine,
You keep your mistr ... manners, and I'll stick to mine!
I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know!
Don't you think they're the likeliest to know,
They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage,
Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint
To please them—sometimes do and sometimes don't;
For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come
A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints—
A laugh, a cry, the business of the world—
(Flower o' the peach
Death for us all, and his own life for each!)
And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over,
The world and life's too big to pass for a dream,
And I do these wild things in sheer despite,
And play the fooleries you catch me at,
In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass
After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so,
Although the miller does not preach to him
The only good of grass is to make chaff.
What would men have? Do they like grass or no—
May they or mayn't they? all I want's the thing
Settled for ever one way. As it is,
You tell too many lies and hurt yourself:
You don't like what you only like too much,
You do like what, if given you at your word,
You find abundantly detestable.
For me, I think I speak as I was taught;
I always see the garden and God there
A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned,
The value and significance of flesh,
I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.

You understand me: I'm a beast, I know.
But see, now—why, I see as certainly
As that the morning-star's about to shine,
What will hap some day. We've a youngster here
Comes to our convent, studies what I do,
Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:
His name is Guidi—he'll not mind the monks—
They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk—
He picks my practice up—he'll paint apace.
I hope so—though I never live so long,
I know what's sure to follow. You be judge!
You speak no Latin more than I, belike;
However, you're my man, you've seen the world
—The beauty and the wonder and the power,
The shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades,
Changes, surprises,—and God made it all!
—For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or no,
For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,
The mountain round it and the sky above,
Much more the figures of man, woman, child,
These are the frame to? What's it all about?
To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,
Wondered at? oh, this last of course!—you say.
But why not do as well as say,—paint these
Just as they are, careless what comes of it?
God's works—paint any one, and count it crime
To let a truth slip. Don't object, ""His works
Are here already; nature is complete:
Suppose you reproduce her—(which you can't)
There's no advantage! you must beat her, then.""
For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love
First when we see them painted, things we have passed
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
And so they are better, painted—better to us,
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;
God uses us to help each other so,
Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,
Your cullion's hanging face? A bit of chalk,
And trust me but you should, though! How much more,
If I drew higher things with the same truth!
That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,
Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,
It makes me mad to see what men shall do
And we in our graves! This world's no blot for us,
Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:
To find its meaning is my meat and drink.
""Ay, but you don't so instigate to prayer!""
Strikes in the Prior: ""when your meaning's plain
It does not say to folk—remember matins,
Or, mind you fast next Friday!"" Why, for this
What need of art at all? A skull and bones,
Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's best,
A bell to chime the hour with, does as well.
I painted a Saint Laurence six months since
At Prato, splashed the fresco in fine style:
""How looks my painting, now the scaffold's down?""
I ask a brother: ""Hugely,"" he returns—
""Already not one phiz of your three slaves
Who turn the Deacon off his toasted side,
But's scratched and prodded to our heart's content,
The pious people have so eased their own
With coming to say prayers there in a rage:
We get on fast to see the bricks beneath.
Expect another job this time next year,
For pity and religion grow i' the crowd—
Your painting serves its purpose!"" Hang the fools!

—That is—you'll not mistake an idle word
Spoke in a huff by a poor monk, God wot,
Tasting the air this spicy night which turns
The unaccustomed head like Chianti wine!
Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, now!
It's natural a poor monk out of bounds
Should have his apt word to excuse himself:
And hearken how I plot to make amends.
I have bethought me: I shall paint a piece
... There's for you! Give me six months, then go, see
Something in Sant' Ambrogio's! Bless the nuns!
They want a cast o' my office. I shall paint
God in the midst, Madonna and her babe,
Ringed by a bowery, flowery angel-brood,
Lilies and vestments and white faces, sweet
As puff on puff of grated orris-root
When ladies crowd to Church at midsummer.
And then i' the front, of course a saint or two—
Saint John' because he saves the Florentines,
Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and white
The convent's friends and gives them a long day,
And Job, I must have him there past mistake,
The man of Uz (and Us without the z,
Painters who need his patience). Well, all these
Secured at their devotion, up shall come
Out of a corner when you least expect,
As one by a dark stair into a great light,
Music and talking, who but Lippo! I!—
Mazed, motionless, and moonstruck—I'm the man!
Back I shrink—what is this I see and hear?
I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,
My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,
I, in this presence, this pure company!
Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?
Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing
Forward, puts out a soft palm—""Not so fast!""
—Addresses the celestial presence, ""nay—
He made you and devised you, after all,
Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw—
His camel-hair make up a painting brush?
We come to brother Lippo for all that,
Iste perfecit opus! So, all smile—
I shuffle sideways with my blushing face
Under the cover of a hundred wings
Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay
And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,
Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops
The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle off
To some safe bench behind, not letting go
The palm of her, the little lily thing
That spoke the good word for me in the nick,
Like the Prior's niece . . . Saint Lucy, I would say.
And so all's saved for me, and for the church
A pretty picture gained. Go, six months hence!
Your hand, sir, and good-bye: no lights, no lights!
The street's hushed, and I know my own way back,
Don't fear me! There's the grey beginning.

Robert Browning,1812–1889,Caliban upon Setebos,"""Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself.""
(David, Psalms 50.21)


['Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best,
Flat on his belly in the pit's much mire,
With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin.
And, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,
And feels about his spine small eft-things course,
Run in and out each arm, and make him laugh:
And while above his head a pompion-plant,
Coating the cave-top as a brow its eye,
Creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard,
And now a flower drops with a bee inside,
And now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch,—
He looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams cross
And recross till they weave a spider-web
(Meshes of fire, some great fish breaks at times)
And talks to his own self, howe'er he please,
Touching that other, whom his dam called God.
Because to talk about Him, vexes—ha,
Could He but know! and time to vex is now,
When talk is safer than in winter-time.
Moreover Prosper and Miranda sleep
In confidence he drudges at their task,
And it is good to cheat the pair, and gibe,
Letting the rank tongue blossom into speech.]

Setebos, Setebos, and Setebos!
'Thinketh, He dwelleth i' the cold o' the moon.

'Thinketh He made it, with the sun to match,
But not the stars; the stars came otherwise;
Only made clouds, winds, meteors, such as that:
Also this isle, what lives and grows thereon,
And snaky sea which rounds and ends the same.

'Thinketh, it came of being ill at ease:
He hated that He cannot change His cold,
Nor cure its ache. 'Hath spied an icy fish
That longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she lived,
And thaw herself within the lukewarm brine
O' the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid,
A crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of wave;
Only, she ever sickened, found repulse
At the other kind of water, not her life,
(Green-dense and dim-delicious, bred o' the sun)
Flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe,
And in her old bounds buried her despair,
Hating and loving warmth alike: so He.

'Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this isle,
Trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing.
Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;
Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,
That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown
He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye
By moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue
That pricks deep into oak warts for a worm,
And says a plain word when she finds her prize,
But will not eat the ants; the ants themselves
That build a wall of seeds and settled stalks
About their hole—He made all these and more,
Made all we see, and us, in spite: how else?
He could not, Himself, make a second self
To be His mate; as well have made Himself:
He would not make what He mislikes or slights,
An eyesore to Him, or not worth His pains:
But did, in envy, listlessness or sport,
Make what Himself would fain, in a manner, be—
Weaker in most points, stronger in a few,
Worthy, and yet mere playthings all the while,
Things He admires and mocks too,—that is it.
Because, so brave, so better though they be,
It nothing skills if He begin to plague.
Look, now, I melt a gourd-fruit into mash,
Add honeycomb and pods, I have perceived,
Which bite like finches when they bill and kiss,—
Then, when froth rises bladdery, drink up all,
Quick, quick, till maggots scamper through my brain;
Last, throw me on my back i' the seeded thyme,
And wanton, wishing I were born a bird.
Put case, unable to be what I wish,
I yet could make a live bird out of clay:
Would not I take clay, pinch my Caliban
Able to fly?—for, there, see, he hath wings,
And great comb like the hoopoe's to admire,
And there, a sting to do his foes offence,
There, and I will that he begin to live,
Fly to yon rock-top, nip me off the horns
Of grigs high up that make the merry din,
Saucy through their veined wings, and mind me not.
In which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle clay,
And he lay stupid-like,—why, I should laugh;
And if he, spying me, should fall to weep,
Beseech me to be good, repair his wrong,
Bid his poor leg smart less or grow again,—
Well, as the chance were, this might take or else
Not take my fancy: I might hear his cry,
And give the mankin three sound legs for one,
Or pluck the other off, leave him like an egg
And lessoned he was mine and merely clay.
Were this no pleasure, lying in the thyme,
Drinking the mash, with brain become alive,
Making and marring clay at will? So He.

'Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him,
Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord.
'Am strong myself compared to yonder crabs
That march now from the mountain to the sea;
'Let twenty pass, and stone the twenty-first,
Loving not, hating not, just choosing so.
'Say, the first straggler that boasts purple spots
Shall join the file, one pincer twisted off;
'Say, this bruised fellow shall receive a worm,
And two worms he whose nippers end in red;
As it likes me each time, I do: so He.

Well then, 'supposeth He is good i' the main,
Placable if His mind and ways were guessed,
But rougher than His handiwork, be sure!
Oh, He hath made things worthier than Himself,
And envieth that, so helped, such things do more
Than He who made them! What consoles but this?
That they, unless through Him, do nought at all,
And must submit: what other use in things?
'Hath cut a pipe of pithless elder-joint
That, blown through, gives exact the scream o' the jay
When from her wing you twitch the feathers blue:
Sound this, and little birds that hate the jay
Flock within stone's throw, glad their foe is hurt:
Put case such pipe could prattle and boast forsooth
""I catch the birds, I am the crafty thing,
I make the cry my maker cannot make
With his great round mouth; he must blow through mine!'
Would not I smash it with my foot? So He.

But wherefore rough, why cold and ill at ease?
Aha, that is a question! Ask, for that,
What knows,—the something over Setebos
That made Him, or He, may be, found and fought,
Worsted, drove off and did to nothing, perchance.
There may be something quiet o'er His head,
Out of His reach, that feels nor joy nor grief,
Since both derive from weakness in some way.
I joy because the quails come; would not joy
Could I bring quails here when I have a mind:
This Quiet, all it hath a mind to, doth.
'Esteemeth stars the outposts of its couch,
But never spends much thought nor care that way.
It may look up, work up,—the worse for those
It works on! 'Careth but for Setebos
The many-handed as a cuttle-fish,
Who, making Himself feared through what He does,
Looks up, first, and perceives he cannot soar
To what is quiet and hath happy life;
Next looks down here, and out of very spite
Makes this a bauble-world to ape yon real,
These good things to match those as hips do grapes.
'Tis solace making baubles, ay, and sport.
Himself peeped late, eyed Prosper at his books
Careless and lofty, lord now of the isle:
Vexed, 'stitched a book of broad leaves, arrow-shaped,
Wrote thereon, he knows what, prodigious words;
Has peeled a wand and called it by a name;
Weareth at whiles for an enchanter's robe
The eyed skin of a supple oncelot;
And hath an ounce sleeker than youngling mole,
A four-legged serpent he makes cower and couch,
Now snarl, now hold its breath and mind his eye,
And saith she is Miranda and my wife:
'Keeps for his Ariel a tall pouch-bill crane
He bids go wade for fish and straight disgorge;
Also a sea-beast, lumpish, which he snared,
Blinded the eyes of, and brought somewhat tame,
And split its toe-webs, and now pens the drudge
In a hole o' the rock and calls him Caliban;
A bitter heart that bides its time and bites.
'Plays thus at being Prosper in a way,
Taketh his mirth with make-believes: so He.
His dam held that the Quiet made all things
Which Setebos vexed only: 'holds not so.
Who made them weak, meant weakness He might vex.
Had He meant other, while His hand was in,
Why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick,
Or plate my scalp with bone against the snow,
Or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and joint
Like an orc's armour? Ay,—so spoil His sport!
He is the One now: only He doth all.

'Saith, He may like, perchance, what profits Him.
Ay, himself loves what does him good; but why?
'Gets good no otherwise. This blinded beast
Loves whoso places flesh-meat on his nose,
But, had he eyes, would want no help, but hate
Or love, just as it liked him: He hath eyes.
Also it pleaseth Setebos to work,
Use all His hands, and exercise much craft,
By no means for the love of what is worked.
'Tasteth, himself, no finer good i' the world
When all goes right, in this safe summer-time,
And he wants little, hungers, aches not much,
Than trying what to do with wit and strength.
'Falls to make something: 'piled yon pile of turfs,
And squared and stuck there squares of soft white chalk,
And, with a fish-tooth, scratched a moon on each,
And set up endwise certain spikes of tree,
And crowned the whole with a sloth's skull a-top,
Found dead i' the woods, too hard for one to kill.
No use at all i' the work, for work's sole sake;
'Shall some day knock it down again: so He.

'Saith He is terrible: watch His feats in proof!
One hurricane will spoil six good months' hope.
He hath a spite against me, that I know,
Just as He favours Prosper, who knows why?
So it is, all the same, as well I find.
'Wove wattles half the winter, fenced them firm
With stone and stake to stop she-tortoises
Crawling to lay their eggs here: well, one wave,
Feeling the foot of Him upon its neck,
Gaped as a snake does, lolled out its large tongue,
And licked the whole labour flat: so much for spite.
'Saw a ball flame down late (yonder it lies)
Where, half an hour before, I slept i' the shade:
Often they scatter sparkles: there is force!
'Dug up a newt He may have envied once
And turned to stone, shut up Inside a stone.
Please Him and hinder this?—What Prosper does?
Aha, if He would tell me how! Not He!
There is the sport: discover how or die!
All need not die, for of the things o' the isle
Some flee afar, some dive, some run up trees;
Those at His mercy,—why, they please Him most
When . . . when . . . well, never try the same way twice!
Repeat what act has pleased, He may grow wroth.
You must not know His ways, and play Him off,
Sure of the issue. 'Doth the like himself:
'Spareth a squirrel that it nothing fears
But steals the nut from underneath my thumb,
And when I threat, bites stoutly in defence:
'Spareth an urchin that contrariwise,
Curls up into a ball, pretending death
For fright at my approach: the two ways please.
But what would move my choler more than this,
That either creature counted on its life
To-morrow and next day and all days to come,
Saying, forsooth, in the inmost of its heart,
""Because he did so yesterday with me,
And otherwise with such another brute,
So must he do henceforth and always.""—Ay?
Would teach the reasoning couple what ""must"" means!
'Doth as he likes, or wherefore Lord? So He.

'Conceiveth all things will continue thus,
And we shall have to live in fear of Him
So long as He lives, keeps His strength: no change,
If He have done His best, make no new world
To please Him more, so leave off watching this,—
If He surprise not even the Quiet's self
Some strange day,—or, suppose, grow into it
As grubs grow butterflies: else, here are we,
And there is He, and nowhere help at all.

'Believeth with the life, the pain shall stop.
His dam held different, that after death
He both plagued enemies and feasted friends:
Idly! He doth His worst in this our life,
Giving just respite lest we die through pain,
Saving last pain for worst,—with which, an end.
Meanwhile, the best way to escape His ire
Is, not to seem too happy. 'Sees, himself,
Yonder two flies, with purple films and pink,
Bask on the pompion-bell above: kills both.
'Sees two black painful beetles roll their ball
On head and tail as if to save their lives:
Moves them the stick away they strive to clear.

Even so, 'would have Him misconceive, suppose
This Caliban strives hard and ails no less,
And always, above all else, envies Him;
Wherefore he mainly dances on dark nights,
Moans in the sun, gets under holes to laugh,
And never speaks his mind save housed as now:
Outside, 'groans, curses. If He caught me here,
O'erheard this speech, and asked ""What chucklest at?""
'Would, to appease Him, cut a finger off,
Or of my three kid yearlings burn the best,
Or let the toothsome apples rot on tree,
Or push my tame beast for the orc to taste:
While myself lit a fire, and made a song
And sung it, ""What I hate, be consecrate
To celebrate Thee and Thy state, no mate
For Thee; what see for envy in poor me?""
Hoping the while, since evils sometimes mend,
Warts rub away and sores are cured with slime,
That some strange day, will either the Quiet catch
And conquer Setebos, or likelier He
Decrepit may doze, doze, as good as die.

[What, what? A curtain o'er the world at once!
Crickets stop hissing: not a bird—or, yes,
There scuds His raven that has told Him all!
It was fool's play, this prattling! Ha! The wind
Shoulders the pillared dust, death's house o' the move,
And fast invading fires begin! White blaze—
A tree's head snaps—and there, there, there, there, there,
His thunder follows! Fool to gibe at Him!
Lo! 'Lieth flat and loveth Setebos!
'Maketh his teeth meet through his upper lip,
Will let those quails fly, will not eat this month
One little mess of whelks, so he may 'scape!]",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Religion', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'Dramatic Monologue', 'Blank Verse', 'Allusion', 'Imagery']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43748/caliban-upon-setebos,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-browning,,1812.0,1889.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Robert Browning,1812–1889,A Death in the Desert,"[Supposed of Pamphylax the Antiochene: 
It is a parchment, of my rolls the fifth, 
Hath three skins glued together, is all Greek, 
And goeth from Epsilon down to Mu: 
Lies second in the surnamed Chosen Chest, 
Stained and conserved with juice of terebinth, 
Covered with cloth of hair, and lettered Xi, 
From Xanthus, my wife's uncle, now at peace: 
Mu and Epsilon stand for my own name. 
I may not write it, but I make a cross 
To show I wait His coming, with the rest, 
And leave off here: beginneth Pamphylax.] 
 
I said, ""If one should wet his lips with wine, 
""And slip the broadest plantain-leaf we find, 
""Or else the lappet of a linen robe, 
""Into the water-vessel, lay it right, 
""And cool his forehead just above the eyes, 
""The while a brother, kneeling either side, 
""Should chafe each hand and try to make it warm,— 
""He is not so far gone but he might speak."" 
 
This did not happen in the outer cave, 
Nor in the secret chamber of the rock 
Where, sixty days since the decree was out, 
We had him, bedded on a camel-skin, 
And waited for his dying all the while; 
But in the midmost grotto: since noon's light 
Reached there a little, and we would not lose 
The last of what might happen on his face. 
I at the head, and Xanthus at the feet, 
With Valens and the Boy, had lifted him, 
And brought him from the chamber in the depths, 
And laid him in the light where we might see: 
For certain smiles began about his mouth, 
And his lids moved, presageful of the end. 
 
Beyond, and half way up the mouth o' the cave 
The Bactrian convert, having his desire, 
Kept watch, and made pretence to graze a goat 
That gave us milk, on rags of various herb, 
Plantain and quitch, the rocks' shade keeps alive: 
So that if any thief or soldier passed 
(Because the persecution was aware, 
Yielding the goat up promptly with his life, 
Such man might pass on, joyful at a prize, 
Nor care to pry into the cool o' the cave. 
Outside was all noon and the burning blue. 
 
""Here is wine,"" answered Xanthus,—dropped a drop; 
I stooped and placed the lap of cloth aright, 
Then chafed his right hand, and the Boy his left: 
But Valens had bethought him, and produced 
And broke a ball of nard, and made perfume. 
Only, he did—not so much wake, as—turn 
And smile a little, as a sleeper does 
If any dear one call him, touch his face— 
And smiles and loves, but will not be disturbed. 
 
Then Xanthus said a prayer, but still he slept: 
It is the Xanthus that escaped to Rome, 
Was burned, and could not write the chronicle. 
 
Then the Boy sprang up from his knees, and ran, 
Stung by the splendour of a sudden thought, 
And fetched the seventh plate of graven lead 
Out of the secret chamber, found a place, 
Pressing with finger on the deeper dints, 
And spoke, as 'twere his mouth proclaiming first, 
""I am the Resurrection and the Life."" 
 
Whereat he opened his eyes wide at once, 
And sat up of himself, and looked at us; 
And thenceforth nobody pronounced a word: 
Only, outside, the Bactrian cried his cry 
Like the lone desert-bird that wears the ruff, 
As signal we were safe, from time to time. 
 
First he said, ""If a friend declared to me, 
""This my son Valens, this my other son, 
""Were James and Peter,—nay, declared as well 
""This lad was very John,—I could believe! 
""—Could, for a moment, doubtlessly believe: 
""So is myself withdrawn into my depths, 
""The soul retreated from the perished brain 
""Whence it was wont to feel and use the world 
""Through these dull members, done with long ago. 
""Yet I myself remain; I feel myself: 
""And there is nothing lost. Let be, awhile!"" 
 
[This is the doctrine he was wont to teach, 
How divers persons witness in each man, 
Three souls which make up one soul: first, to wit, 
A soul of each and all the bodily parts, 
Seated therein, which works, and is what Does, 
And has the use of earth, and ends the man 
Downward: but, tending upward for advice, 
Grows into, and again is grown into 
By the next soul, which, seated in the brain, 
Useth the first with its collected use, 
And feeleth, thinketh, willeth,—is what Knows: 
Which, duly tending upward in its turn, 
Grows into, and again is grown into 
By the last soul, that uses both the first, 
Subsisting whether they assist or no, 
And, constituting man's self, is what Is— 
And leans upon the former, makes it play, 
As that played off the first: and, tending up, 
Holds, is upheld by, God, and ends the man 
Upward in that dread point of intercourse, 
Nor needs a place, for it returns to Him. 
What Does, what Knows, what Is; three souls, one man. 
I give the glossa of Theotypas.] 
 
And then, ""A stick, once fire from end to end; 
""Now, ashes save the tip that holds a spark! 
""Yet, blow the spark, it runs back, spreads itself 
""A little where the fire was: thus I urge 
""The soul that served me, till it task once more 
""What ashes of my brain have kept their shape, 
""And these make effort on the last o' the flesh, 
""Trying to taste again the truth of things—"" 
(He smiled)—""their very superficial truth; 
""As that ye are my sons, that it is long 
""Since James and Peter had release by death, 
""And I am only he, your brother John, 
""Who saw and heard, and could remember all. 
""Remember all! It is not much to say. 
""What if the truth broke on me from above 
""As once and oft-times? Such might hap again: 
""Doubtlessly He might stand in presence here, 
""With head wool-white, eyes flame, and feet like brass, 
""The sword and the seven stars, as I have seen— 
""I who now shudder only and surmise 
""How did your brother bear that sight and live?' 
 
""If I live yet, it is for good, more love 
""Through me to men: be nought but ashes here 
""That keep awhile my semblance, who was John,— 
""Still, when they scatter, there is left on earth 
""No one alive who knew (consider this!) 
""—Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands 
""That which was from the first, the Word of Life. 
""How will it be when none more saith 'I saw'? 
 
""Such ever was love's way: to rise, it stoops. 
""Since I, whom Christ's mouth taught, was bidden teach, 
""I went, for many years, about the world, 
""Saying 'It was so; so I heard and saw,' 
""Speaking as the case asked: and men believed. 
""Afterward came the message to myself 
""In Patmos isle; I was not bidden teach, 
""But simply listen, take a book and write, 
""Nor set down other than the given word, 
""With nothing left to my arbitrament 
""To choose or change: I wrote, and men believed. 
""Then, for my time grew brief, no message more, 
""No call to write again, I found a way, 
""And, reasoning from my knowledge, merely taught 
""Men should, for love's sake, in love's strength believe; 
""Or I would pen a letter to a friend 
""And urge the same as friend, nor less nor more: 
""Friends said I reasoned rightly, and believed. 
""But at the last, why, I seemed left alive 
""Like a sea jelly weak on Patmos strand, 
""To tell dry sea-beach gazers how I fared 
""When there was mid-sea, and the mighty things; 
""Left to repeat, 'I saw, I heard, I knew,' 
""And go all over the old ground again, 
""With Antichrist already in the world, 
""And many Antichrists, who answered prompt 
"" Am I not Jasper as thyself art John? 
"" Nay, young, whereas through age thou mayest forget; 
"" Wherefore, explain, or how shall we believe? 
""I never thought to call down fire on such, 
""Or, as in wonderful and early days, 
""Pick up the scorpion, tread the serpent dumb; 
""But patient stated much of the Lord's life 
""Forgotten or misdelivered, and let it work: 
""Since much that at the first, in deed and word, 
""Lay simply and sufficiently exposed, 
""Had grown (or else my soul was grown to match, 
""Fed through such years, familiar with such light, 
""Guarded and guided still to see and speak) 
""Of new significance and fresh result; 
""What first were guessed as points, I now knew stars, 
""And named them in the Gospel I have writ. 
""For men said, 'It is getting long ago: 
"" Where is the promise of His coming?'—asked 
""These young ones in their strength, as loth to wait, 
""Of me who, when their sires were born, was old. 
""I, for I loved them, answered, joyfully, 
""Since I was there, and helpful in my age; 
""And, in the main, I think such men believed. 
""Finally, thus endeavouring, I fell sick, 
""Ye brought me here, and I supposed the end, 
""And went to sleep with one thought that, at least, 
""Though the whole earth should lie in wickedness, 
""We had the truth, might leave the rest to God. 
""Yet now I wake in such decrepitude 
""As I had slidden down and fallen afar, 
""Past even the presence of my former self, 
""Grasping the while for stay at facts which snap, 
""Till I am found away from my own world, 
Feeling for foot-hold through a blank profound, 
""Along with unborn people in strange lands, 
""Who say—I hear said or conceive they say— 
"" Was John at all, and did he say he saw? 
"" Assure us, ere we ask what he might see!' 
 
""And how shall I assure them? Can they share 
""—They, who have flesh, a veil of youth and strength 
""About each spirit, that needs must bide its time, 
""Living and learning still as years assist 
""Which wear the thickness thin, and let man see— 
""With me who hardly am withheld at all, 
""But shudderingly, scarce a shred between, 
""Lie bare to the universal prick of light? 
""Is it for nothing we grow old and weak, 
""We whom God loves? When pain ends, gain ends too. 
""To me, that story—ay, that Life and Death 
""Of which I wrote 'it was'—to me, it is; 
""—Is, here and now: I apprehend nought else. 
Is not God now i' the world His power first made? 
""Is not His love at issue still with sin, 
""Visibly when a wrong is done on earth? 
""Love, wrong, and pain, what see I else around? 
""Yea, and the Resurrection and Uprise 
""To the right hand of the throne—what is it beside, 
""When such truth, breaking bounds, o'erfloods my soul, 
And, as I saw the sin and death, even so 
""See I the need yet transiency of both, 
""The good and glory consummated thence? 
""I saw the power; I see the Love, once weak, 
""Resume the Power: and in this word 'I see,' 
""Lo, there is recognized the Spirit of both 
""That moving o'er the spirit of man, unblinds 
""His eye and bids him look. These are, I see; 
""But ye, the children, His beloved ones too, 
""Ye need,—as I should use an optic glass 
I wondered at erewhile, somewhere i' the world, 
""It had been given a crafty smith to make; 
""A tube, he turned on objects brought too close, 
Lying confusedly insubordinate 
""For the unassisted eye to master once: 
""Look through his tube, at distance now they lay, 
""Become succinct, distinct, so small, so clear! 
""Just thus, ye needs must apprehend what truth 
""I see, reduced to plain historic fact, 
""Diminished into clearness, proved a point 
""And far away: ye would withdraw your sense 
From out eternity, strain it upon time, 
""Then stand before that fact, that Life and Death, 
""Stay there at gaze, till it dispart, dispread, 
As though a star should open out, all sides, 
Grow the world on you, as it is my world. 
 
""For life, with all it yields of joy and woe 
""And hope and fear,—believe the aged friend,— 
Is just our chance o' the prize of learning love, 
""How love might be, hath been indeed, and is; 
""And that we hold thenceforth to the uttermost 
""Such prize despite the envy of the world, 
And, having gained truth, keep truth: that is all. 
""But see the double way wherein we are led, 
""How the soul learns diversely from the flesh! 
""With flesh, that hath so little time to stay, 
""And yields mere basement for the soul's emprise, 
""Expect prompt teaching. Helpful was the light, 
""And warmth was cherishing and food was choice 
""To every man's flesh, thousand years ago, 
""As now to yours and mine; the body sprang 
""At once to the height, and stayed: but the soul,—no! 
""Since sages who, this noontide, meditate 
""In Rome or Athens, may descry some point 
""Of the eternal power, hid yestereve; 
""And, as thereby the power's whole mass extends, 
""So much extends the æther floating o'er, 
""The love that tops the might, the Christ in God. 
""Then, as new lessons shall be learned in these 
""Till earth's work stop and useless time run out, 
""So duly, daily, needs provision be 
""For keeping the soul's prowess possible, 
""Building new barriers as the old decay, 
""Saving us from evasion of life's proof, 
""Putting the question ever, 'Does God love, 
"" And will ye hold that truth against the world?' 
""Ye know there needs no second proof with good 
""Gained for our flesh from any earthly source: 
""We might go freezing, ages,—give us fire, 
""Thereafter we judge fire at its full worth, 
""And guard it safe through every chance, ye know! 
""That fable of Prometheus and his theft, 
""How mortals gained Jove's fiery flower, grows old 
""(I have been used to hear the pagans own) 
""And out of mind; but fire, howe'er its birth, 
""Here is it, precious to the sophist now 
""Who laughs the myth of Æschylus to scorn, 
""As precious to those satyrs of his play, 
""Who touched it in gay wonder at the thing. 
""While were it so with the soul,—this gift of truth 
""Once grasped, were this our soul's gain safe, and sure 
""To prosper as the body's gain is wont,— 
""Why, man's probation would conclude, his earth 
""Crumble; for he both reasons and decides, 
""Weighs first, then chooses: will he give up fire 
""For gold or purple once he knows its worth? 
""Could he give Christ up were His worth as plain? 
""Therefore, I say, to test man, the proofs shift, 
""Nor may he grasp that fact like other fact, 
""And straightway in his life acknowledge it, 
""As, say, the indubitable bliss of fire. 
""Sigh ye, 'It had been easier once than now'? 
""To give you answer I am left alive; 
""Look at me who was present from the first! 
""Ye know what things I saw; then came a test, 
""My first, befitting me who so had seen: 
"" Forsake the Christ thou sawest transfigured, Him 
"" Who trod the sea and brought the dead to life? 
"" What should wring this from thee!'—ye laugh and ask. 
""What wrung it? Even a torchlight and a noise, 
""The sudden Roman faces, violent hands, 
""And fear of what the Jews might do! Just that, 
""And it is written, 'I forsook and fled': 
""There was my trial, and it ended thus. 
""Ay, but my soul had gained its truth, could grow: 
""Another year or two,—what little child, 
""What tender woman that had seen no least 
""Of all my sights, but barely heard them told, 
""Who did not clasp the cross with a light laugh, 
""Or wrap the burning robe round, thanking God? 
""Well, was truth safe for ever, then? Not so. 
""Already had begun the silent work 
""Whereby truth, deadened of its absolute blaze, 
""Might need love's eye to pierce the o'erstretched doubt. 
""Teachers were busy, whispering 'All is true 
"" As the aged ones report; but youth can reach 
"" Where age gropes dimly, weak with stir and strain, 
"" And the full doctrine slumbers till to-day.' 
""Thus, what the Roman's lowered spear was found, 
""A bar to me who touched and handled truth, 
""Now proved the glozing of some new shrewd tongue, 
""This Ebion, this Cerinthus or their mates, 
""Till imminent was the outcry Save our Christ!' 
""Whereon I stated much of the Lord's life 
""Forgotten or misdelivered, and let it work. 
""Such work done, as it will be, what comes next? 
""What do I hear say, or conceive men say, 
"" Was John at all, and did he say he saw? 
"" Assure us, ere we ask what he might see!' 
 
""Is this indeed a burthen for late days, 
""And may I help to bear it with you all, 
""Using my weakness which becomes your strength? 
""For if a babe were born inside this grot, 
""Grew to a boy here, heard us praise the sun, 
""Yet had but yon sole glimmer in light's place,— 
""One loving him and wishful he should learn, 
""Would much rejoice himself was blinded first 
""Month by month here, so made to understand 
""How eyes, born darkling, apprehend amiss: 
""I think I could explain to such a child 
""There was more glow outside than gleams he caught, 
""Ay, nor need urge 'I saw it, so believe!' 
""It is a heavy burthen you shall bear 
""In latter days, new lands, or old grown strange, 
""Left without me, which must be very soon. 
""What is the doubt, my brothers? Quick with it! 
""I see you stand conversing, each new face, 
""Either in fields, of yellow summer eves, 
""On islets yet unnamed amid the sea; 
""Or pace for shelter 'neath a portico 
""Out of the crowd in some enormous town 
""Where now the larks sing in a solitude; 
""Or muse upon blank heaps of stone and sand 
""Idly conjectured to be Ephesus: 
""And no one asks his fellow any more 
"" Where is the promise of His coming?' but 
"" Was he revealed in any of His lives, 
"" As Power, as Love, as Influencing Soul?' 
 
""Quick, for time presses, tell the whole mind out, 
""And let us ask and answer and be saved! 
""My book speaks on, because it cannot pass; 
""One listens quietly, nor scoffs but pleads 
"" Here is a tale of things done ages since; 
"" What truth was ever told the second day? 
"" Wonders, that would prove doctrine, go for nought. 
"" Remains the doctrine, love; well, we must love, 
"" And what we love most, power and love in one, 
"" Let us acknowledge on the record here, 
"" Accepting these in Christ: must Christ then be? 
"" Has He been? Did not we ourselves make Him? 
"" Our mind receives but what it holds, no more. 
"" First of the love, then; we acknowledge Christ— 
"" A proof we comprehend His love, a proof 
"" We had such love already in ourselves, 
"" Knew first what else we should not recognize. 
""   'Tis mere projection from man's inmost mind, 
"" And, what he loves, thus falls reflected back, 
"" Becomes accounted somewhat out of him; 
"" He throws it up in air, it drops down earth's, 
"" With shape, name, story added, man's old way. 
"" How prove you Christ came otherwise at least? 
"" Next try the power: He made and rules the world: 
"" Certes there is a world once made, now ruled, 
"" Unless things have been ever as we see. 
"" Our sires declared a charioteer's yoked steeds 
"" Brought the sun up the east and down the west, 
"" Which only of itself now rises, sets, 
"" As if a hand impelled it and a will,— 
"" Thus they long thought, they who had will and hands: 
"" But the new question's whisper is distinct, 
"" Wherefore must all force needs be like ourselves? 
"" We have the hands, the will; what made and drives 
"" The sun is force, is law, is named, not known, 
"" While will and love we do know; marks of these, 
"" Eye-witnesses attest, so books declare— 
"" As that, to punish or reward our race, 
"" The sun at undue times arose or set 
"" Or else stood still: what do not men affirm? 
"" But earth requires as urgently reward 
"" Or punishment to-day as years ago, 
"" And none expects the sun will interpose: 
"" Therefore it was mere passion and mistake, 
"" Or erring zeal for right, which changed the truth. 
"" Go back, far, farther, to the birth of things; 
"" Ever the will, the intelligence, the love, 
"" Man's!—which he gives, supposing he but finds, 
"" As late he gave head, body, hands and feet, 
"" To help these in what forms he called his gods. 
"" First, Jove's brow, Juno's eyes were swept away, 
"" But Jove's wrath, Juno's pride continued long; 
"" As last, will, power, and love discarded these, 
"" So law in turn discards power, love, and will. 
"" What proveth God is otherwise at least? 
"" All else, projection from the mind of man!' 
 
""Nay, do not give me wine, for I am strong, 
""But place my gospel where I put my hands. 
 
""I say that man was made to grow, not stop; 
""That help, he needed once, and needs no more, 
""Having grown but an inch by, is withdrawn: 
""For he hath new needs, and new helps to these. 
""This imports solely, man should mount on each 
""New height in view; the help whereby he mounts, 
""The ladder-rung his foot has left, may fall, 
""Since all things suffer change save God the Truth. 
 
""Man apprehends Him newly at each stage 
""Whereat earth's ladder drops, its service done; 
""And nothing shall prove twice what once was proved. 
""You stick a garden-plot with ordered twigs 
""To show inside lie germs of herbs unborn, 
""And check the careless step would spoil their birth; 
""But when herbs wave, the guardian twigs may go, 
""Since should ye doubt of virtues, question kinds, 
""It is no longer for old twigs ye look, 
""Which proved once underneath lay store of seed, 
""But to the herb's self, by what light ye boast, 
""For what fruit's signs are. This book's fruit is plain, 
""Nor miracles need prove it any more. 
""Doth the fruit show? Then miracles bade 'ware 
""At first of root and stem, saved both till now 
""From trampling ox, rough boar and wanton goat. 
""What? Was man made a wheelwork to wind up, 
""And be discharged, and straight wound up anew? 
""No!—grown, his growth lasts; taught, he ne'er forgets: 
""May learn a thousand things, not twice the same. 
 
""This might be pagan teaching: now hear mine. 
 
""I say, that as the babe, you feed awhile, 
""Becomes a boy and fit to feed himself, 
""So, minds at first must be spoon-fed with truth: 
""When they can eat, babe's-nurture is withdrawn. 
""I fed the babe whether it would or no: 
""I bid the boy or feed himself or starve. 
""I cried once, 'That ye may believe in Christ, 
"" Behold this blind man shall receive his sight!' 
""I cry now, 'Urgest thou, for I am shrewd 
"" And smile at stories how John's word could cure— 
"" Repeat that miracle and take my faith?' 
""I say, that miracle was duly wrought 
""When, save for it, no faith was possible. 
""Whether a change were wrought i' the shows o' the world, 
""Whether the change came from our minds which see 
""Of shows o' the world so much as and no more 
""Than God wills for His purpose,—(what do I 
""See now, suppose you, there where you see rock 
""Round us?)—I know not; such was the effect, 
""So faith grew, making void more miracles 
""Because too much; they would compel, not help. 
""I say, the acknowledgment of God in Christ 
""Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee 
""All questions in the earth and out of it, 
""And has so far advanced thee to be wise. 
""Wouldst thou unprove this to re-prove the proved? 
""In life's mere minute, with power to use that proof, 
""Leave knowledge and revert to how it sprung? 
""Thou hast it; use it and forthwith, or die! 
 
""For I say, this is death and the sole death, 
""When a man's loss comes to him from his gain, 
""Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance, 
""And lack of love from love made manifest; 
""A lamp's death when, replete with oil, it chokes; 
""A stomach's when, surcharged with food, it starves. 
""With Ignorance was surety of a cure. 
""When man, appalled at nature, questioned first 
"" What if there lurk a might behind this might?' 
""He needed satisfaction God could give, 
""And did give, as ye have the written word: 
""But when he finds might still redouble might, 
""Yet asks, Since all is might, what use of will?' 
""—Will, the one source of might,—he being man 
""With a man's will and a man's might, to teach 
""In little how the two combine in large,— 
""That man has turned round on himself and stands, 
""Which in the course of nature is, to die. 
""And when man questioned, 'What if there be love 
"" Behind the will and might, as real as they?'— 
""He needed satisfaction God could give, 
""And did give, as ye have the written word: 
""But when, beholding that love everywhere, 
He reasons, Since such love is everywhere, 
"" And since ourselves can love and would be loved, 
"" We ourselves make the love, and Christ was not,'—

But he was dead; 't was about noon, the day
Somewhat declining: we five buried him
That eve, and then, dividing, went five ways,
And I, disguised, returned to Ephesus.
By this, the cave's mouth must be filled with sand.
Valens is lost, I know not of his trace;
The Bactrian was but a wild childish man,
And could not write nor speak, but only loved:
So, lest the memory of this go quite,
Seeing that I to-morrow fight the beasts,
I tell the same to Phœbas, whom believe!
For many look again to find that face, 
Beloved John's to whom I ministered, 
Somewhere in life about the world; they err:
Either mistaking what was darkly spoke
At ending of his book, as he relates,
Or misconceiving somewhat of this speech
Scattered from mouth to mouth, as I suppose.
Believe ye will not see him any more
About the world with his divine regard!
For all was as I say, and now the man
Lies as he lay once, breast to breast with God.
[Cerinthus read and mused; one added this:
""If Christ, as thou affirmest, be of men
""Mere man, the first and best but nothing more,— 
""Account Him, for reward of what He was,
""Now and for ever, wretchedest of all.
""For see; Himself conceived of life as love,
""Conceived of love as what must enter in,
""Fill up, make one with His each soul He loved.
""Thus much for man's joy, all men's joy for Him.
""Well, He is gone, thou sayest, to fit reward.
""But by this time are many souls set free,
""And very many still retained alive:
""Nay, should His coming be delayed awhile,
""Say, ten years longer (twelve years, some compute)
""See if, for every finger of thy hands,
""There be not found, that day the world shall end,
""Hundreds of souls, each holding by Christ's word
""That He will grow incorporate with all,
""With me as Pamphylax, with him as John,
""Groom for each bride!  Can a mere man do this?
""Yet Christ saith, this He lived and died to do.

Herman Melville,1819 – 1891,John Marr and Other Sailors,"Since as in night's deck-watch ye show,
Why, lads, so silent here to me,
Your watchmate of times long ago?
Once, for all the darkling sea,
You your voices raised how clearly,
Striking in when tempest sung;
Hoisting up the storm-sail cheerly,
Life is storm–let storm! you rung.
Taking things as fated merely,
Childlike though the world ye spanned;
Nor holding unto life too dearly,
Ye who held your lives in hand–
Skimmers, who on oceans four
Petrels were, and larks ashore.

O, not from memory lightly flung,
Forgot, like strains no more availing,
The heart to music haughtier strung;
Nay, frequent near me, never staleing,
Whose good feeling kept ye young.
Like tides that enter creek or stream,
Ye come, ye visit me, or seem
Swimming out from seas of faces,
Alien myriads memory traces,
To enfold me in a dream!

I yearn as ye. But rafts that strain,
Parted, shall they lock again?
Twined we were, entwined, then riven,
Ever to new embracements driven,
Shifting gulf-weed of the main!
And how if one here shift no more,
Lodged by the flinging surge ashore?
Nor less, as now, in eve's decline,
Your shadowy fellowship is mine.
Ye float around me, form and feature:–
Tattooings, ear-rings, love-locks curled;
Barbarians of man's simpler nature,
Unworldly servers of the world.
Yea, present all, and dear to me,
Though shades, or scouring China's sea.

Whither, whither, merchant-sailors,
Whitherward now in roaring gales?
Competing still, ye huntsman-whalers,
In leviathan's wake what boat prevails?
And man-of-war's men, whereaway?
If now no dinned drum beat to quarters
On the wilds of midnight waters–
Foemen looming through the spray;
Do yet your gangway lanterns, streaming,
Vainly strive to pierce below,
When, tilted from the slant plank gleaming,
A brother you see to darkness go?

But, gunmates lashed in shotted canvas,
If where long watch-below ye keep,
Never the shrill “All hands up hammocks!”
Breaks the spell that charms your sleep,
And summoning trumps might vainly call,
And booming guns implore–
A beat, a heart-beat musters all,
One heart-beat at heart-core.
It musters. But to clasp, retain;
To see you at the halyards main–
To hear your chorus once again!",ballad,verse forms,"['Ballad', 'Oceans']",,https://poets.org/poem/john-marr-and-other-sailors,https://poets.org/poet/herman-melville,1888,1819.0,1891.0,['Ballad'],['Oceans'],[],Academy of American Poets
Walt Whitman,1819 – 1892,The Indications [excerpt],"The words of the true poems give you more than poems, 
They give you to form for yourself, poems, religions, politics, war, peace, behavior, histories, essays, romances, and everything else, 
They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,
They do not seek beauty—they are sought, 
Forever touching them, or close upon them, follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick. 

They prepare for death—yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset, 
They bring none to his or her terminus, or to be content and full; 
Whom they take, they take into space, to behold the birth of stars, to learn one of the meanings,
To launch off with absolute faith—to sweep through the ceaseless rings, and never be quiet again.",ars poetica,types/modes,"['Ars Poetica', 'Public Domain']","From Leaves of Grass, 1900. This poem is in the public domain.

Monotony of surface & of form 
Without a break to hang a guess upon.

By thickest canvass, where the golden rays 
Are clothed in hemp. No figure lingering 
Pauses to feed the hunger of the eye 
Or rest a little on the lap of life. 
All hurry on & look upon the ground, 
Or glance unmarking at the passers by

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,O Captain! My Captain!,"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
                         But O heart! heart! heart!
                            O the bleeding drops of red,
                               Where on the deck my Captain lies,
                                  Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
                         Here Captain! dear father!
                            This arm beneath your head!
                               It is some dream that on the deck,
                                 You’ve fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
                         Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
                            But I with mournful tread,
                               Walk the deck my Captain lies,
                                  Fallen cold and dead.",elegy,types/modes,"['Suitable for Children', 'Suitable for Teens', 'Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Social Commentaries', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy']",n/a,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45474/o-captain-my-captain,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Walt Whitman,1819–1892,When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d,"1 
When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom’d, 
And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night, 
I mourn’d, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring. 
 
Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, 
Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west, 
And thought of him I love. 
 
2 
O powerful western fallen star! 
O shades of night—O moody, tearful night! 
O great star disappear’d—O the black murk that hides the star! 
O cruel hands that hold me powerless—O helpless soul of me! 
O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul. 
 
3 
In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash’d palings, 
Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, 
With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love, 
With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush in the dooryard, 
With delicate-color’d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, 
A sprig with its flower I break. 
 
4 
In the swamp in secluded recesses, 
A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. 
 
Solitary the thrush, 
The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, 
Sings by himself a song. 
 
Song of the bleeding throat, 
Death’s outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know, 
If thou wast not granted to sing thou would’st surely die.) 
 
5 
Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, 
Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep’d from the ground, spotting the gray debris, 
Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass, 
Passing the yellow-spear’d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen, 
Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards, 
Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, 
Night and day journeys a coffin. 
 
6 
Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, 
Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land, 
With the pomp of the inloop’d flags with the cities draped in black, 
With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil’d women standing, 
With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night, 
With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads, 
With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, 
With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn, 
With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour’d around the coffin, 
The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—where amid these you journey, 
With the tolling tolling bells’ perpetual clang, 
Here, coffin that slowly passes, 
I give you my sprig of lilac. 
 
7 
(Nor for you, for one alone, 
Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring, 
For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred death. 
 
All over bouquets of roses, 
O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies, 
But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, 
Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes, 
With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, 
For you and the coffins all of you O death.) 
 
8 
O western orb sailing the heaven, 
Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk’d, 
As I walk’d in silence the transparent shadowy night, 
As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night, 
As you droop’d from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all look’d on,) 
As we wander’d together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from sleep,) 
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe, 
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night, 
As I watch’d where you pass’d and was lost in the netherward black of the night, 
As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, 
Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone. 
 
9 
Sing on there in the swamp, 
O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call, 
I hear, I come presently, I understand you, 
But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain’d me, 
The star my departing comrade holds and detains me. 
 
10 
O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved? 
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone? 
And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love? 
 
Sea-winds blown from east and west, 
Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there on the prairies meeting, 
These and with these and the breath of my chant, 
I’ll perfume the grave of him I love. 
 
11 
O what shall I hang on the chamber walls? 
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, 
To adorn the burial-house of him I love? 
 
Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes, 
With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, 
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air, 
With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific, 
In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there, 
With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows, 
And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, 
And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning. 
 
12 
Lo, body and soul—this land, 
My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships, 
The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio’s shores and flashing Missouri, 
And ever the far-spreading prairies cover’d with grass and corn. 
 
Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty, 
The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes, 
The gentle soft-born measureless light, 
The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill’d noon, 
The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars, 
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. 
 
13 
Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird, 
Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes, 
Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines. 
 
Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song, 
Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe. 
 
O liquid and free and tender! 
O wild and loose to my soul—O wondrous singer! 
You only I hear—yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,) 
Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me. 
 
14 
Now while I sat in the day and look’d forth, 
In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops, 
In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests, 
In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb’d winds and the storms,) 
Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, 
The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail’d, 
And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, 
And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages, 
And the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent—lo, then and there, 
Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, 
Appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail, 
And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. 
 
Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, 
And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, 
And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, 
I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not, 
Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, 
To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still. 
 
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me, 
The gray-brown bird I know receiv’d us comrades three, 
And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love. 
 
From deep secluded recesses, 
From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, 
Came the carol of the bird. 
 
And the charm of the carol rapt me, 
As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night, 
And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird. 
 
Come lovely and soothing death, 
Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, 
In the day, in the night, to all, to each, 
Sooner or later delicate death. 
 
Prais’d be the fathomless universe, 
For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, 
And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise! 
For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death. 
 
Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet, 
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? 
Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all, 
I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. 
 
Approach strong deliveress, 
When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead, 
Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee, 
Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death. 
 
From me to thee glad serenades, 
Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee, 
And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting, 
And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night. 
 
The night in silence under many a star, 
The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know, 
And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil’d death, 
And the body gratefully nestling close to thee. 
 
Over the tree-tops I float thee a song, 
Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide, 
Over the dense-pack’d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways, 
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death. 
 
15 
To the tally of my soul, 
Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, 
With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night. 
 
Loud in the pines and cedars dim, 
Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume, 
And I with my comrades there in the night. 
 
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, 
As to long panoramas of visions. 
 
And I saw askant the armies, 
I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags, 
Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc’d with missiles I saw them, 
And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody, 
And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) 
And the staffs all splinter’d and broken. 
 
I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, 
And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them, 
I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war, 
But I saw they were not as was thought, 
They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer’d not, 
The living remain’d and suffer’d, the mother suffer’d, 
And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer’d, 
And the armies that remain’d suffer’d. 
 
16 
Passing the visions, passing the night, 
Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands, 
Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, 
Victorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song, 
As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, 
Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, 
Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven, 
As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, 
Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves, 
I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring. 
 
I cease from my song for thee, 
From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, 
O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night. 
 
Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night, 
The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, 
And the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul, 
With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, 
With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird, 
Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well, 
For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake, 
Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,I Sing the Body Electric,"1 
I sing the body electric, 
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, 
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, 
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul. 
 
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves? 
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? 
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? 
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? 
 
2 
The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, 
That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. 
 
The expression of the face balks account, 
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, 
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, 
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, 
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, 
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. 
 
The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, 
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, 
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, 
Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, 
The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, 
The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, 
The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, 
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, 
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, 
The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; 
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, 
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, 
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; 
Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, 
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count. 
 
3 
I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, 
And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. 
 
This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, 
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, 
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, 
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, 
They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, 
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, 
He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, 
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, 
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, 
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. 
 
4 
I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough, 
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, 
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, 
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? 
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. 
 
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, 
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well. 
 
5 
This is the female form, 
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, 
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, 
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, 
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, 
Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, 
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, 
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, 
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, 
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, 
Undulating into the willing and yielding day, 
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. 
 
This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, 
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. 
 
Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, 
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. 
 
The female contains all qualities and tempers them, 
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance, 
She is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, 
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. 
 
As I see my soul reflected in Nature, 
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, 
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see. 
 
6 
The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, 
He too is all qualities, he is action and power, 
The flush of the known universe is in him, 
Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, 
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, 
The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, 
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, 
Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, 
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?) 
 
The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, 
No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? 
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? 
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, 
Each has his or her place in the procession. 
 
(All is a procession, 
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.) 
 
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? 
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? 
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, 
For you only, and not for him and her? 
 
7 
A man’s body at auction, 
(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) 
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. 
 
Gentlemen look on this wonder, 
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, 
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, 
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d. 
 
In this head the all-baffling brain, 
In it and below it the makings of heroes. 
 
Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, 
They shall be stript that you may see them. 
 
Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, 
Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, 
And wonders within there yet. 
 
Within there runs blood, 
The same old blood! the same red-running blood! 
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, 
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?) 
 
This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, 
In him the start of populous states and rich republics, 
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. 
 
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? 
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?) 
 
8 
A woman’s body at auction, 
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, 
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. 
 
Have you ever loved the body of a woman? 
Have you ever loved the body of a man? 
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? 
 
If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, 
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, 
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. 
 
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? 
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. 
 
9 
O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, 
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) 
I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems,

The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, 
The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, 
The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, 
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Song of Myself (1892 version),"1
I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.

My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death.

Creeds and schools in abeyance,
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check with original energy.

2
Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.

The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.

The smoke of my own breath,
Echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,
My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,
The sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind,
A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,
The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.

Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much?
Have you practis’d so long to learn to read?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.

3
I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end,
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.

There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world.

Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.

To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.

Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
I and this mystery here we stand.

Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.

Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.

Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.

Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.

I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;
As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,
Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty,
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?

4
Trippers and askers surround me,
People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,
The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,
My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,
The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;
These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
But they are not the Me myself.

Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,
Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.

Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,
I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.

5
I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.

Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.

I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.

Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,
And that a kelson of the creation is love,
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.

6 
A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.

I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.

Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?

Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.

Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.

And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.

Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,
And here you are the mothers’ laps.

This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.

O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.

I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.

What do you think has become of the young and old men?
And what do you think has become of the women and children?

They are alive and well somewhere,
The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,
And ceas’d the moment life appear’d.

All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.

7
Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.

I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots,
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,
The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.

I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,
(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)

Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,
For me those that have been boys and that love women,
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,
For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
For me children and the begetters of children.

Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.

8
The little one sleeps in its cradle,
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.

The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,
I peeringly view them from the top.

The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has fallen.

The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders,
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,
The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,
The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs,
The flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,
The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
What groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits,
What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,
What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum,
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,
I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I depart.

9
The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
The armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.

I am there, I help, I came stretch’d atop of the load,
I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,
And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.

10
Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,
Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game,
Falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.

The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,

My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.

The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,
I tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;
You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.

I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl,
Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,
On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,
She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.

The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,
And brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet,
And gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north,
I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.

11
Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,
Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;
Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.

She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.

Which of the young men does she like the best?
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.

Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.

Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.

The beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair,
Little streams pass’d all over their bodies.

An unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies,
It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.

The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,
They do not think whom they souse with spray.

12
The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.

Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,
Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.

From the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements,
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,
Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,
They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.

13
The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,
The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the string-piece,
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,
His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,
The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.

I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,
I go with the team also.

In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing,
To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,
Absorbing all to myself and for this song.

Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.

My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,
They rise together, they slowly circle around.

I believe in those wing’d purposes,
And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,
And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,
And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.

14
The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,
Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,
The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,
Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.

The sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,
The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,
I see in them and myself the same old law.

The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,
They scorn the best I can do to relate them.

I am enamour’d of growing out-doors,
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,
Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.

What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,
Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,
Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,
Scattering it freely forever.

15
The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,
The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,
The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,
The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,
The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,

The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,
The deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar,
The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,
The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye,
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm’d case,
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother’s bed-room;)
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;
The malform’d limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table,
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;
The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove,
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,
The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,
Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;
The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,
As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle,
The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other,
The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret and harks to the musical rain,
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,
The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm’d cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale,
The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways,
As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers,
The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,
The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child,
The clean-hair’d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,
The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold,
The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,
The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!)
The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,
The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;)
The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly,
The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips,
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)
The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries,
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,
The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,
As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,
The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar,
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain’d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,
Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,

Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them,
In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport,
The city sleeps and the country sleeps,
The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;
And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.

16
I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
Stuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine,
One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same,
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live,
A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,
A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;
At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,
At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch,
Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving their big proportions,)
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat,
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,
A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,
A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,
Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.

I resist any thing better than my own diversity,
Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,
And am not stuck up, and am in my place.

(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,
The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)

17
These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,
If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,
If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.

This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,
This the common air that bathes the globe.

18
With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.

Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.

I beat and pound for the dead,
I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.

Vivas to those who have fail’d!
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!

19
This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appointments with all,
I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
The heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
There shall be no difference between them and the rest.

This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,
This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,
This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.

Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.

Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?

This hour I tell things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.

20
Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?

What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?

All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
Else it were time lost listening to me.

I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.

Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d,
I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.

Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?

Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close,
I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.

In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.

I know I am solid and sound,
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.

I know I am deathless,
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass,
I know I shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.

I know I am august,
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)

I exist as I am, that is enough,
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
And if each and all be aware I sit content.

One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,
And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.

My foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite,
I laugh at what you call dissolution,
And I know the amplitude of time.

21
I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.

I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.

I chant the chant of dilation or pride,
We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,
I show that size is only development.

Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.

I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.

Press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night!
Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!
Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.

Smile O voluptuous cool-breath’d earth!
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt!
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!
Far-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth!
Smile, for your lover comes.

Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!
O unspeakable passionate love.

22
You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,
We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,
Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,
Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.

Sea of stretch’d ground-swells,
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,
Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves,
Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,
I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.

Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,
Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.

I am he attesting sympathy,
(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)

I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.

What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,
My gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait,
I moisten the roots of all that has grown.

Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?

I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.

This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,
There is no better than it and now.

What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder,
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.

23
Endless unfolding of words of ages!
And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.

A word of the faith that never balks,
Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.

It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,
That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.

I accept Reality and dare not question it,
Materialism first and last imbuing.

Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,
This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches,
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.
This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.

Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!
Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,
I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.

Less the reminders of properties told my words,
And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.

24
Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,
Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,
No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,
No more modest than immodest.

Unscrew the locks from the doors!
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!

Whoever degrades another degrades me,
And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.

Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.

I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.

Through me many long dumb voices,
Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,
Voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,
And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,
And of the rights of them the others are down upon,
Of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,
Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.

Through me forbidden voices,
Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and I remove the veil,
Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.

I do not press my fingers across my mouth,
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,
Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.

I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.

Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch’d from,
The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,
This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.

If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,
Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
Root of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
Mix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!
Sun so generous it shall be you!
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!
Hands I have taken, face I have kiss’d, mortal I have ever touch’d, it shall be you.

I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,
I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.

That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.

To behold the day-break!
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,
The air tastes good to my palate.

Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,
Scooting obliquely high and low.

Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,
Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.

The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,
The heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head,
The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!

25
Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,
If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.

We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.

My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.

Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,
Walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?

Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,
Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
I underlying causes to balance them at last,
My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,
Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)

My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,
Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.

Writing and talk do not prove me,
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.

26
Now I will do nothing but listen,
To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.

I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,
I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,
Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,
Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,
The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,
The heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,
The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,
The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,
The slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,
(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)

I hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,)
I hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.

I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
Ah this indeed is music—this suits me.

A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.

I hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?)
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess’d them,
It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves,
I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,
Steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,

At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,
And that we call Being.

27
To be in any form, what is that?
(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)
If nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.

Mine is no callous shell,
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.

I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,
To touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as I can stand.

28
Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,
My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,
Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,
Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,
Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,
They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.

The sentries desert every other part of me,
They have left me helpless to a red marauder,
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.

I am given up by traitors,
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,
I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.

You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,
Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.

29
Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch!
Did it make you ache so, leaving me?

Parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.

Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,
Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.

30
All truths wait in all things,
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,
The insignificant is as big to me as any,
(What is less or more than a touch?)

Logic and sermons never convince,
The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.

(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,
Only what nobody denies is so.)

A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,
And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.

31
I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,
And the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest,
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,
And the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue,
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.

I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,
And am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over,
And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
But call any thing back again when I desire it.

In vain the speeding or shyness,
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,
In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones,
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
In vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to Labrador,
I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.

32
I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d,
I stand and look at them long and long.

They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.

So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.

I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?

Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.

A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,
Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.

His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.

I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,
Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.

33
Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess’d at,
What I guess’d when I loaf’d on the grass,
What I guess’d while I lay alone in my bed,
And again as I walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.

My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,
I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,
I am afoot with my vision.

By the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen,
Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,
Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,
Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,
Scorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,
Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;
Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,
Over the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters,
Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,
Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;
Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,
Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,
Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;
Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,
Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,)
Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,
Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,
Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,
Where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents,
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;
Where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,
Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,
Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,
Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,
At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,
At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,
At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,
At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;
Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,
Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,
Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,
Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding,
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,
Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,
Where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,
Where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery,
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,
Where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,
Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,
Through the salt-lick or orange",free verse,meters,"['Suitable for Children', 'Suitable for Teens', 'Related Audio', 'Related Video', 'Living', 'Health & Illness', 'The Body', 'The Mind', 'Love', 'Desire', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Religion', 'The Spiritual', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Techniques', 'Free Verse', 'Anaphora']","Walt Whitman, ""Song of Myself"" from Leaves of Grass (: Norton, 1973)",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45477/song-of-myself-1892-version,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Walt Whitman,1819–1892,On the Beach at Night Alone,"On the beach at night alone, 
As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song, 
As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future.

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Song of the Open Road,"1 
Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, 
Healthy, free, the world before me, 
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose. 
 
Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune, 
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, 
Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms, 
Strong and content I travel the open road. 
 
The earth, that is sufficient, 
I do not want the constellations any nearer, 
I know they are very well where they are, 
I know they suffice for those who belong to them. 
 
(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens, 
I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go, 
I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, 
I am fill’d with them, and I will fill them in return.) 
 
2 
You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all that is here, 
I believe that much unseen is also here. 
 
Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial, 
The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied; 
The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics, 
The escaped youth, the rich person’s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple, 
 
The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back from the town, 
They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted, 
None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me. 
 
3 
You air that serves me with breath to speak! 
You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape! 
You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers! 
You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides! 
I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me. 
 
You flagg’d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges! 
You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships! 
 
You rows of houses! you window-pierc’d façades! you roofs! 
You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards! 
You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much! 
You doors and ascending steps! you arches! 
You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings! 
From all that has touch’d you I believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me, 
From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me. 
 
4 
The earth expanding right hand and left hand, 
The picture alive, every part in its best light, 
The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted, 
The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road. 
 
O highway I travel, do you say to me Do not leave me? 
Do you say Venture not—if you leave me you are lost? 
Do you say I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied, adhere to me? 
 
O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you, 
You express me better than I can express myself, 
You shall be more to me than my poem. 
 
I think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also, 
I think I could stop here myself and do miracles, 
I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me, 
I think whoever I see must be happy. 
 
5 
From this hour I ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines, 
Going where I list, my own master total and absolute, 
Listening to others, considering well what they say, 
Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, 
Gently,but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me. 
I inhale great draughts of space, 
The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine. 
 
I am larger, better than I thought, 
I did not know I held so much goodness. 
 
All seems beautiful to me, 
I can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me I would do the same to you, 
I will recruit for myself and you as I go, 
I will scatter myself among men and women as I go, 
I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them, 
Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me, 
Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me. 
 
6 
Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me, 
Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear’d it would not astonish me. 
 
Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons, 
It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth. 
 
Here a great personal deed has room, 
(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men, 
Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.) 
 
Here is the test of wisdom, 
Wisdom is not finally tested in schools, 
Wisdom cannot be pass’d from one having it to another not having it, 
Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof, 
Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content, 
Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things; 
Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul. 
 
Now I re-examine philosophies and religions, 
They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents. 
 
Here is realization, 
Here is a man tallied—he realizes here what he has in him, 
The past, the future, majesty, love—if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them. 
 
Only the kernel of every object nourishes; 
Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me? 
Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? 
 
Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos; 
Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers? 
Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls? 
 
7 
Here is the efflux of the soul, 
The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates, ever provoking questions, 
These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they? 
Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood? 
Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? 
Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me? 
(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as I pass;) 
What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers? 
What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side? 
What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by and pause? 
What gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will? what gives them to be free to mine? 
 
8 
The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness, 
I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times, 
Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged. 
 
Here rises the fluid and attaching character, 
The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman, 
(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.) 
 
Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old, 
From it falls distill’d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments, 
Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. 
 
9 
Allons! whoever you are come travel with me! 
Traveling with me you find what never tires. 
 
The earth never tires, 
The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first, 
Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop’d, 
I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell. 
 
Allons! we must not stop here, 
However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling we cannot remain here, 
However shelter’d this port and however calm these waters we must not anchor here, 
However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted to receive it but a little while.

Allons! the inducements shall be greater, 
We will sail pathless and wild seas, 
We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper speeds by under full sail. 
 
Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements, 
Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity; 
Allons! from all formules! 
From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests. 
 
The stale cadaver blocks up the passage—the burial waits no longer. 
 
Allons! yet take warning! 
He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance, 
None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health, 
Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself, 
Only those may come who come in sweet and determin’d bodies, 
No diseas’d person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here. 
 
(I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes, 
We convince by our presence.) 
 
11 
Listen! I will be honest with you, 
I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes, 
These are the days that must happen to you: 
You shall not heap up what is call’d riches, 
You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve, 
You but arrive at the city to which you were destin’d, you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call’d by an irresistible call to depart, 
You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you, 
What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting, 
You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach’d hands toward you. 
 
12 
Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them! 
They too are on the road—they are the swift and majestic men—they are the greatest women, 
Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas, 
Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land, 
Habituès of many distant countries, habituès of far-distant dwellings, 
Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers, 
Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore, 
Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, bearers of children, 
Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins, 
Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious years each emerging from that which preceded it, 
Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases, 
Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days, 
Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded and well-grain’d manhood, 
Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass’d, content, 
Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood, 
Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, 
Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death. 
 
13 
Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless, 
To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights, 
To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they tend to, 
Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys, 
To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it, 
To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it, 
To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you, however long but it stretches and waits for you, 
To see no being, not God’s or any, but you also go thither, 
To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it, 
To take the best of the farmer’s farm and the rich man’s elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens, 
To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through, 
To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go, 
To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them, to gather the love out of their hearts, 
To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them behind you, 
To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for traveling souls. 
 
All parts away for the progress of souls, 
All religion, all solid things, arts, governments—all that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe. 
 
Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance. 
 
Forever alive, forever forward, 
Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble, dissatisfied, 
Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men, 
They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go, 
But I know that they go toward the best—toward something great. 
 
Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth! 
You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you built it, or though it has been built for you. 
 
Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen! 
It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it. 
 
Behold through you as bad as the rest, 
Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, 
Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash’d and trimm’d faces, 
Behold a secret silent loathing and despair. 
 
No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession, 
Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, 
Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors, 
In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, 
Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom, everywhere, 
Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, 
Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, 
Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, 
Speaking of any thing else but never of itself. 
 
14 
Allons! through struggles and wars! 
The goal that was named cannot be countermanded. 
 
Have the past struggles succeeded? 
What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature? 
Now understand me well—it is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary. 
 
My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion, 
He going with me must go well arm’d, 
He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertions. 
 
15 
Allons! the road is before us! 
It is safe—I have tried it—my own feet have tried it well—be not detain’d! 
 
Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen’d! 
Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn’d! 
Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher! 
Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law. 
 
Camerado, I give you my hand! 
I give you my love more precious than money, 
I give you myself before preaching or law; 
Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me? 
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?",free verse,meters,"['Related Audio', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Free Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48859/song-of-the-open-road,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Song of Myself: 35,"Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.

Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;
Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.

We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,
My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.

We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.

Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.

The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.

Our frigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?

Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting.

Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast,
Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.

The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.

Not a moment’s cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.

One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.

Serene stands the little captain,
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.

Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.",free verse,meters,"['Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Free Verse']","Source:

Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves,

Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,

The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,

The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,

Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.",free verse,meters,"['Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Music', 'Free Verse']",n/a,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46480/i-hear-america-singing,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force,
Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,
Into the school where the scholar is studying,
Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride,
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,
So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!

Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,
No bargainers’ bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—would they continue?
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Make no parley—stop for no expostulation,
Mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer,
Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,I Saw in Louisiana A Live-Oak Growing,"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing, 
All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches, 
Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green, 
And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself, 
But I wonder’d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could not, 
And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss, 
And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room, 
It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends, 
(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,) 
Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love; 
For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide flat space, 
Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near, 
I know very well I could not.",free verse,meters,"['Love', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Nature', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Free Verse']","Source:

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field one Night,"Vigil strange I kept on the field one night; 
When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day, 
One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget, 
One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground, 
Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle, 
Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way, 
Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) 
Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind, 
Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading, 
Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night, 
But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed, 
Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands, 
Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade—not a tear, not a word, 
Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier, 
As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole, 
Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death, 
I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,) 
Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d, 
My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form, 
Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet, 
And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited, 
Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim, 
Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) 
Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d, 
I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,On the Beach at Night,"On the beach at night, 
Stands a child with her father, 
Watching the east, the autumn sky. 
 
Up through the darkness, 
While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading, 
Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky, 
Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east, 
Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter, 
And nigh at hand, only a very little above, 
Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades. 
 
From the beach the child holding the hand of her father, 
Those burial-clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all, 
Watching, silently weeps. 
 
Weep not, child, 
Weep not, my darling, 
With these kisses let me remove your tears, 
The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious, 
They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in apparition, 
Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the Pleiades shall emerge, 
They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall shine out again, 
The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they endure, 
The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall again shine. 
 
Then dearest child mournest thou only for Jupiter? 
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars? 
 
Something there is, 
(With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper, 
I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,) 
Something there is more immortal even than the stars,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"1 
Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face! 
Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face. 
 
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me! 
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose, 
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose. 
 
2 
The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day, 
The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, 
The similitudes of the past and those of the future, 
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, 
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, 
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, 
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others. 
 
Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore, 
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide, 
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east, 
Others will see the islands large and small; 
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, 
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, 
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide. 
 
3 
It avails not, time nor place—distance avails not, 
I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence, 
Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt, 
Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd, 
Just as you are refresh’d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was refresh’d, 
Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was hurried, 
Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, I look’d. 
 
I too many and many a time cross’d the river of old, 
Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies, 
Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow, 
Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south, 
Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water, 
Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams, 
Look’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water, 
Look’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward, 
Look’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet, 
Look’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving, 
Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me, 
Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor, 
The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, 
The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants, 
The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses, 
The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels, 
The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset, 
The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening, 
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks, 
On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter, 
On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night, 
Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets. 
 
4 
These and all else were to me the same as they are to you, 
I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river, 
The men and women I saw were all near to me, 
Others the same—others who look back on me because I look’d forward to them, 
(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.) 
 
5 
What is it then between us? 
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us? 
 
Whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not, 
I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine, 
I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it, 
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me, 
In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me, 
In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me, 
I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution, 
I too had receiv’d identity by my body, 
That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body. 
 
6 
It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, 
The dark threw its patches down upon me also, 
The best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious, 
My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? 
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil, 
I am he who knew what it was to be evil, 
I too knitted the old knot of contrariety, 
Blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d, 
Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak, 
Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant, 
The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me, 
The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, 
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting, 
Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest, 
Was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing, 
Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat, 
Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word, 
Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, 
 
Play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, 
The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, 
Or as small as we like, or both great and small. 
 
7 
Closer yet I approach you, 
What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you—I laid in my stores in advance, 
I consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born. 
 
Who was to know what should come home to me? 
Who knows but I am enjoying this? 
Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me? 
 
8 
Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm’d Manhattan? 
River and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide? 
The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter? 
 
What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach? 
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face? 
Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you? 
 
We understand then do we not? 
What I promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted? 
What the study could not teach—what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not? 
 
9 
Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide! 
Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves! 
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me! 
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers! 
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn! 
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers! 
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution! 
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly! 
 
Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name! 
Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress! 
Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it! 
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you; 
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current; 
Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air; 
Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you! 
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water! 
Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters! 
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset! 
Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses! 
 
Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are, 
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul, 
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas, 
Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, 
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual, 
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting. 
 
You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers, 
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, 
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us, 
We use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us, 
We fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also, 
You furnish your parts toward eternity, 
Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.",free verse,meters,"['Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Free Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45470/crossing-brooklyn-ferry,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, 
It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, 
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d,"1 
When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom’d, 
And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night, 
I mourn’d, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring. 
 
Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, 
Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west, 
And thought of him I love. 
 
2 
O powerful western fallen star! 
O shades of night—O moody, tearful night! 
O great star disappear’d—O the black murk that hides the star! 
O cruel hands that hold me powerless—O helpless soul of me! 
O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul. 
 
3 
In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash’d palings, 
Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, 
With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong I love, 
With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush in the dooryard, 
With delicate-color’d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, 
A sprig with its flower I break. 
 
4 
In the swamp in secluded recesses, 
A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song. 
 
Solitary the thrush, 
The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, 
Sings by himself a song. 
 
Song of the bleeding throat, 
Death’s outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know, 
If thou wast not granted to sing thou would’st surely die.) 
 
5 
Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, 
Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep’d from the ground, spotting the gray debris, 
Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass, 
Passing the yellow-spear’d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen, 
Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards, 
Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, 
Night and day journeys a coffin. 
 
6 
Coffin that passes through lanes and streets, 
Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land, 
With the pomp of the inloop’d flags with the cities draped in black, 
With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil’d women standing, 
With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night, 
With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads, 
With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, 
With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn, 
With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour’d around the coffin, 
The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—where amid these you journey, 
With the tolling tolling bells’ perpetual clang, 
Here, coffin that slowly passes, 
I give you my sprig of lilac. 
 
7 
(Nor for you, for one alone, 
Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring, 
For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred death. 
 
All over bouquets of roses, 
O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies, 
But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, 
Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes, 
With loaded arms I come, pouring for you, 
For you and the coffins all of you O death.) 
 
8 
O western orb sailing the heaven, 
Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk’d, 
As I walk’d in silence the transparent shadowy night, 
As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night, 
As you droop’d from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all look’d on,) 
As we wander’d together the solemn night, (for something I know not what kept me from sleep,) 
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe, 
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night, 
As I watch’d where you pass’d and was lost in the netherward black of the night, 
As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, 
Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone. 
 
9 
Sing on there in the swamp, 
O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your call, 
I hear, I come presently, I understand you, 
But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain’d me, 
The star my departing comrade holds and detains me. 
 
10 
O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved? 
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone? 
And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love? 
 
Sea-winds blown from east and west, 
Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea, till there on the prairies meeting, 
These and with these and the breath of my chant, 
I’ll perfume the grave of him I love. 
 
11 
O what shall I hang on the chamber walls? 
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls, 
To adorn the burial-house of him I love? 
 
Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes, 
With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, 
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air, 
With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific, 
In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there, 
With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows, 
And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, 
And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning. 
 
12 
Lo, body and soul—this land, 
My own Manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships, 
The varied and ample land, the South and the North in the light, Ohio’s shores and flashing Missouri, 
And ever the far-spreading prairies cover’d with grass and corn. 
 
Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty, 
The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes, 
The gentle soft-born measureless light, 
The miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill’d noon, 
The coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars, 
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land. 
 
13 
Sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird, 
Sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes, 
Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines. 
 
Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song, 
Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe. 
 
O liquid and free and tender! 
O wild and loose to my soul—O wondrous singer! 
You only I hear—yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,) 
Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me. 
 
14 
Now while I sat in the day and look’d forth, 
In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops, 
In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests, 
In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb’d winds and the storms,) 
Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, 
The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail’d, 
And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, 
And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages, 
And the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent—lo, then and there, 
Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, 
Appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail, 
And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death. 
 
Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, 
And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, 
And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, 
I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not, 
Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, 
To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still. 
 
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me, 
The gray-brown bird I know receiv’d us comrades three, 
And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love. 
 
From deep secluded recesses, 
From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, 
Came the carol of the bird. 
 
And the charm of the carol rapt me, 
As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night, 
And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird. 
 
Come lovely and soothing death, 
Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, 
In the day, in the night, to all, to each, 
Sooner or later delicate death. 
 
Prais’d be the fathomless universe, 
For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, 
And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise! 
For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death. 
 
Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet, 
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? 
Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all, 
I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly. 
 
Approach strong deliveress, 
When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead, 
Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee, 
Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death. 
 
From me to thee glad serenades, 
Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee, 
And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting, 
And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night. 
 
The night in silence under many a star, 
The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know, 
And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil’d death, 
And the body gratefully nestling close to thee. 
 
Over the tree-tops I float thee a song, 
Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide, 
Over the dense-pack’d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways, 
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death. 
 
15 
To the tally of my soul, 
Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, 
With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night. 
 
Loud in the pines and cedars dim, 
Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume, 
And I with my comrades there in the night. 
 
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, 
As to long panoramas of visions. 
 
And I saw askant the armies, 
I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags, 
Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc’d with missiles I saw them, 
And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody, 
And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) 
And the staffs all splinter’d and broken. 
 
I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, 
And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them, 
I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war, 
But I saw they were not as was thought, 
They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer’d not, 
The living remain’d and suffer’d, the mother suffer’d, 
And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer’d, 
And the armies that remain’d suffer’d. 
 
16 
Passing the visions, passing the night, 
Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands, 
Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, 
Victorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song, 
As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, 
Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, 
Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven, 
As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses, 
Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves, 
I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring. 
 
I cease from my song for thee, 
From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, 
O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night. 
 
Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night, 
The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, 
And the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul, 
With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, 
With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird, 
Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well, 
For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake, 
Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,

Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,"Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird’s throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight,
Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wander’d alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
Down from the shower’d halo,
Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,
Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,
From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,
From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings I heard,
From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears,
From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist,
From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,
From the myriad thence-arous’d words,
From the word stronger and more delicious than any,
From such as now they start the scene revisiting,
As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,
Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,
A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,
Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,
I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,
Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,
A reminiscence sing.

Once Paumanok,
When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass was growing,
Up this seashore in some briers,
Two feather’d guests from Alabama, two together,
And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,
And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,
And every day the she-bird crouch’d on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,
And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,
Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.

Shine! shine! shine!
Pour down your warmth, great sun!
While we bask, we two together.

Two together!
Winds blow south, or winds blow north,
Day come white, or night come black,
Home, or rivers and mountains from home,
Singing all time, minding no time,
While we two keep together.

Till of a sudden,
May-be kill’d, unknown to her mate,
One forenoon the she-bird crouch’d not on the nest,
Nor return’d that afternoon, nor the next,
Nor ever appear’d again.

And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,
And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,
Over the hoarse surging of the sea,
Or flitting from brier to brier by day,
I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,
The solitary guest from Alabama.

Blow! blow! blow!
Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok’s shore;
I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.

Yes, when the stars glisten’d,
All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop’d stake,
Down almost amid the slapping waves,
Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.

He call’d on his mate,
He pour’d forth the meanings which I of all men know.

Yes my brother I know,
The rest might not, but I have treasur’d every note,
For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,
Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,
Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts,
The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
Listen’d long and long.

Listen’d to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,
Following you my brother.

Soothe! soothe! soothe!
Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,
And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,
But my love soothes not me, not me.

Low hangs the moon, it rose late,
It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.

O madly the sea pushes upon the land,
With love, with love.

O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?
What is that little black thing I see there in the white?

Loud! loud! loud!
Loud I call to you, my love!

High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves,
Surely you must know who is here, is here,
You must know who I am, my love.

Low-hanging moon!
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!
O moon do not keep her from me any longer.

Land! land! O land!
Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again if you only would,
For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.

O rising stars!
Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.

O throat! O trembling throat!
Sound clearer through the atmosphere!
Pierce the woods, the earth,
Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.

Shake out carols!
Solitary here, the night’s carols!
Carols of lonesome love! death’s carols!
Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!
O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!
O reckless despairing carols.

But soft! sink low!
Soft! let me just murmur,
And do you wait a moment you husky-nois’d sea,
For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,
So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,
But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.

Hither my love!
Here I am! here!
With this just-sustain’d note I announce myself to you,
This gentle call is for you my love, for you.

Do not be decoy’d elsewhere,
That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,
That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,
Those are the shadows of leaves.

O darkness! O in vain!
O I am very sick and sorrowful.

O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!
O troubled reflection in the sea!
O throat! O throbbing heart!
And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night.

O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!
In the air, in the woods, over fields,
Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
But my mate no more, no more with me!
We two together no more.

The aria sinking,
All else continuing, the stars shining,
The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,
With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,
On the sands of Paumanok’s shore gray and rustling,
The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching,
The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying,
The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting,
The aria’s meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,
The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,
The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,
To the boy’s soul’s questions sullenly timing, some drown’d secret hissing,
To the outsetting bard.

Demon or bird! (said the boy’s soul,)
Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
For I, that was a child, my tongue’s use sleeping, now I have heard you,
Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,
And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours,
A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die.

O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,
O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating you,
Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,
Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night,
By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,
The messenger there arous’d, the fire, the sweet hell within,
The unknown want, the destiny of me.

O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)
O if I am to have so much, let me have more!

A word then, (for I will conquer it,)
The word final, superior to all,
Subtle, sent up—what is it?—I listen;
Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?
Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?

Whereto answering, the sea,
Delaying not, hurrying not,
Whisper’d me through the night, and very plainly before day-break,

Lisp’d to me the low and delicious word death,
And again death, death, death, death,
Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous’d child’s heart,
But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,
Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,
Death, death, death, death, death.

Which I do not forget,
But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok’s gray beach,
With the thousand responsive songs at random,
My own songs awaked from that hour,
And with them the key, the word up from the waves,
The word of the sweetest song and all songs,
That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside,)
The sea whisper’d me.",free verse,meters,"['Related Audio', 'Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Classic Love', 'First Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Relationships', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Techniques', 'Free Verse', 'Anaphora']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48858/out-of-the-cradle-endlessly-rocking,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Walt Whitman,1819–1892,Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand,"Whoever you are holding me now in hand,
Without one thing all will be useless,
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,
I am not what you supposed, but far different.

Who is he that would become my follower?
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?

The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard,
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,
The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,
Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,
Put me down and depart on your way.

Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,
Or back of a rock in the open air,
(For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,
And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)
But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,
Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,
Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,
With the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,
For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.

Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,
Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;
For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.

But these leaves conning you con at peril,
For these leaves and me you will not understand,
They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!
Already you see I have escaped from you.

For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,
Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,
Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,
Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,
Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,
For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;
Therefore release me and depart on your way.",free verse,meters,"['Love', 'Break-ups & Vexed Love', 'Classic Love', 'Desire', 'Infatuation & Crushes', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Reading & Books', 'Free Verse']","Walt Whitman, ""Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand"" from Leaves of Grass (: , )",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49204/whoever-you-are-holding-me-now-in-hand,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman,,1819.0,1892.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Alice Cary,1820–1871,To Solitude,"I am weary of the working, 
   Weary of the long day’s heat; 
To thy comfortable bosom, 
   Wilt thou take me, spirit sweet? 
 
Weary of the long, blind struggle 
   For a pathway bright and high,— 
Weary of the dimly dying 
   Hopes that never quite all die. 
 
Weary searching a bad cipher 
   For a good that must be meant; 
Discontent with being weary,— 
   Weary with my discontent. 
 
I am weary of the trusting 
   Where my trusts but torments prove; 
Wilt thou keep faith with me? wilt thou 
   Be my true and tender love? 
 
I am weary drifting, driving 
   Like a helmless bark at sea; 
Kindly, comfortable spirit, 
   Wilt thou give thyself to me? 
 
Give thy birds to sing me sonnets? 
   Give thy winds my cheeks to kiss? 
And thy mossy rocks to stand for 
   The memorials of our bliss? 
 
I in reverence will hold thee,

Though thy wild and wimpling waters 
   Wind about a thousand hills.",ode,types/modes,"['Living', 'Disappointment & Failure', 'Time & Brevity', 'Activities', 'Jobs & Working', 'Ode']","Source:

Joshua McCarter Simpson,1820–1876,"“No, Master, Never!”","Or the true feelings of those slaves who say they
  would not be free. The following shows their
              feelings when they are free.
   Air—“Pop Goes the Weasel”
Old master always said,
   Jack will never leave me:
He has a noble head, 
   He will not deceive me.
I will treat him every day
   Kindly and clever,
Then he will not run away—
   No, master, never!
One night I heard him say,
   He was going to Cleveland,
A thought struck me right away,
   That this was a free land.
I thought if I too could go,
   The dearest ties I’d sever.
And never would come back no more—
   Never! no, never!
The next morn at early dawn,
   I heard old master knocking:
He says, “Jack, we must be gone—
   Put on your shoes and stockings.”
Quickly I bounded out,
   And got my clothes together,
And told my wife I’d not come back
   No, Lizzie, never!
Soon we were on the way,
   Toward the Forest City;
There to leave my wife a slave,
   I thought it was a pity.
I heard mistress slightly say,
   We’ll all keep together,
Or Jack will go to Canada,
   No, says master, never!
Jack, says he, be wide awake,
   And let nobody tease you;
And don’t go too near the lake—
   The cold winds will freeze you!
Do you think I would run away,
   And leave a man so clever,
And seek a home in Canada?
   “No, master, never!”
We stopped at the Weddell House,
   The thought then came o’er me,
That now’s the time to go across,
   As many have gone before me.
I went down to the steamboat wharf
   Got on the Jacob Astor,
And cried aloud as she shoved off,
   Farewell, old master.
The next day, in Malden town,
   Who should I see but master,
He says, Jack, you must go home,
   You’ll starve and freeze to death sir.
Says I, you are a nice old man;
   Very kind and clever;
But think I’ll wear my chains again?

Charles Baudelaire,1821 – 1867,Be Drunk,"You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it—it's the only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk.

But on what? Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk.

And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again, drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you: ""It is time to be drunk!

Dank fens of cedar; hemlock-branches gray
With trees and trail of mosses, wringing-wet;
Beds of the black pitchpine in dead leaves set
Whose wasted red has wasted to white away;
Remnants of rain and droppings of decay, —
Why hold ye so my heart, nor dimly let
Through your deep leaves the light of yesterday,
The faded glimmer of a sunshine set?
Is it that in your darkness, shut from strife,
The bread of tears becomes the bread of life?

Fresh griefs beat tranquilly, and loves and vows
Grow green in your gray shadows, dearer far

Have natural limit; from his dread eclipse
The swift sun hastens, and the night debars
The day, but to bring in the day more bright;
The flowers renew their odorous fellowships;
The moon runs round and round; the slow earth dips,
True to her poise, and lifts; the planet-stars
Roll and return from circle to ellipse;

And Change, with hurried hand, has swept these scenes:
The woods have fallen; across the meadow-lot
The hunter’s trail and trap-path is forgot;
And fire has drunk the swamps of evergreens!
Yet for a moment let my fancy plant
These autumn hills again,—the wild dove’s haunt,
The wild deer’s walk. In golden umbrage shut,
The Indian river runs, Quonecktacut!
Here, but a lifetime back, where falls to-night
Behind the curtained pane a sheltered light
On buds of rose, or vase of violet
Aloft upon the marble mantel set,—
Here, in the forest-heart, hung blackening
The wolf-bait on the bush beside the spring.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Nature', 'Sonnet']","Source:

How oft in schoolboy-days, from the school’s sway
Have I run forth to Nature as to a friend,—
With some pretext of o’erwrought sight, to spend
My school-time in green meadows far away!
Careless of summoning bell, or clocks that strike,
I marked with flowers the minutes of my day:
For still the eye that shrank from hated hours,
Dazzled with decimal and dividend,
Knew each bleached alder-root that plashed across
The bubbling brook, and every mass of moss;
Could tell the month, too, by the vervain-spike,—
How far the ring of purple tiny flowers
Had climbed; just starting, may-be, with the May,
Half-light, or tapering off at Summer’s end.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Living', 'Coming of Age', 'Nature', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Sonnet']","Source:

Yet, even ‘mid merry boyhood’s tricks and scapes,
Early my heart a deeper lesson learnt;
Wandering alone by many a mile burnt
Black woodside, that but the snow-flake decks and drapes.
And I have stood beneath Canadian sky,
In utter solitudes, where the cricket’s cry
Appals the heart, and fear takes visible shapes;
And on Long Island’s void and isolate capes
Heard the sea break like iron bars: and still,
In all, I seemed to hear the same deep dirge;
Borne in the wind, the insect’s tiny trill,
And crash and jangle of the shaking surge;
And knew not what they meant,—prophetic woe?
Dim bodings, wherefore? Now, indeed, I know!",sonnet,verse forms,"['Living', 'Coming of Age', 'Nature', 'Philosophy', 'Sonnet']","Source:

Long curved sail needles of the green pitch pine,
With common sandgrass, skirt the horizon line,

All world asperities, lightly touched and smoothed
As by his gracious hand, the great Bestower.

Yet through the dry, some links of melody.

How well do I recall that walk in state
Across the Common, by the paths we knew:
Myself in silver badge and riband blue,
My little sister with her book and slate;

The burial place that at the corner stood
Where once we crossed, through the forbidden grate,
The stones that grudg’d us way, the graveside weed,
The ominous wind that turned us half about.
Smit the flying drops, at what a speed
Across the paths, unblessed and unforgiven

Unheard all day, ascends again; 
Deserted is the half-mown plain, 
Silent the swaths! the ringing wain, 
The mower's cry, the dog's alarms, 
All housed within the sleeping farms! 
The business of the day is done, 
The last-left haymaker is gone. 
And from the thyme upon the height, 
And from the elder-blossom white 
And pale dog-roses in the hedge, 
And from the mint-plant in the sedge, 
In puffs of balm the night-air blows 
The perfume which the day forgoes.

See, pulsing with the first-born star, 
The liquid sky above the hill!

       With saunter, with bounds— 
       Flickering and circling 
       In files and in rounds—

       Loose o'er their shoulders white 
       Showering their hair— 
       See! the wild Maenads 
       Break from the wood, 
       Youth and Iacchus 
       Maddening their blood. 
 
       See! through the quiet land 
       Rioting they pass— 
       Fling the fresh heaps about, 
       Trample the grass. 
       Tear from the rifled hedge 
       Garlands, their prize; 
       Fill with their sports the field, 
       Fill with their cries.

       Forth with thy joyous song! 
       Forth with thy flute!

       Lure not their cries? 
       Glow not their shoulders smooth?

The epoch ends, the world is still. 
The age has talk'd and work'd its fill— 
The famous orators have shone, 
The famous poets sung and gone, 
The famous men of war have fought, 
The famous speculators thought, 
The famous players, sculptors, wrought, 
The famous painters fill'd their wall, 
The famous critics judged it all. 
The combatants are parted now— 
Uphung the spear, unbent the bow, 
The puissant crown'd, the weak laid low. 
And in the after-silence sweet, 
Now strifes are hush'd, our ears doth meet, 
Ascending pure, the bell-like fame 
Of this or that down-trodden name, 
Delicate spirits, push'd away 
In the hot press of the noon-day. 
And o'er the plain, where the dead age 
Did its now silent warfare wage— 
O'er that wide plain, now wrapt in gloom, 
Where many a splendour finds its tomb, 
Many spent fames and fallen mights— 
The one or two immortal lights 
Rise slowly up into the sky 
To shine there everlastingly, 
Like stars over the bounding hill. 
The epoch ends, the world is still. 
 
       Thundering and bursting 
       In torrents, in waves— 
       Carolling and shouting 
       Over tombs, amid graves— 
       See! on the cumber'd plain 
       Clearing a stage, 
       Scattering the past about, 
       Comes the new age. 
       Bards make new poems, 
       Thinkers new schools, 
       Statesmen new systems, 
       Critics new rules. 
       All things begin again; 
       Life is their prize; 
       Earth with their deeds they fill, 
       Fill with their cries. 
 
       Poet, what ails thee, then? 
       Say, why so mute? 
       Forth with thy praising voice! 
       Forth with thy flute! 
       Loiterer! why sittest thou 
       Sunk in thy dream? 
       Tempts not the bright new age? 
       Shines not its stream? 
       Look, ah, what genius, 
       Art, science, wit! 
       Soldiers like Caesar, 
       Statesmen like Pitt! 
       Sculptors like Phidias, 
       Raphaels in shoals, 
       Poets like Shakespeare— 
       Beautiful souls! 
       See, on their glowing cheeks 
       Heavenly the flush! 
        —Ah, so the silence was! 
       So was the hush! 
 
The world but feels the present's spell,

Matthew Arnold,1822–1888,Youth and Calm,"Tis death! and peace, indeed, is here,
And ease from shame, and rest from fear.
There's nothing can dismarble now
The smoothness of that limpid brow.
But is a calm like this, in truth,
The crowning end of life and youth,
And when this boon rewards the dead,
Are all debts paid, has all been said?
And is the heart of youth so light,
Its step so firm, its eye so bright,
Because on its hot brow there blows
A wind of promise and repose
From the far grave, to which it goes;
Because it hath the hope to come,
One day, to harbour in the tomb?
Ah no, the bliss youth dreams is one
For daylight, for the cheerful sun,
For feeling nerves and living breath—
Youth dreams a bliss on this side death.
It dreams a rest, if not more deep,
More grateful than this marble sleep;
It hears a voice within it tell:
Calm's not life's crown, though calm is well.
'Tis all perhaps which man acquires,
But 'tis not what our youth desires.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Growing Old', 'Time & Brevity', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43611/youth-and-calm,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/matthew-arnold,,1822.0,1888.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Matthew Arnold,1822–1888,The Buried Life,"Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves—and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!—doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?—must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be—
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity—
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us—to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves—
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well—but 't is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only—but this is rare—
When a belovèd hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd—
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.",ode,types/modes,"['Living', 'Time & Brevity', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Ode', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43585/the-buried-life,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/matthew-arnold,,1822.0,1888.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Matthew Arnold,1822–1888,Rugby Chapel,"Coldly, sadly descends
The autumn-evening. The field
Strewn with its dank yellow drifts
Of wither'd leaves, and the elms,
Fade into dimness apace,
Silent;—hardly a shout
From a few boys late at their play!
The lights come out in the street,
In the school-room windows;—but cold,
Solemn, unlighted, austere,
Through the gathering darkness, arise
The chapel-walls, in whose bound
Thou, my father! art laid.

There thou dost lie, in the gloom
Of the autumn evening. But ah!
That word, gloom, to my mind
Brings thee back, in the light
Of thy radiant vigour, again;
In the gloom of November we pass'd
Days not dark at thy side;
Seasons impair'd not the ray
Of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear.
Such thou wast! and I stand
In the autumn evening, and think
Of bygone autumns with thee.

Fifteen years have gone round
Since thou arosest to tread,
In the summer-morning, the road
Of death, at a call unforeseen,
Sudden. For fifteen years,
We who till then in thy shade
Rested as under the boughs
Of a mighty oak, have endured
Sunshine and rain as we might,
Bare, unshaded, alone,
Lacking the shelter of thee.

O strong soul, by what shore
Tarriest thou now? For that force,
Surely, has not been left vain!
Somewhere, surely afar,
In the sounding labour-house vast
Of being, is practised that strength,
Zealous, beneficent, firm!

Yes, in some far-shining sphere,
Conscious or not of the past,
Still thou performest the word
Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live—
Prompt, unwearied, as here!
Still thou upraisest with zeal
The humble good from the ground,
Sternly repressest the bad!
Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse
Those who with half-open eyes
Tread the border-land dim
'Twixt vice and virtue; reviv'st,
Succourest!—this was thy work,
This was thy life upon earth.

What is the course of the life
Of mortal men on the earth?—
Most men eddy about
Here and there—eat and drink,
Chatter and love and hate,
Gather and squander, are raised
Aloft, are hurl'd in the dust,
Striving blindly, achieving
Nothing; and then they die—
Perish;—and no one asks
Who or what they have been,
More than he asks what waves,
In the moonlit solitudes mild
Of the midmost Ocean, have swell'd,
Foam'd for a moment, and gone.

And there are some, whom a thirst
Ardent, unquenchable, fires,
Not with the crowd to be spent,
Not without aim to go round
In an eddy of purposeless dust,
Effort unmeaning and vain.
Ah yes! some of us strive
Not without action to die
Fruitless, but something to snatch
From dull oblivion, nor all
Glut the devouring grave!
We, we have chosen our path—
Path to a clear-purposed goal,
Path of advance!—but it leads
A long, steep journey, through sunk
Gorges, o'er mountains in snow.
Cheerful, with friends, we set forth—
Then on the height, comes the storm.
Thunder crashes from rock
To rock, the cataracts reply,
Lightnings dazzle our eyes.
Roaring torrents have breach'd
The track, the stream-bed descends
In the place where the wayfarer once
Planted his footstep—the spray
Boils o'er its borders! aloft
The unseen snow-beds dislodge
Their hanging ruin; alas,
Havoc is made in our train!
Friends, who set forth at our side,
Falter, are lost in the storm.
We, we only are left!
With frowning foreheads, with lips
Sternly compress'd, we strain on,
On—and at nightfall at last
Come to the end of our way,
To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks;
Where the gaunt and taciturn host
Stands on the threshold, the wind
Shaking his thin white hairs—
Holds his lantern to scan
Our storm-beat figures, and asks:
Whom in our party we bring?
Whom we have left in the snow?
Sadly we answer: We bring
Only ourselves! we lost
Sight of the rest in the storm.
Hardly ourselves we fought through,
Stripp'd, without friends, as we are.
Friends, companions, and train,
The avalanche swept from our side.

But thou woulds't not alone
Be saved, my father! alone
Conquer and come to thy goal,
Leaving the rest in the wild.
We were weary, and we
Fearful, and we in our march
Fain to drop down and to die.
Still thou turnedst, and still
Beckonedst the trembler, and still
Gavest the weary thy hand.

If, in the paths of the world,
Stones might have wounded thy feet,
Toil or dejection have tried
Thy spirit, of that we saw
Nothing—to us thou wage still
Cheerful, and helpful, and firm!
Therefore to thee it was given
Many to save with thyself;
And, at the end of thy day,
O faithful shepherd! to come,
Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.

And through thee I believe
In the noble and great who are gone;
Pure souls honour'd and blest
By former ages, who else—
Such, so soulless, so poor,
Is the race of men whom I see—
Seem'd but a dream of the heart,
Seem'd but a cry of desire.
Yes! I believe that there lived
Others like thee in the past,
Not like the men of the crowd
Who all round me to-day
Bluster or cringe, and make life
Hideous, and arid, and vile;
But souls temper'd with fire,
Fervent, heroic, and good,
Helpers and friends of mankind.
Servants of God!—or sons
Shall I not call you? Because
Not as servants ye knew
Your Father's innermost mind,
His, who unwillingly sees
One of his little ones lost—
Yours is the praise, if mankind
Hath not as yet in its march
Fainted, and fallen, and died!

See! In the rocks of the world
Marches the host of mankind,
A feeble, wavering line.
Where are they tending?—A God
Marshall'd them, gave them their goal.
Ah, but the way is so long!
Years they have been in the wild!
Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks
Rising all round, overawe;
Factions divide them, their host
Threatens to break, to dissolve.
—Ah, keep, keep them combined!
Else, of the myriads who fill
That army, not one shall arrive;
Sole they shall stray; in the rocks
Stagger for ever in vain,
Die one by one in the waste.

Then, in such hour of need
Of your fainting, dispirited race,
Ye, like angels, appear,
Radiant with ardour divine!
Beacons of hope, ye appear!
Languor is not in your heart,
Weakness is not in your word,
Weariness not on your brow.
Ye alight in our van! at your voice,
Panic, despair, flee away.
Ye move through the ranks, recall
The stragglers, refresh the outworn,
Praise, re-inspire the brave!
Order, courage, return.
Eyes rekindling, and prayers,
Follow your steps as ye go.
Ye fill up the gaps in our files,
Strengthen the wavering line,
Stablish, continue our march,

The Adriatic breaks in a warm bay 
Among the green Illyrian hills; and there 
The sunshine in the happy glens is fair, 
And by the sea, and in the brakes. 
The grass is cool, the sea-side air 
Buoyant and fresh, the mountain flowers 
More virginal and sweet than ours. 
 
And there, they say, two bright and aged snakes, 
Who once were Cadmus and Harmonia, 
Bask in the glens or on the warm sea-shore, 
In breathless quiet, after all their ills; 
Nor do they see their country, nor the place 
Where the Sphinx lived among the frowning hills, 
Nor the unhappy palace of their race, 
Nor Thebes, nor the Ismenus, any more. 
 
There those two live, far in the Illyrian brakes! 
They had stay'd long enough to see, 
In Thebes, the billow of calamity 
Over their own dear children roll'd, 
Curse upon curse, pang upon pang, 
For years, they sitting helpless in their home, 
A grey old man and woman; yet of old 
The Gods had to their marriage come, 
And at the banquet all the Muses sang. 
 
Therefore they did not end their days 
In sight of blood, but were rapt, far away, 
To where the west-wind plays, 
And murmurs of the Adriatic come 
To those untrodden mountain-lawns; and there 
Placed safely in changed forms, the pair

Matthew Arnold,1822–1888,Mycerinus,"""Not by the justice that my father spurn'd,
Not for the thousands whom my father slew,
Altars unfed and temples overturn'd,
Cold hearts and thankless tongues, where thanks are due;
Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie,
Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny.

 ""I will unfold my sentence and my crime.
My crime—that, rapt in reverential awe,
I sate obedient, in the fiery prime
Of youth, self-govern'd, at the feet of Law;
Ennobling this dull pomp, the life of kings,
By contemplation of diviner things.

 ""My father loved injustice, and lived long;
Crown'd with grey hairs he died, and full of sway.
I loved the good he scorn'd, and hated wrong—
The Gods declare my recompense to-day.
I look'd for life more lasting, rule more high;
And when six years are measured, lo, I die!

 ""Yet surely, O my people, did I deem
Man's justice from the all-just Gods was given;
A light that from some upper fount did beam,
Some better archetype, whose seat was heaven;
A light that, shining from the blest abodes,
Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods.

 ""Mere phantoms of man's self-tormenting heart,
Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed!
Vain dreams, which quench our pleasures, then depart
When the duped soul, self-master'd, claims its meed;
When, on the strenuous just man, Heaven bestows,
Crown of his struggling life, an unjust close!

 ""Seems it so light a thing, then, austere Powers,
To spurn man's common lure, life's pleasant things?
Seems there no joy in dances crown'd with flowers,
Love, free to range, and regal banquetings?
Bend ye on these, indeed, an unmoved eye,
Not Gods but ghosts, in frozen apathy?

 ""Or is it that some Force, too wise, too strong,
Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile,
Sweeps earth, and heaven, and men, and Gods along,
Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile?
And the great powers we serve, themselves may be
Slaves of a tyrannous necessity?

 ""Or in mid-heaven, perhaps, your golden cars,
Where earthly voice climbs never, wing their flight,
And in wild hunt, through mazy tracts of stars,
Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night?
Or in deaf ease, on thrones of dazzling sheen,
Drinking deep draughts of joy, ye dwell serene?

 ""Oh, wherefore cheat our youth, if thus it be,
Of one short joy, one lust, one pleasant dream?
Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see,
Blind divinations of a will supreme;
Lost labour! when the circumambient gloom
But hides, if Gods, Gods careless of our doom?

 ""The rest I give to joy. Even while I speak,
My sand runs short; and—as yon star-shot ray,
Hemm'd by two banks of cloud, peers pale and weak,
Now, as the barrier closes, dies away—
Even so do past and future intertwine,
Blotting this six years' space, which yet is mine.

 ""Six years—six little years—six drops of time!
Yet suns shall rise, and many moons shall wane,
And old men die, and young men pass their prime,
And languid pleasure fade and flower again,
And the dull Gods behold, ere these are flown,
Revels more deep, joy keener than their own.

 ""Into the silence of the groves and woods
I will go forth; though something would I say—
Something—yet what, I know not; for the Gods
The doom they pass revoke not, nor delay;
And prayers, and gifts, and tears, are fruitless all,
And the night waxes, and the shadows fall.

 ""Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king!
I go, and I return not. But the will
Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring
Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil
Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,
The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days.""

 —So spake he, half in anger, half in scorn;
And one loud cry of grief and of amaze
Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake,
And turning, left them there; and with brief pause,
Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way
To the cool region of the groves he loved.
There by the river-banks he wander'd on,
From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,
Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath
Burying their unsunn'd stems in grass and flowers;
Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy
Might wander all day long and never tire.
Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn,
Rose-crown'd; and ever, when the sun went down,
A hundred lamps beam'd in the tranquil gloom,
From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove,
Revealing all the tumult of the feast—
Flush'd guests, and golden goblets foam'd with wine;
While the deep-burnish'd foliage overhead
Splinter'd the silver arrows of the moon.

    It may be that sometimes his wondering soul
From the loud joyful laughter of his lips
Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man
Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape
Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems,
Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl,
Whispering: A little space, and thou art mine!
It may be on that joyless feast his eye
Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within,
Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength,
And by that silent knowledge, day by day,
Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd.
It may be; but not less his brow was smooth,
And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom,
And his mirth quail'd not at the mild reproof
Sigh'd out by winter's sad tranquillity;
Nor, pall'd with its own fulness, ebb'd and died
In the rich languor of long summer-days;
Nor wither'd when the palm-tree plumes, that roof'd
With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall,
Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring;
No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds.

    So six long years he revell'd, night and day.
And when the mirth wax'd loudest, with dull sound
Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came,
To tell his wondering people of their king;
In the still night, across the steaming flats,
Mix'd with the murmur of the moving Nile.",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Living', 'Time & Brevity', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Religion', 'Faith & Doubt', 'Other Religions', 'Dramatic Monologue', 'Allusion', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43596/mycerinus,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/matthew-arnold,,1822.0,1888.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Matthew Arnold,1822–1888,Memorial Verses April 1850,"Goethe in Weimar sleeps, and Greece,
Long since, saw Byron's struggle cease.
But one such death remain'd to come;
The last poetic voice is dumb—
We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb.

When Byron's eyes were shut in death,
We bow'd our head and held our breath.
He taught us little; but our soul
Had felt him like the thunder's roll.
With shivering heart the strife we saw
Of passion with eternal law;
And yet with reverential awe
We watch'd the fount of fiery life
Which served for that Titanic strife.

    When Goethe's death was told, we said:
Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head.
Physician of the iron age,
Goethe has done his pilgrimage.
He took the suffering human race,
He read each wound, each weakness clear;
And struck his finger on the place,
And said: Thou ailest here, and here!

He look'd on Europe's dying hour
Of fitful dream and feverish power;
His eye plunged down the weltering strife,
The turmoil of expiring life—
He said: The end is everywhere,
Art still has truth, take refuge there!
And he was happy, if to know
Causes of things, and far below
His feet to see the lurid flow
Of terror, and insane distress,
And headlong fate, be happiness.

And Wordsworth!—Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice!
For never has such soothing voice
Been to your shadowy world convey'd,
Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade
Heard the clear song of Orpheus come
Through Hades, and the mournful gloom.
Wordsworth has gone from us—and ye,
Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!
He too upon a wintry clime
Had fallen—on this iron time
Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears.
He found us when the age had bound
Our souls in its benumbing round;
He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.
He laid us as we lay at birth
On the cool flowery lap of earth,
Smiles broke from us and we had ease;

The hills were round us, and the breeze
Went o'er the sun-lit fields again;
Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.
Our youth return'd; for there was shed
On spirits that had long been dead,
Spirits dried up and closely furl'd,
The freshness of the early world.

Ah! since dark days still bring to light
Man's prudence and man's fiery might,
Time may restore us in his course
Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;
But where will Europe's latter hour
Again find Wordsworth's healing power?
Others will teach us how to dare,
And against fear our breast to steel;
Others will strengthen us to bear—
But who, ah! who, will make us feel?
The cloud of mortal destiny,
Others will front it fearlessly—
But who, like him, will put it by?

He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;
But when the grey dawn stole into his tent,
He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,
And took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,
And went abroad into the cold wet fog,
Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent.

    Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood
Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand
Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow
When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;
Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,
And to a hillock came, a little back
From the stream's brink—the spot where first a boat,
Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.
The men of former times had crown'd the top
With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now
The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,
A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread.
And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood
Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,
And found the old man sleeping on his bed
Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.
And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step
Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;
And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:—

    ""Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.
Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?""

    But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:—
""Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.
The sun is not yet risen, and the foe
Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie
Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.
For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek
Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,
In Samarcand, before the army march'd;
And I will tell thee what my heart desires.
Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first
I came among the Tartars and bore arms,
I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,
At my boy's years, the courage of a man.
This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on
The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,
And beat the Persians back on every field,
I seek one man, one man, and one alone—
Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,
Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,
His not unworthy, not inglorious son.
So I long hoped, but him I never find.
Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.
Let the two armies rest to-day; but I
Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords
To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,
Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall—
Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.
Dim is the rumour of a common fight,
Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;
But of a single combat fame speaks clear.""

    He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand
Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:—

    ""O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!
Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,
And share the battle's common chance with us
Who love thee, but must press for ever first,
In single fight incurring single risk,
To find a father thou hast never seen?
That were far best, my son, to stay with us
Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,
And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns.
But, if this one desire indeed rules all,
To seek out Rustum—seek him not through fight!
Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,
O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!
But far hence seek him, for he is not here.
For now it is not as when I was young,
When Rustum was in front of every fray;
But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,
In Seistan, with Zal, his father old.
Whether that his own mighty strength at last
Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,
Or in some quarrel with the Persian King.
There go!—Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes
Danger or death awaits thee on this field.
Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost
To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace
To seek thy father, not seek single fights
In vain;—but who can keep the lion's cub
From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?
Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.""

    So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left
His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;
And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat
He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,
And threw a white cloak round him, and he took
In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword;
And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,
Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;
And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd
His herald to his side, and went abroad.

    The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog
From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.
And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed
Into the open plain; so Haman bade—
Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled
The host, and still was in his lusty prime.
From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;
As when some grey November morn the files,
In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes
Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes
Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,
Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound
For the warm Persian sea-board—so they stream'd.
The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,
First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;
Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come
And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.
Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,
The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,
And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;
Light men and on light steeds, who only drink
The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.
And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came
From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;
The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks
Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards
And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes
Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,
Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray
Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,
Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;
These all filed out from camp into the plain.
And on the other side the Persians form'd;—
First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd,
The Ilyats of Khorassan, and behind,
The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,
Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.
But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,
Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,
And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.
And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw
That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,
He took his spear, and to the front he came,
And check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood.
And the old Tartar came upon the sand
Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:—

    ""Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!
Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.
But choose a champion from the Persian lords
To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.""

    As, in the country, on a morn in June,
When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,
A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy—
So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,
A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran
Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.

    But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,
Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,
That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;
Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass
Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,
Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves
Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries—
In single file they move, and stop their breath,
For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows—
So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.

    And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up
To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,
And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host
Second, and was the uncle of the King;
These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:—

    ""Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,
Yet champion have we none to match this youth.
He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.
But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits
And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart.
Him will I seek, and carry to his ear
The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name.
Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight.
Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up.""

    So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:—
""Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!
Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.""

    He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode
Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.
But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,
And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,
Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents.
Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,
Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst
Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around.
And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found
Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still
The table stood before him, charged with food—
A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,
And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate
Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,
And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood
Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,
And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,
And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:—

    ""Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.
What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink.""

    But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:—
""Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,
But not to-day; to-day has other needs.
The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;
For from the Tartars is a challenge brought
To pick a champion from the Persian lords
To fight their champion—and thou know'st his name—
Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid.
O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!
He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;
And he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old,
Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.
Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!''

    He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:—
""Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I
Am older; if the young are weak, the King
Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,
Himself is young, and honours younger men,
And lets the aged moulder to their graves.
Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young—
The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I.
For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?
For would that I myself had such a son,
And not that one slight helpless girl I have—
A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,
And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,
My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,
And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,
And he has none to guard his weak old age.
There would I go, and hang my armour up,
And with my great name fence that weak old man,
And spend the goodly treasures I have got,
And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,
And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,
And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.''

    He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:—
""What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,
When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks
Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,
Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:
Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,
And shuns to peril it with younger men.""

    And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:—
""O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?
Thou knowest better words than this to say.
What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,
Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?
Are not they mortal, am not I myself?
But who for men of nought would do great deeds?
Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!
But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;
Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd
In single fight with any mortal man.""

    He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran
Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy—
Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.
But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd
His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,
And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose
Were plain, and on his shield was no device,
Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,
And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume
Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.
So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,
Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel—
Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,
The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once
Did in Bokhara by the river find
A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,
And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,
Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green
Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd
All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.
So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd
The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd.
And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts
Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.
And dear as the wet diver to the eyes
Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,
By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,
Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,
Having made up his tale of precious pearls,
Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands—
So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.

    And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,
And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came.
And as afield the reapers cut a swath
Down through the middle of a rich man's corn,
And on each side are squares of standing corn,
And in the midst a stubble, short and bare—
So on each side were squares of men, with spears
Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand.
And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast
His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw
Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.

    As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,
Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge
Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire—
At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,
When the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes—
And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts
Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed
The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar
Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth
All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused
His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was.
For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;
Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,
Which in a queen's secluded garden throws
Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,
By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound—
So slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd.
And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul
As he beheld him coming; and he stood,
And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:—

    ""O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,
And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!
Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.
Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,
And tried; and I have stood on many a field
Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe—
Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.
O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?
Be govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come
To Iran, and be as my son to me,
And fight beneath my banner till I die!
There are no youths in Iran brave as thou.""

    So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,
The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw
His giant figure planted on the sand,
Sole, like some single tower, which a chief
Hath builded on the waste in former years
Against the robbers; and he saw that head,
Streak'd with its first grey hairs;—hope filled his soul,
And he ran forward and embraced his knees,
And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:—

    ""O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul!
Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?""

    But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,
And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:—

    ""Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!
False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.
For if I now confess this thing he asks,
And hide it not, but say: Rustum is here!
He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,
But he will find some pretext not to fight,
And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts,
A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.
And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,
In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:
'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd
Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords
To cope with me in single fight; but they
Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I
Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.'
So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;
Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.""

    And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:—
""Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus
Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd
By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!
Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?
Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee!
For well I know, that did great Rustum stand
Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,
There would be then no talk of fighting more.
But being what I am, I tell thee this—
Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:
Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,
Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds
Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,
Oxus in summer wash them all away.""

    He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:—
""Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so!
I am no girl, to be made pale by words.
Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand
Here on this field, there were no fighting then.
But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.
Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,
And thou art proved, I know, and I am young—
But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.
And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure
Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.
For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,
Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,
Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.
And whether it will heave us up to land,
Or whether it will roll us out to sea,
Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,
We know not, and no search will make us know;
Only the event will teach us in its hour.""

    He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd
His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,
As on some partridge in the corn a hawk,
That long has tower'd in the airy clouds,
Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,
And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear
Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,
Which it sent flying wide;—then Sohrab threw
In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,
The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear.
And Rustum seized his club, which none but he
Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,
Still rough—like those which men in treeless plains
To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,
Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up
By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time
Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,
And strewn the channels with torn boughs—so huge
The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck
One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,
Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came
Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.
And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell
To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;
And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,
And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay
Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;
But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,
But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:—

    ""Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float
Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones.
But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;
No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.
Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!
Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?
Boy as I am, I have seen battles too—
Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,
And heard their hollow roar of dying men;
But never was my heart thus touch'd before.
Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?
O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!
Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,
And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,
And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,
And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.
There are enough foes in the Persian host,
Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;
Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou
Mayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear!
But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!""

    He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,
And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club
He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,
Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand
Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,
The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd
His stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms.
His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice
Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:—

    ""Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!
Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!
Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!
Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now
With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;
But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance
Of battle, and with me, who make no play
Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.
Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!
Remember all thy valour; try thy feints
And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;
Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts
With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.""

    He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,
And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd
Together, as two eagles on one prey
Come rushing down together from the clouds,
One from the east, one from the west; their shields
Dash'd with a clang together, and a din
Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters
Make often in the forest's heart at morn,
Of hewing axes, crashing trees—such blows
Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.
And you would say that sun and stars took part
In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud
Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun
Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose
Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,
And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.
In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;
For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,
And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.
But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes
And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield
Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,
And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.
Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,
Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,
Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;
And Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom
Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,
And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,
Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;—
No horse's cry was that, most like the roar
Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day
Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,
And comes at night to die upon the sand.
The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,
And Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream.
But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,
And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd
His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,
Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,
And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.
Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes
Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,
And shouted: Rustum!—Sohrab heard that shout,
And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,
And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form,
And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd
His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.
He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;
And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,
And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all
The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair—
Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,
And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.

    Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:—
""Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill
A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,
And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.
Or else that the great Rustum would come down
Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move
His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.
And then that all the Tartar host would praise
Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,
To glad thy father in his weak old age.
Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!
Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be
Than to thy friends, and to thy father old.""

    And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:—
""Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.
Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!
No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.
For were I match'd with ten such men as thee,
And I were that which till to-day I was,
They should be lying here, I standing there.
But that belovéd name unnerved my arm—
That name, and something, I confess, in thee,
Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield
Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.
And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.
But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!
My father, whom I seek through all the world,
He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!""

    As when some hunter in the spring hath found
A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,
Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,
And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,
And follow'd her to find her where she fell
Far off;—anon her mate comes winging back
From hunting, and a great way off descries
His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks
His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps
Circles above his eyry, with loud screams
Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,
In some far stony gorge out of his ken,
A heap of fluttering feathers—never more
Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;
Never the black and dripping precipices
Echo her stormy scream as she sails by—
As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,
So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood
Over his dying son, and knew him not.

    But, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:—
""What prate is this of fathers and revenge?
The mighty Rustum never had a son.""

    And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:—
""Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.
Surely the news will one day reach his ear,
Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,
Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;
And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap
To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.
Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!
What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?
Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!
Yet him I pity not so much, but her,
My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells
With that old king, her father, who grows grey
With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.
Her most I pity, who no more will see
Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,
With spoils and honour, when the war is done.
But a dark rumour will be bruited up,
From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;
And then will that defenceless woman learn
That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,
But that in battle with a nameless foe,
By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.""

    He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,
Thinking of her he left, and his own death.
He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought.
Nor did he yet believe it was his son
Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;
For he had had sure tidings that the babe,
Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,
Had been a puny girl, no boy at all—
So that sad mother sent him word, for fear
Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.
And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,
By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;
Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.
So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought
And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide
Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore
At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;
For he remember'd his own early youth,
And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,
The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,
Through many rolling clouds—so Rustum saw
His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;
And that old king, her father, who loved well
His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child
With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,
They three, in that long-distant summer-time—
The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt
And hound, and morn on those delightful hills
In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,
Of age and looks to be his own dear son,
Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,
Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,
Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,
And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,
On the mown, dying grass—so Sohrab lay,
Lovely in death, upon the common sand.
And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:—

    ""O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son
Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!
Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men
Have told thee false—thou art not Rustum's son.
For Rustum had no son; one child he had—
But one—a girl; who with her mother now
Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us—
Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.""

    But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now
The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,
And he desired to draw forth the steel,
And let the blood flow free, and so to die—
But first he would convince his stubborn foe;
And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:—

    ""Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?
Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,
And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.
I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear
That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,
That she might prick it on the babe she bore.""

    He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,
And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand
Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,
That the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;
And to his heart he press'd the other hand,
And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:—

    ""Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!
If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.""

    Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed
His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,
And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points
Prick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,
Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,
An emperor's gift—at early morn he paints,
And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp
Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands—
So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd
On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.
It was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,
Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,
A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;
Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved—
Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.
And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,
And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,
And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:—

    ""How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign
Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?""

    He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood
Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:
O boy—thy father!—and his voice choked there.
And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,
And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.
But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast
His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,
And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,
Trying to call him back to life; and life
Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,
And they stood wide with horror; and he seized
In both his hands the dust which lay around,
And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,—
His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;
And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,
And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,
To draw it, and for ever let life out.
But Sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands
And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:—

    ""Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day
The doom which at my birth was written down
In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.
Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,
When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,
I know it! but fate trod those promptings down
Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged
The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.
But let us speak no more of this! I find
My father; let me feel that I have found!
Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take
My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,
And wash them with thy tears, and say: My son!
Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,
And swift; for like the lightning to this field
I came, and like the wind I go away—
Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.
But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.""

    So said he, and his voice released the heart
Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast
His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,
And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,
When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,
With his head bowing to the ground and mane
Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe
First to the one then to the other moved
His head, as if enquiring what their grief
Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,
The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand.
But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:—

    ""Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet
Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,
Or ere they brought thy master to this field!""

    But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;—
""Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days
My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,
My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,
That I should one day find thy lord and thee.
Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!
O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;
For thou has gone where I shall never go,
And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.
And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,
And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake
Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself
Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,
Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,
And said; O Ruksh! bear Rustrum well!—but I
Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,
Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,
Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;
But lodged among my father's foes, and seen
Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,
Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,
And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk
The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,
Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,
The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,
The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.""

    Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:—
""Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!
Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt
Roll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!""

    But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:—
""Desire not that, my father! thou must live.
For some are born to do great deeds, and live,
As some are born to be obscured, and die.
Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,
And reap a second glory in thine age;
Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.
But come! thou seest this great host of men
Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!
Let me entreat for them; what have they done?
They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star.
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.
But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,
But carry me with thee to Seistan,
And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,
Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends.
And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,
And heap a stately mound above my bones,
And plant a far-seen pillar over all.
That so the passing horseman on the waste
May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:
Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,
Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!
And I be not forgotten in my grave.""

    And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:—
""Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,
So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,
And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,
And carry thee away to Seistan,
And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,
With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.
And I will lay thee in the lovely earth,
And heap a stately mound above thy bones,
And plant a far-seen pillar over all,
And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.
And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
What should I do with slaying any more?
For would that all whom I have ever slain
Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,
And they who were call'd champions in their time,
And through whose death I won that fame I have—
And I were nothing but a common man,
A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,
So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!
Or rather would that I, even I myself,
Might now be lying on this bloody sand,
Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,
Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;
And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;
And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;
And say: O son, I weep thee not too sore,
For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!
But now in blood and battles was my youth,
And full of blood and battles is my age,
And I shall never end this life of blood.""

    Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:—
""A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!
But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,
Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,
When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,
Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,
Returning home over the salt blue sea,
From laying thy dear master in his grave.""

    And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:—
""Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!
Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.""

    He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took
The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased
His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood
Came welling from the open gash, and life
Flow'd with the stream;—all down his cold white side
The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,
Like the soil'd tissue of white violets
Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,
By children whom their nurses call with haste
Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,
His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay—
White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,
Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,
Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them,
And fix'd them feebly on his father's face;
Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs
Unwillingly the spirit fled away,
Regretting the warm mansion which it left,
And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.

    So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;
And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak
Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.
As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd
By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear
His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps
Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side—
So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.

    And night came down over the solemn waste,
And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,
And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,
Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,
As of a great assembly loosed, and fires
Began to twinkle through the fog; for now
Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;
The Persians took it on the open sands
Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;
And Rustum and his son were left alone.

    But the majestic river floated on,
Out of the mist and hum of that low land,
Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,
Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,
Under the solitary moon;—he flow'd
Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,
Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin
To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,
And split his currents; that for many a league
The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along
Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles—
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had
In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,
A foil'd circuitous wanderer—till at last
The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide
His luminous home of waters opens, bright
And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars
Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.",free verse,meters,"['Relationships', 'Friends & Enemies', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Religion', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Free Verse']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43604/sohrab-and-rustum,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/matthew-arnold,,1822.0,1888.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Phoebe Cary,1824–1871,A Leak in the Dike,"A Story of Holland

The good dame looked from her cottage 
      At the close of the pleasant day, 
And cheerily called to her little son 
      Outside the door at play: 
“Come, Peter, come! I want you to go, 
      While there is light to see, 
To the hut of the blind old man who lives 
      Across the dike, for me; 
And take these cakes I made for him— 
      They are hot and smoking yet; 
You have time enough to go and come 
      Before the sun is set.” 
 
Then the good-wife turned to her labor, 
      Humming a simple song, 
And thought of her husband, working hard 
      At the sluices all day long; 
And set the turf a-blazing, 
      And brought the coarse black bread; 
That he might find a fire at night, 
      And find the table spread. 
 
And Peter left the brother, 
      With whom all day he had played, 
And the sister who had watched their sports 
      In the willow’s tender shade; 
And told them they ’d see him back before 
      They saw a star in sight, 
Though he would n’t be afraid to go 
      In the very darkest night! 
For he was a brave, bright fellow, 
      With eye and conscience clear; 
He could do whatever a boy might do, 
      And he had not learned to fear. 
Why, he would n’t have robbed a bird’s nest, 
      Nor brought a stork to harm, 
Though never a law in Holland 
      Had stood to stay his arm! 
 
And now, with his face all glowing, 
      And eyes as bright as the day 
With the thoughts of his pleasant errand, 
      He trudged along the way; 
And soon his joyous prattle 
      Made glad a lonesome place— 
Alas! if only the blind old man 
      Could have seen that happy face! 
Yet he somehow caught the brightness 
      Which his voice and presence lent; 
And he felt the sunshine come and go 
      As Peter came and went. 
 
And now, as the day was sinking, 
      And the winds began to rise, 
The mother looked from her door again, 
      Shading her anxious eyes; 
And saw the shadows deepen 
      And birds to their homes come back, 
But never a sign of Peter 
      Along the level track. 
But she said: “He will come at morning, 
      So I need not fret or grieve— 
Though it is n’t like my boy at all 
      To stay without my leave.” 
 
But where was the child delaying? 
      On the homeward way was he, 
And across the dike while the sun was up 
      An hour above the sea. 
He was stopping now to gather flowers, 
      Now listening to the sound, 
As the angry waters dashed themselves 
      Against their narrow bound. 
“Ah! well for us,” said Peter, 
      “That the gates are good and strong, 
And my father tends them carefully, 
      Or they would not hold you long! 
You ’re a wicked sea,” said Peter; 
      “I know why you fret and chafe; 
You would like to spoil our lands and homes; 
      But our sluices keep you safe!” 
 
But hark! Through the noise of waters 
      Comes a low, clear, trickling sound; 
And the child’s face pales with terror, 
      And his blossoms drop to the ground. 
He is up the bank in a moment, 
      And, stealing through the sand, 
He sees a stream not yet so large 
      As his slender, childish hand. 
’T is a leak in the dike! He is but a boy, 
      Unused to fearful scenes; 
But, young as he is, he has learned to know 
      The dreadful thing that means. 
A leak in the dike! The stoutest heart 
      Grows faint that cry to hear, 
And the bravest man in all the land 
      Turns white with mortal fear. 
For he knows the smallest leak may grow 
      To a flood in a single night; 
And he knows the strength of the cruel sea 
      When loosed in its angry might. 
 
And the boy! He has seen the danger, 
      And, shouting a wild alarm, 
He forces back the weight of the sea 
      With the strength of his single arm! 
He listens for the joyful sound 
      Of a footstep passing nigh; 
And lays his ear to the ground, to catch 
      The answer to his cry. 
And he hears the rough winds blowing, 
      And the waters rise and fall, 
But never an answer comes to him, 
      Save the echo of his call. 
He sees no hope, no succor, 
      His feeble voice is lost; 
Yet what shall he do but watch and wait, 
      Though he perish at his post! 
 
So, faintly calling and crying 
      Till the sun is under the sea; 
Crying and moaning till the stars 
      Come out for company; 
He thinks of his brother and sister, 
      Asleep in their safe warm bed; 
He thinks of his father and mother, 
      Of himself as dying—and dead; 
And of how, when the night is over, 
      They must come and find him at last: 
But he never thinks he can leave the place 
      Where duty holds him fast. 
 
The good dame in the cottage 
      Is up and astir with the light, 
For the thought of her little Peter 
      Has been with her all night. 
And now she watches the pathway, 
      As yester eve she had done; 
But what does she see so strange and black 
      Against the rising sun? 
Her neighbors are bearing between them 
      Something straight to her door; 
Her child is coming home, but not 
      As he ever came before! 
 
“He is dead!” she cries; “my darling!” 
      And the startled father hears, 
And comes and looks the way she looks, 
      And fears the thing she fears: 
Till a glad shout from the bearers 
      Thrills the stricken man and wife— 
“Give thanks, for your son has saved our land, 
      And God has saved his life!” 
So, there in the morning sunshine 
      They knelt about the boy; 
And every head was bared and bent 
      In tearful, reverent joy. 
 
’T is many a year since then; but still, 
      When the sea roars like a flood, 
Their boys are taught what a boy can do 
      Who is brave and true and good. 
For every man in that country 
      Takes his son by the hand, 
And tells him of little Peter, 
      Whose courage saved the land. 
 
They have many a valiant hero, 
      Remembered through the years: 
But never one whose name so oft 
      Is named with loving tears. 
And his deed shall be sung by the cradle, 
      And told to the child on the knee, 
So long as the dikes of Holland 
      Divide the land from the sea!",ballad,verse forms,"['Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43917/a-leak-in-the-dike,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/phoebe-cary,,1824.0,1871.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

      As his slender, childish hand. 
’T is a leak in the dike! He is but a boy, 
      Unused to fearful scenes; 
But, young as he is, he has learned to know 
      The dreadful thing that means. 
A leak in the dike! The stoutest heart 
      Grows faint that cry to hear, 
And the bravest man in all the land 
      Turns white with mortal fear. 
For he knows the smallest leak may grow 
      To a flood in a single night; 
And he knows the strength of the cruel sea 
      When loosed in its angry might. 
 
And the boy! He has seen the danger, 
      And, shouting a wild alarm, 
He forces back the weight of the sea 
      With the strength of his single arm! 
He listens for the joyful sound 
      Of a footstep passing nigh; 
And lays his ear to the ground, to catch 
      The answer to his cry. 
And he hears the rough winds blowing, 
      And the waters rise and fall, 
But never an answer comes to him, 
      Save the echo of his call. 
He sees no hope, no succor, 
      His feeble voice is lost; 
Yet what shall he do but watch and wait, 
      Though he perish at his post! 
 
So, faintly calling and crying 
      Till the sun is under the sea; 
Crying and moaning till the stars 
      Come out for company; 
He thinks of his brother and sister, 
      Asleep in their safe warm bed; 
He thinks of his father and mother, 
      Of himself as dying—and dead; 
And of how, when the night is over, 
      They must come and find him at last: 
But he never thinks he can leave the place 
      Where duty holds him fast. 
 
The good dame in the cottage 
      Is up and astir with the light, 
For the thought of her little Peter 
      Has been with her all night. 
And now she watches the pathway, 
      As yester eve she had done; 
But what does she see so strange and black 
      Against the rising sun? 
Her neighbors are bearing between them 
      Something straight to her door; 
Her child is coming home, but not 
      As he ever came before! 
 
“He is dead!” she cries; “my darling!” 
      And the startled father hears, 
And comes and looks the way she looks, 
      And fears the thing she fears: 
Till a glad shout from the bearers 
      Thrills the stricken man and wife— 
“Give thanks, for your son has saved our land, 
      And God has saved his life!” 
So, there in the morning sunshine 
      They knelt about the boy; 
And every head was bared and bent 
      In tearful, reverent joy. 
 
’T is many a year since then; but still, 
      When the sea roars like a flood, 
Their boys are taught what a boy can do 
      Who is brave and true and good. 
For every man in that country 
      Takes his son by the hand, 
And tells him of little Peter, 
      Whose courage saved the land. 
 
They have many a valiant hero, 
      Remembered through the years: 
But never one whose name so oft 
      Is named with loving tears. 
And his deed shall be sung by the cradle, 
      And told to the child on the knee, 
So long as the dikes of Holland 
      Divide the land from the sea!",common measure,meters,"['Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Social Commentaries', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Common Measure']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43917/a-leak-in-the-dike,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/phoebe-cary,,1824.0,1871.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Phoebe Cary,1824–1871,Suppose,"Suppose, my little lady,
      Your doll should break her head,
Could you make it whole by crying
      Till your eyes and nose are red?
And would n’t it be pleasanter
      To treat it as a joke;
And say you ’re glad “’T was Dolly’s
      And not your head that broke?”

Suppose you ’re dressed for walking,
      And the rain comes pouring down,
Will it clear off any sooner
      Because you scold and frown?
And would n’t it be nicer
      For you to smile than pout,
And so make sunshine in the house
      When there is none without?

Suppose your task, my little man,
      Is very hard to get,
Will it make it any easier
      For you to sit and fret?
And would n’t it be wiser
      Than waiting like a dunce,
To go to work in earnest
      And learn the thing at once?

Suppose that some boys have a horse,

Will it tire you less while walking
      To say, “It is n’t fair?”
And would n’t it be nobler
      To keep your temper sweet,
And in your heart be thankful
      You can walk upon your feet?

And suppose the world don’t please you,
      Nor the way some people do,
Do you think the whole creation
      Will be altered just for you?

Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Burial of the Rev. George Gilfillan,"On the Gilfillan burial day, 
In the Hill o’ Balgay, 
It was a most solemn sight to see, 
Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, 
All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, 
That death had suddenly taken away, 
And was going to be buried in the Hill o’ Balgay. 
 
There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, 
And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, 
And their bosoms heaved with pain, 
Because they knew they would never look upon his like again. 
 
There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, 
And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, 
And in whispers some of them did say, 
As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, 
Along the Nethergate that day. 
 
I’m sure he will be greatly missed by the poor, 
For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; 
And to assist them in distress it didn’t give him pain, 
And I’m sure the poor will never look upon his like again. 
 
On the Gilfillan burial day, in the Hill o’ Balgay, 
There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, 
And marched in front of the procession all the way; 
Also the relatives and friends of the deceas’d, 
Whom I hope from all sorrows has been releas’d, 
And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, 
To sing with saints above for ever and aye. 
 
The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; 
Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way 
For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, 
Which she will remember until her dying day. 
 
When the procession arrived in the Hill o’ Balgay, 
The people were almost as hush as death, and many of them did say— 
As long as we live we’ll remember the day 
That the great Gilfillan was buried in the Hill o’Balgay. 
 
When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, 
’Twas then the people’s hearts with sorrow did heave; 
And with tearful eyes and bated breath, 
Mrs Gilfillan lamented her loving husband’s death. 
 
Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, 
Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; 
And all the people left with sad hearts that day, 
And that ended the Gilfillan burial in the Hill o’ Balgay.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45826/the-burial-of-the-rev-george-gilfillan,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Tay Bridge Disaster,"Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv’ry Tay!
Alas! I am very sorry to say
That ninety lives have been taken away
On the last Sabbath day of 1879,
Which will be remember’d for a very long time.

’Twas about seven o’clock at night,
And the wind it blew with all its might,
And the rain came pouring down,
And the dark clouds seem’d to frown,
And the Demon of the air seem’d to say—
“I’ll blow down the Bridge of Tay.”

When the train left Edinburgh
The passengers’ hearts were light and felt no sorrow,
But Boreas blew a terrific gale,
Which made their hearts for to quail,
And many of the passengers with fear did say—
“I hope God will send us safe across the Bridge of Tay.”

But when the train came near to Wormit Bay,
Boreas he did loud and angry bray,
And shook the central girders of the Bridge of Tay
On the last Sabbath day of 1879,
Which will be remember’d for a very long time.

So the train sped on with all its might,
And Bonnie Dundee soon hove in sight,
And the passengers’ hearts felt light,
Thinking they would enjoy themselves on the New Year,
With their friends at home they lov’d most dear,
And wish them all a happy New Year.

So the train mov’d slowly along the Bridge of Tay,
Until it was about midway,
Then the central girders with a crash gave way,
And down went the train and passengers into the Tay!
The Storm Fiend did loudly bray,
Because ninety lives had been taken away,
On the last Sabbath day of 1879,
Which will be remember’d for a very long time.

As soon as the catastrophe came to be known
The alarm from mouth to mouth was blown,
And the cry rang out all o’er the town,
Good Heavens! the Tay Bridge is blown down,
And a passenger train from Edinburgh,
Which fill’d all the people’ hearts with sorrow,
And made them for to turn pale,
Because none of the passengers were sav’d to tell the tale
How the disaster happen’d on the last Sabbath day of 1879,
Which will be remember’d for a very long time.

It must have been an awful sight,
To witness in the dusky moonlight,
While the Storm Fiend did laugh, and angry did bray,
Along the Railway Bridge of the Silv’ry Tay,
Oh! ill-fated Bridge of the Silv’ry Tay,
I must now conclude my lay
By telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay,
That your central girders would not have given way,
At least many sensible men do say,
Had they been supported on each side with buttresses,
At least many sensible men confesses,
For the stronger we our houses do build,
The less chance we have of being killed.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Weather', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Architecture & Design', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45828/the-tay-bridge-disaster,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir,"Ye sons of Great Britain, come join with me,
And sing in praise of Sir Garnet Wolseley;
Sound drums and trumpets cheerfully,
For he has acted most heroically.

Therefore loudly his praises sing
Until the hills their echoes back doth ring;
For he is a noble hero bold,
And an honour to his Queen and country, be it told.

He has gained for himself fame and renown,
Which to posterity will be handed down;
Because he has defeated Arabi by land and by sea,
And from the battle of Tel-el-Kebir he made him to flee.

With an army about fourteen thousand strong,
Through Egypt he did fearlessly march along,
With the gallant and brave Highland brigade,
To whom honour is due, be it said.

Arabi’s army was about seventy thousand in all,
And, virtually speaking, it wasn’t very small;
But if they had been as numerous again,
The Irish and Highland brigades would have beaten them, it is plain.

’Twas on the 13th day of September, in the year of 1882,
Which Arabi and his rebel horde long will rue;
Because Sir Garnet Wolseley and his brave little band
Fought and conquered them on Kebir land.

He marched upon the enemy with his gallant band
O’er the wild and lonely desert sand,
And attacked them before daylight,
And in twenty minutes he put them to flight.

The first shock of the attack was borne by the Second Brigade,
Who behaved most manfully, it is said,
Under the command of brave General Grahame,
And have gained a lasting honour to their name.

But Major Hart and the 18th Royal Irish, conjoint,
Carried the trenches at the bayonet point;
Then the Marines chased them about four miles away,
At the charge of the bayonet, without dismay!

General Sir Archibald Alison led on the Highland Brigade,
Who never were the least afraid.
And such has been the case in this Egyptian war,
For at the charge of the bayonet they ran from them afar!

With their bagpipes playing, and one ringing cheer,
And the 42nd soon did the trenches clear;
Then hand to hand they did engage,
And fought like tigers in a cage.

Oh! it must have been a glorious sight
To see Sir Garnet Wolseley in the thickest of the fight!
In the midst of shot and shell, and the cannon’s roar,
Whilst the dead and the dying lay weltering in their gore.

Then the Egyptians were forced to yield,
And the British were left masters of the field;
Then Arabi he did fret and frown
To see his army thus cut down.

Then Arabi the rebel took to flight,
And spurred his Arab steed with all his might:
With his heart full of despair and woe,
And never halted till he reached Cairo.

Now since the Egyptian war is at an end,
Let us thank God! Who did send
Sir Garnet Wolseley to crush and kill
Arabi and his rebel army at Kebir hill.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45830/the-battle-of-tel-el-kebir,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Famous Tay Whale,"’Twas in the month of December, and in the year 1883,
That a monster whale came to Dundee,
Resolved for a few days to sport and play,
And devour the small fishes in the silvery Tay.

So the monster whale did sport and play
Among the innocent little fishes in the beautiful Tay,
Until he was seen by some men one day,
And they resolved to catch him without delay.

When it came to be known a whale was seen in the Tay,
Some men began to talk and to say,
We must try and catch this monster of a whale,
So come on, brave boys, and never say fail.

Then the people together in crowds did run,
Resolved to capture the whale and to have some fun!
So small boats were launched on the silvery Tay,
While the monster of the deep did sport and play.

Oh! it was a most fearful and beautiful sight,
To see it lashing the water with its tail all its might,
And making the water ascend like a shower of hail,
With one lash of its ugly and mighty tail.

Then the water did descend on the men in the boats,
Which wet their trousers and also their coats;
But it only made them the more determined to catch the whale,
But the whale shook at them his tail.

Then the whale began to puff and to blow,
While the men and the boats after him did go,
Armed well with harpoons for the fray,
Which they fired at him without dismay.

And they laughed and grinned just like wild baboons,
While they fired at him their sharp harpoons:
But when struck with the harpoons he dived below,
Which filled his pursuers’ hearts with woe:

Because they guessed they had lost a prize,
Which caused the tears to well up in their eyes;
And in that their anticipations were only right,
Because he sped on to Stonehaven with all his might:

And was first seen by the crew of a Gourdon fishing boat,
Which they thought was a big coble upturned afloat;
But when they drew near they saw it was a whale,
So they resolved to tow it ashore without fail.

So they got a rope from each boat tied round his tail,
And landed their burden at Stonehaven without fail;
And when the people saw it their voices they did raise,
Declaring that the brave fishermen deserved great praise.

And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,
No matter what other people may think or what is their creed;
I know fishermen in general are often very poor,
And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door.

So Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,
And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;
Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,
So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.

Then hurrah! for the mighty monster whale,
Which has got 17 feet 4 inches from tip to tip of a tail!
Which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling,
That is to say, if the people all are willing.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Animals', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45829/the-famous-tay-whale,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Little Match Girl,"It was biting cold, and the falling snow, 
Which filled a poor little match girl’s heart with woe, 
Who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street, 
Crying, “Who’ll buy my matches? for I want pennies to buy some meat!” 
 
When she left home she had slippers on; 
But, alas! poor child, now they were gone. 
For she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, 
Out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet. 
 
So the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; 
And the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, 
For nobody had bought any matches that day, 
Which filled her little mind with grief and dismay. 
 
Alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; 
So in a corner between two houses she made bold 
To take shelter from the violent storm. 
Poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born. 
 
And she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home 
For fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone 
Because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, 
And to go home without pennies she was in dread. 
 
The large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; 
While the passers-by for her had no care, 
As they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, 
While the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face. 
 
As night wore on her hands were numb with cold, 
And no longer her strength could her uphold, 
When an idea into her little head came: 
She’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame. 
 
And she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, 
And it helped to fill her heart with glee; 
And she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; 
But, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand! 
 
Her body was found half-covered with snow, 
And as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; 
And many present let fall a burning tear 
Because she was found dead on the last night of the year, 
 
In that mighty city of London, wherein is plenty of gold— 
But, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold. 
But I hope the match girl’s in Heaven, beside her Saviour dear, 
A bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Nature', 'Winter', 'Philosophy', 'Social Commentaries', 'Class', 'Money & Economics', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45820/the-little-match-girl,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,An Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan,"All hail to the Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, 
He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see. 
He is a man of genius bright, 
And in him his congregation does delight, 
Because they find him to be honest and plain, 
Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain. 
He preaches in a plain straightforward way, 
The people flock to hear him night and day, 
And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away, 
Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day. 
He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, 
And while he lives he will never be forgot, 
Nor when he is dead, 
Because by his admirers it will be often read; 
And fill their minds with wonder and delight, 
And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night. 
He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, 
Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, 
Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, 
And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, 
And in that he is always right, 
For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, 
Do it with all your might.

Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,Descriptive Jottings of London,"As I stood upon London Bridge and viewed the mighty throng 
Of thousands of people in cabs and ’busses rapidly whirling along, 
All furiously driving to and fro, 
Up one street and down another as quick as they could go: 
 
Then I was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there, 
Which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air: 
And the river Thames is a most beautiful sight, 
To see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night. 
 
And the Tower of London is most gloomy to behold, 
And the crown of England lies there, begemmed with precious stones and gold; 
King Henry the Sixth was murdered there by the Duke of Glo’ster, 
And when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor. 
 
St. Paul’s Cathedral is the finest building that ever I did see, 
There’s no building can surpass it in the city of Dundee, 
Because it’s magnificent to behold, 
With its beautiful dome and spire glottering like gold. 
 
And as for Nelson’s Monument that stands in Trafalgar Square, 
It is a most stately monument I most solemnly declare, 
And towering defiantly very high, 
Which arrests strangers’ attention while passing by. 
 
Then there’s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high, 
Where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry; 
And at the foot of the monument there’s three bronze lions in grand array, 
Enough to make the stranger’s heart throb with dismay. 
 
Then there’s Mr Spurgeon, a great preacher, which no one dare gainsay, 
I went to hear him preach on the Sabbath-day, 
And he made my heart feel light and gay, 
When I heard him preach and pray. 
 
And the Tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor, 
And many were standing outside the door; 
He is an eloquent preacher I honestly declare, 
And I was struck with admiration as on him I did stare. 
 
Then there’s Petticoat Lane I venture to say, 
It’s a wonderful place on the Sabbath-day; 
There wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old, 
For the ready cash, silver, coppers, or gold. 
 
Oh! mighty city of London! you are wonderful to see, 
And thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist’s heart with glee; 
But during my short stay, and while wandering there,

Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,Jottings of New York: A Descriptive Poem,"Oh mighty City of New York! you are wonderful to behold, 
Your buildings are magnificent, the truth be it told, 
They were the only thing that seemed to arrest my eye, 
Because many of them are thirteen storeys high. 
 
And as for Central Park, it is lovely to be seen, 
Especially in the summer season when its shrubberies and trees are green; 
And the Burns’ statue is there to be seen, 
Surrounded by trees, on the beautiful sward so green; 
Also Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, 
Which by Englishmen and Scotchmen will ne’er be forgot. 
 
There the people on the Sabbath-day in thousands resort, 
All loud, in conversation and searching for sport, 
Some of them viewing the menagerie of wild beasts there, 
And also beautiful black swans, I do declare. 
 
And there’s beautiful boats to be seen there, 
And the joyous shouts of the children do rend the air, 
While the boats sail along with them o’er Lohengrin Lake, 
And the fare is five cents for children and adults ten is all they take. 
 
And there’s also summer-house shades and merry-go-rounds, 
And with the merry laughter of the children the Park resounds 
During the livelong Sabbath day, 
Enjoying the merry-go-round play. 
 
Then there’s the elevated railroads, about five storeys high, 
Which the inhabitants can see and hear night and day passing by, 
Oh! such a mass of people daily do throng, 
No less than five hundred thousand daily pass along, 
And all along the City you can get for five cents, 
And, believe me, among the passengers there are few discontent. 
 
And the top of the houses are all flat, 
And in the warm weather the people gather to chat, 
Besides on the house-tops they dry their clothes, 
And also many people all night on the house-tops repose. 
 
And numerous ships and steamboats are there to be seen, 
Sailing along the East River Water so green; 
’Tis certainly a most beautiful sight 
To see them sailing o’er the smooth water day and night. 
 
And Brooklyn Bridge is a very great height, 
And fills the stranger’s heart with wonder at first sight, 
But with all its loftiness, I venture to say, 
For beauty it cannot surpass the new Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay. 
 
And there’s also ten thousand rumsellers there, 
Oh! wonderful to think, I do declare! 
To accommodate the people of That city therein, 
And to encourage them to commit all sorts of sin. 
 
And on the Sabbath-day, ye will see many a man 
Going for beer with a tin can, 
And seems proud to be seen carrying home the beer 
To treat his neighbours and family dear. 
 
Then at night numbers of the people dance and sing, 
Making the walls of their houses to ring 
With their songs and dancing on Sabbath night, 
Which I witnessed with disgust, and fled from the sight. 
 
And with regard to New York and the sights I did see, 
One street in Dundee is more worth to me, 
And, believe me, the morning I sailed from New York 
For Bonnie Dundee, my heart it felt as light as a cork.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45823/jottings-of-new-york-a-descriptive-poem,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Which serve for a safe retreat from the wild bruins.

And there’s icy crags and precipices, also beautiful waterfalls,
And as the stranger gazes thereon, his heart it appals
With a mixture of wonder, fear, and delight,
Till at last he exclaims, Oh! what a wonderful sight!

The icy mountains they’re higher than a brig’s topmast,
And the stranger in amazement stands aghast
As he beholds the water flowing off the melted ice
Adown the mountain sides, that he cries out, Oh! how nice!

Such sights as these are truly magnificent to be seen,
Only that the mountain tops are white instead of green,
And rents and caverns in them, the same as on a rugged mountain side,
And suitable places, in my opinion, for mermaids to reside.

Sometimes these icy mountains suddenly topple o’er
With a wild and rumbling hollow-starting roar;
And new peaks and cliffs rise up out of the sea,
While great cataracts of uplifted brine pour down furiously.

And those that can witness such an awful sight
Can only gaze thereon in solemn silence and delight,
And the most Godfearless man that hath this region trod
Would be forced to recognise the power and majesty of God.

Oh! how awful and grand it must be on a sunshiny day
To see one of these icy mountains in pieces give way!
While, crack after crack, it falls with a mighty crash
Flat upon the sea with a fearful splash.

And in the breaking up of these mountains they roar like thunder,
Which causes the stranger no doubt to wonder;
Also the Esquimaux of Greenland betimes will stand
And gaze on the wondrous work of the Almighty so grand.

When these icy mountains are falling, the report is like big guns,
And the glittering brilliancy of them causes mock-suns,
And around them there’s connected a beautiful ring of light,
And as the stranger looks thereon, it fills his heart with delight.

Oh! think on the danger of seafaring men
If any of these mighty mountains where falling on them;
Alas! they would be killed ere the hand of man could them save
And, poor creatures, very likely find a watery grave!

’Tis most beautiful to see and hear the whales whistling and blowing,
And the sailors in their small boats quickly after them rowing,
While the whales keep lashing the water all their might
With their mighty tails, left and right.

In winter there’s no sunlight there night or day,
Which, no doubt, will cause the time to pass tediously away,
And cause the Esquimaux to long for the light of day,
So as they will get basking themselves in the sun’s bright array.

In summer there is perpetual sunlight,
Which fill the Esquimaux’s hearts with delight;
And is seen every day and night in the blue sky,
Which makes the scenery appear most beautiful to the eye.

During summer and winter there the land is covered with snow,
Which sometimes must fill the Esquimaux’ hearts with woe
As they traverse fields of ice, ten or fifteen feet thick,
And with cold, no doubt, their hearts will be touched to the quick.

And let those that read or hear this feel thankful to God
That the icy fields of Greenland they have never trod;
Especially while seated around the fireside on a cold winter night,
Let them think of the cold and hardships Greenland sailors have to fight.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45824/greenlands-icy-mountains,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Battle of Omdurman,"Ye Sons of Great Britain! come join with me
And sing in praise of the gallant British Armie,
That behaved right manfully in the Soudan,
At the great battle of Omdurman.

’Twas in the year of 1898, and on the 2nd of September,
Which the Khalifa and his surviving followers will long remember,
Because Sir Herbert Kitchener has annihilated them outright,
By the British troops and Soudanese in the Omdurman fight.

The Sirdar and his Army left the camp in grand array,
And marched on to Omdurman without delay,
Just as the brigades had reached the crest adjoining the Nile,
And became engaged with the enemy in military style.

The Dervishes had re-formed under cover of a rocky eminence,
Which to them, no doubt, was a strong defence,
And they were massed together in battle array
Around the black standard of the Khalifa, which made a grand display.

But General Maxwell’s Soudanese brigade seized the eminence in a short time,
And General Macdonald’s brigade then joined the firing line;
And in ten minutes, long before the attack could be driven home,
The flower of the Khalifa’s army was almost overthrown.

Still manfully the dusky warriors strove to make headway,
But the Soudanese troops and British swept them back without dismay,
And their main body were mown down by their deadly fire—
But still the heroic Dervishes refused to retire.

And defiantly they planted their standards and died by them,
To their honour be it said, just like brave men;
But at last they retired, with their hearts full of woe,
Leaving the field white with corpses, like a meadow dotted with snow.

The chief heroes in the fight were the 21st Lancers;
They made a brilliant charge on the enemy with ringing cheers,
And through the dusky warriors bodies their lances they did thrust,
Whereby many of them were made to lick the dust.

Then at a quarter past eleven the Sirdar sounded the advance,
And the remnant of the Dervishes fled, which was their only chance,
While the cavalry cut off their retreat while they ran;
Then the Sirdar, with the black standard of the Khalifa, headed for Omdurman.

And when the Khalifa saw his noble army cut down,
With rage and grief he did fret and frown;
Then he spurred his noble steed, and swiftly it ran,
While inwardly to himself he cried, “Catch me if you can!”

And Mahdism now has received a crushing blow,
For the Khalifa and his followers have met with a complete overthrow;
And General Gordon has been avenged, the good Christian,
By the defeat of the Khalifa at the battle of Omdurman.

Now since the Khalifa has been defeated and his rule at an end,
Let us thank God that fortunately did send
The brave Sir Herbert Kitchener to conquer that bad man,
The inhuman Khalifa, and his followers at the battle of Omdurman.

Success to Sir Herbert Kitchener! he is a great commander,
And as skilful in military tactics as the great Alexander,
Because he devised a very wise plan,
And by it has captured the town of Omdurman.

I wish success to the British and Soudanese Army,
May God protect them by land and by sea,
May he enable them always to conquer the foe,
And to establish what’s right wherever they go.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45819/the-battle-of-omdurman,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,An Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan,"All hail to the Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, 
He is the greatest preacher I did ever hear or see. 
He is a man of genius bright, 
And in him his congregation does delight, 
Because they find him to be honest and plain, 
Affable in temper, and seldom known to complain. 
He preaches in a plain straightforward way, 
The people flock to hear him night and day, 
And hundreds from the doors are often turn’d away, 
Because he is the greatest preacher of the present day. 
He has written the life of Sir Walter Scott, 
And while he lives he will never be forgot, 
Nor when he is dead, 
Because by his admirers it will be often read; 
And fill their minds with wonder and delight, 
And wile away the tedious hours on a cold winter’s night. 
He has also written about the Bards of the Bible, 
Which occupied nearly three years in which he was not idle, 
Because when he sits down to write he does it with might and main, 
And to get an interview with him it would be almost vain, 
And in that he is always right, 
For the Bible tells us whatever your hands findeth to do, 
Do it with all your might. 
Rev. George Gilfillan of Dundee, I must conclude my muse, 
And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse, 
Nor does it give me pain to tell the world fearlessly, that when

Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall,1825–1902,The Burial of the Rev. George Gilfillan,"On the Gilfillan burial day, 
In the Hill o’ Balgay, 
It was a most solemn sight to see, 
Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, 
All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, 
That death had suddenly taken away, 
And was going to be buried in the Hill o’ Balgay. 
 
There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, 
And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, 
And their bosoms heaved with pain, 
Because they knew they would never look upon his like again. 
 
There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, 
And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, 
And in whispers some of them did say, 
As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, 
Along the Nethergate that day. 
 
I’m sure he will be greatly missed by the poor, 
For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; 
And to assist them in distress it didn’t give him pain, 
And I’m sure the poor will never look upon his like again. 
 
On the Gilfillan burial day, in the Hill o’ Balgay, 
There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, 
And marched in front of the procession all the way; 
Also the relatives and friends of the deceas’d, 
Whom I hope from all sorrows has been releas’d, 
And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, 
To sing with saints above for ever and aye. 
 
The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; 
Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way 
For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, 
Which she will remember until her dying day. 
 
When the procession arrived in the Hill o’ Balgay, 
The people were almost as hush as death, and many of them did say— 
As long as we live we’ll remember the day 
That the great Gilfillan was buried in the Hill o’Balgay. 
 
When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, 
’Twas then the people’s hearts with sorrow did heave; 
And with tearful eyes and bated breath, 
Mrs Gilfillan lamented her loving husband’s death. 
 
Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, 
Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; 
And all the people left with sad hearts that day, 
And that ended the Gilfillan burial in the Hill o’ Balgay.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45826/the-burial-of-the-rev-george-gilfillan,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-mcgonagall,,1825.0,1902.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Soft moon! I feel thy song, m y fairest friend!

Dumb harmony without. And hard! ’t is nigh!

Of living silver shows me where she shook
Her long white fingers down the shadowy brook,

George Meredith,1828 – 1909,Modern Love: XXIII,"’Tis Christmas weather, and a country house
Receives us: rooms are full: we can but get
An attic-crib. Such lovers will not fret
At that, it is half-said. The great carouse
Knocks hard upon the midnight’s hollow door,
But when I knock at hers, see the pit.
Why did I come here in that dullard fit?
I enter, and lie couched upon the floor.
Passing, I caught the coverlet’s quick beat:—
Come, Shame, burn to my soul! and Pride, and Pain—
Foul demons that have tortured me, enchain!
Out in the freezing darkness the lambs bleat.
The small bird stiffens in the low starlight.
I know not how, but shuddering as I slept,
I dreamed a banished angel to me crept:
My feet were nourished on her breasts all night.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Anxiety', 'Heartache', 'Love', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/modern-love-xxiii-0,https://poets.org/poet/george-meredith,1909,1828.0,1909.0,['Sonnet'],"['Anxiety', 'Heartache', 'Love', 'Public Domain']",[],Academy of American Poets
George Meredith,1828 – 1909,Modern Love: XX," I am not of those miserable males
Who sniff at vice, and, daring not to snap,
Do therefore hope for heaven. I take the hap
Of all my deeds. The wind that fills my sails,
Propels; but I am helmsman. Am I wrecked,
I know the devil has sufficient weight
To bear: I lay it not on him, or fate.
Besides, he’s damned. That man I do suspect
A coward, who would burden the poor deuce
With what ensues from his own slipperiness.
I have just found a wanton-scented tress
In an old desk, dusty for lack of use.
Of days and nights it is demonstrative,
That, like some aged star, gleam luridly.

Have I not any charity to give?",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Future', 'Identity', 'Memories', 'Public Domain', 'Self']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/modern-love-xx,https://poets.org/poet/george-meredith,1909,1828.0,1909.0,['Sonnet'],"['Future', 'Identity', 'Memories', 'Public Domain', 'Self']",[],Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets

Not solely that the Future she destroys,
And the fair life which in the distance lies
For all men, beckoning out from dim rich skies:
Nor that the passing hour’s supporting joys
Have lost the keen-edged flavour, which begat
Distinction in old times, and still should breed
Sweet Memory, and Hope,—earth’s modest seed,
And heaven’s high prompting: not that the world is flat
Since that soft-luring creature I embraced,
Among the children of Illusion went:
Methinks with all this loss I were content,
If the mad Past, on which my foot is based,
Were firm, or might be blotted: but the whole
Of life is mixed: the mocking Past will stay:
And if I drink oblivion of a day,
So shorten I the stature of my soul.

Out in the yellow meadows, where the bee
Hums by us with the honey of the Spring,
And showers of sweet notes from the larks on wing,
Are dropping like a noon-dew, wander we.
Or is it now? or was it then? for now,
As then, the larks from running rings pour showers:
The golden foot of May is on the flowers,
And friendly shadows dance upon her brow.
What’s this, when Nature swears there is no change
To challenge eyesight? Now, as then, the grace
Of heaven seems holding earth in its embrace.
Nor eyes, nor heart, has she to feel it strange?
Look, woman, in the West. There wilt thou see
An amber cradle near the sun’s decline:
Within it, featured even in death divine,
Is lying a dead infant, slain by thee.

He felt the wild beast in him between whiles
So masterfully rude, that he would grieve
To see the helpless delicate thing receive
His guardianship through certain dark defiles.
Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?
But still be spared her. Once: ‘Have you no fear?’
He said: ’t was dusk; she in his grasp; none near.
She laughed: ‘No, surely; am I not with you?’
And uttering that soft starry ‘you,’ she leaned
 Her gentle body near him, looking up;
And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,
He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.
Devilish malignant witch! and oh, young beam
Of heaven’s circle-glory! Here thy shape
To squeeze like an intoxicating grape—
I might, and yet thou goest safe, supreme.

Yet it was plain she struggled, and that salt
Of righteous feeling made her pitiful.
Poor twisting worm, so queenly beautiful!
Where came the cleft between us? whose the fault?
My tears are on thee, that have rarely dropped
As balm for any bitter wound of mine:
My breast will open for thee at a sign!
But no: we are two reed-pipes, coarsely stopped:
The God once filled them with his mellow breath;
And they were music till he flung them down,
Used! used! Hear now the discord-loving clown
Puff his gross spirit in them, worse than death!
I do not know myself without thee more:
In this unholy battle I grow base:
If the same soul be under the same face,
Speak, and a taste of that old time restore!

A message from her set his brain aflame.
A world of household matters filled her mind,
Wherein he saw hypocrisy designed:
She treated him as something that is tame,
And but at other provocation bites.
Familiar was her shoulder in the glass,
Through that dark rain: yet it may come to pass
That a changed eye finds such familiar sights
More keenly tempting than new loveliness.
The ‘What has been’ a moment seemed his own:
The splendours, mysteries, dearer because known,
Nor less divine: Love’s inmost sacredness,
Called to him, ‘Come!’—In his restraining start,
Eyes nurtured to be looked at, scarce could see
A wave of the great waves of Destiny
Convulsed at a checked impulse of the heart.

This was the woman; what now of the man?
But pass him. If he comes beneath a heel,
He shall be crushed until he cannot feel,
Or, being callous, haply till he can.
But he is nothing:—nothing? Only mark
The rich light striking out from her on him!
Ha! what a sense it is when her eyes swim
Across the man she singles, leaving dark
All else! Lord God, who mad’st the thing so fair,
See that I am drawn to her even now!
It cannot be such harm on her cool brow
To put a kiss? Yet if meet him there!
But she is mine! Ah, no! I know too well
I claim a star whose light is overcast:
I claim a phantom-woman in the Past.
The hour has struck, though I heard not the bell!

Her eyes were guilty gates, that let him in
By shutting all too zealous for their sin:
Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask.
But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had!
Her sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:
A languid humour stole among the hours,
And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,
And raged, deep inward, till the light was brown
Before his vision, and the world forgot,
Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.
A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown
The pit of infamy: and then again
He fainted on his vengefulness, and strove
To ape the magnanimity of love,
And smote himself, a shuddering heap of pain.

That, at his hand's light quiver by her head,
The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
Were called into her with a sharp surprise,
And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,
Dreadfully venomous to him. She lay
Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away
With muffled pulses. Then, as midnight makes
Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat
Sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet
Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,
By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.
Like sculptured effigies they might be seen
Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;
Each wishing for the sword that severs all.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain. ,https://poets.org/poem/modern-love-i,https://poets.org/poet/george-meredith,1909,1828.0,1909.0,['Sonnet'],['Public Domain'],[],Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets

Less for the flowers, than what the flowers convey;

And not unto myself ascribe, unduly,
Things which you neither meant nor wished to say,

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,A Rhapsody of a Southern Winter Night,"Oh! dost thou flatter falsely, Hope?
The day hath scarcely passed that saw thy birth, 
Yet thy white wings are plumed to all their scope, 
And hour by hour thine eyes have gathered light,
 And grown so large and bright,
That my whole future life unfolds what seems, 
 Beneath their gentle beams,
A path that leads athwart some guiltless earth, 
To which a star is dropping from the night!

       Not many moons ago,
But when these leafless beds were all aglow 
With summer’s dearest treasures, I
Was reading in this lonely garden-nook; 
A July noon was cloudless in the sky, 
And soon I put my shallow studies by; 
Then sick at heart, and angered by the book, 
Which, in good sooth, was but the long-drawn sigh 
Of some one who had quarreled with his kind, 
Vexed at the very proofs which I had sought, 
And all annoyed while all alert to find 
A plausible likeness of my own dark thought, 
I cast me down beneath yon oak’s wide boughs, 
And, shielding with both hands my throbbing brows, 
Watched lazily the shadows of my brain. 
The feeble tide of peevishness went down, 
And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain 
Which seemed to clog the blood in every vein; 
The world, of course, put on its darkest frown—
In all its realms I saw no mortal crown 
Which did not wound or crush some restless head; 
And hope, and will, and motive, all were dead. 
So, passive as a stone, I felt too low
To claim a kindred with the humblest flower; 
Even that would bare its bosom to a shower, 
While I henceforth would take no pains to live, 
Nor place myself where I might feel or give 
A single impulse whence a wish could grow. 
There was a tulip scarce a gossamer’s throw 
Beyond that platanus. A little child,
Most dear to me, looked through the fence and smiled 
A hint that I should pluck it for her sake. 
Ah, me! I trust I was not well awake—
       The voice was very sweet,
Yet a faint languor kept me in my seat.
I saw a pouted lip, a toss, and heard
Some low expostulating tones, but stirred
Not even a leaf’s length, till the pretty fay, 
Wondering, and half abashed at the wild feat, 
Climbed the low pales, and laughed my gloom away.

And here again, but led by other powers, 
A morning and a golden afternoon,
These happy stars, and yonder setting moon, 
Have seen me speed, unreckoned and untasked, 
       A round of precious hours.
Oh! here, where in that summer noon I basked, 
And strove, with logic frailer than the flowers, 
To justify a life of sensuous rest,
A question dear as home or heaven was asked, 
And without language answered. I was blest!
Blest with those nameless boons too sweet to trust 
Unto the telltale confidence of song.
Love to his own glad self is sometimes coy,
And even thus much doth seem to do him wrong; 
While in the fears which chasten mortal joy, 
Is one that shuts the lips, lest speech too free, 
With the cold touch of hard reality,
Should turn its priceless jewels into dust.
Since that long kiss which closed the morning’s talk, 
I have not strayed beyond this garden walk. 
As yet a vague delight is all I know,
A sense of joy so wild ’t is almost pain,
And like a trouble drives me to and fro,
And will not pause to count its own sweet gain. 
I am so happy! that is all my thought! 
To-morrow I will turn it round and round, 
And seek to know its limits and its ground. 
To-morrow I will task my heart to learn 
The duties which shall spring from such a seed, 
And where it must be sown, and how be wrought. 
But oh! this reckless bliss is bliss indeed! 
And for one day I choose to seal the urn 
Wherein is shrined Love’s missal and his creed. 
Meantime I give my fancy all it craves;
Like him who found the West when first he caught 
The light that glittered from the world he sought,
And furled his sails till Dawn should show the land; 
While in glad dreams he saw the ambient waves 
Go rippling brightly up a golden strand.

Hath there not been a softer breath at play 
In the long woodland aisles than often sweeps
At this rough season through their solemn deeps—
A gentle Ariel sent by gentle May,
               Who knew it was the morn
               On which a hope was born, 
To greet the flower ere it was fully blown, 
And nurse it as some lily of her own? 
And wherefore, save to grace a happy day, 
Did the whole West at blushing sunset glow 
With clouds that, floating up in bridal snow, 
Passed with the festal eve, rose-crowned, away! 
And now, if I may trust my straining sight, 
The heavens appear with added stars to-night, 
And deeper depths, and more celestial height,
Than hath been reached except in dreams or death. 
Hush, sweetest South! I love thy delicate breath; 
But hush! methought I felt an angel’s kiss! 
Oh! all that lives is happy in my bliss. 
That lonely fir, which always seems
As though it locked dark secrets in itself, 
               Hideth a gentle elf,
Whose wand shall send me soon a frolic troop 
Of rainbow visions, and of moonlit dreams. 
Can joy be weary, that my eyelids droop? 
To-night I shall not seek my curtained nest,
               But even here find rest.
Who whispered then? And what are they that peep 
Betwixt the foliage in the tree-top there? 
Come, Fairy Shadows! for the morn is near, 
When to your sombre pine ye all must creep; 
Come, ye wild pilots of the darkness, ere 
My spirit sinks into the gulf of Sleep; 
Even now it circles round and round the deep—

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,Two Portraits,"I
You say, as one who shapes a life, 
That you will never be a wife,

And, laughing lightly, ask my aid 
To paint your future as a maid.

This is the portrait; and I take 
The softest colors for your sake:

The springtime of your soul is dead, 
And forty years have bent your head;

The lines are firmer round your mouth, 
But still its smile is like the South.

Your eyes, grown deeper, are not sad, 
Yet never more than gravely glad;

And the old charm still lurks within 
The cloven dimple of your chin.

Some share, perhaps, of youthful gloss 
Your cheek hath shed; but still across

The delicate ear are folded down
Those silken locks of chestnut brown;

Though here and there a thread of gray 
Steals through them like a lunar ray.

One might suppose your life had passed 
Unvexed by any troubling blast.

And such—for all that I foreknow—
May be the truth! The deeper woe!

A loveless heart is seldom stirred; 
And sorrow shuns the mateless bird;

But ah! through cares alone we reach 
The happiness which mocketh speech;

In the white courts beyond the stars 
The noblest brow is seamed with scars;

And they on earth who’ve wept the most 
Sit highest of the heavenly host.

Grant that your maiden life hath sped 
In music o’er a golden bed,

With rocks, and winds, and storms at truce, 
And not without a noble use;

Yet are you happy? In your air 
I see a nameless want appear,

And a faint shadow on your cheek 
Tells what the lips refuse to speak.

You have had all a maid could hope 
In the most cloudless horoscope:

The strength that cometh from above; 
A Christian mother’s holy love;

And always at thy soul’s demand 
A brother’s, sister’s heart and hand.

Small need your heart hath had to roam 
Beyond the circle of your home;

And yet upon your wish attends 
A loving throng of genial friends.

What, in a lot so sweet as this,
Is wanting to complete your bliss?

And to what secret shall I trace
The clouds that sometimes cross your face,

And that sad look which now and then 
Comes, disappears, and comes again,

And dies reluctantly away
In those clear eyes of azure gray?

At best, and after all, the place 
You fill with such a serious grace,

Hath much to try a woman’s heart, 
And you but play a painful part.

The world around, with little ruth,
Still laughs at maids who have not youth,

And, right or wrong, the old maid rests 
The victim of its paltry jests,

And still is doomed to meet and bear 
Its pitying smile or furtive sneer.

These are indeed but petty things,
And yet they touch some hearts like stings.

But I acquit you of the shame 
Of being unresisting game;

For you are of such tempered clay 
As turns far stronger shafts away,

And all that foes or fools could guide 
Would only curl that lip of pride.

How then, O weary one! explain 
The sources of that hidden pain?

Alas! you have divined at length
How little you have used your strength,

Which, with who knows what human good, 
Lies buried in that maidenhood,

Where, as amid a field of flowers,
You have but played with April showers.

Ah! we would wish the world less fair, 
If spring alone adorned the year,

And autumn came not with its fruit, 
And autumn hymns were ever mute.

So I remark with small surprise 
That, as the unvarying season flies,

From day to night and night to day, 
You sicken of your endless May.

In this poor life we may not cross 
One virtuous instinct without loss,

And the soul grows not to its height 
Till love calls forth its utmost might.

Not blind to all you might have been, 
And with some consciousness of sin—

Because with love you sometimes played, 
And choice, not fate, hath kept you maid—

You feel that you must pass from earth 
But half-acquainted with its worth,

And that within your heart are deeps 
In which a nobler woman sleeps;

That not the maiden, but the wife 
Grasps the whole lesson of a life,

While such as you but sit and dream 
Along the surface of its stream.

And doubtless sometimes, all unsought, 
There comes upon your hour of thought,

Despite the struggles of your will, 
A sense of something absent still;

And then you cannot help but yearn 
To love and be beloved in turn,

As they are loved, and love, who live 
As love were all that life could give;

And in a transient clasp or kiss 
Crowd an eternity of bliss;

They who of every mortal joy
Taste always twice, nor feel them cloy,

Or, if woes come, in Sorrow’s hour 
Are strengthened by a double power.

    *

Here ends my feeble sketch of what 
Might, but will never be your lot;

And I foresee how oft these rhymes 
Shall make you smile in after-times.

If I have read your nature right, 
It only waits a spark of light;

And when that comes, as come it must, 
It will not fall on arid dust,

Nor yet on that which breaks to flame 
In the first blush of maiden shame;

But on a heart which, even at rest, 
Is warmer than an April nest,

Where, settling soft, that spark shall creep 
About as gently as a sleep;

Still stealing on with pace so slow 
Yourself will scarcely feel the glow,

Till after many and many a day, 
Although no gleam its course betray,

It shall attain the inmost shrine, 
And wrap it in a fire divine!

I know not when or whence indeed 
Shall fall and burst the burning seed,

But oh! once kindled, it will blaze, 
I know, forever! By its rays

You will perceive, with subtler eyes, 
The meaning in the earth and skies,

Which, with their animated chain
Of grass and flowers, and sun and rain,

Of green below, and blue above, 
Are but a type of married love.

You will perceive that in the breast 
The germs of many virtues rest,

Which, ere they feel a lover’s breath, 
Lie in a temporary death;

And till the heart is wooed and won 
It is an earth without a sun.

II
But now, stand forth as sweet as life! 
And let me paint you as a wife.

I note some changes in your face, 
And in your mien a graver grace;

Yet the calm forehead lightly bears 
Its weight of twice a score of years;

And that one love which on this earth 
Can wake the heart to all its worth,

And to their height can lift and bind 
The powers of soul, and sense, and mind,

Hath not allowed a charm to fade—
And the wife’s lovelier than the maid.

An air of still, though bright repose 
Tells that a tender hand bestows

All that a generous manhood may 
To make your life one bridal day,

While the kind eyes betray no less, 
In their blue depths of tenderness,

That you have learned the truths which lie 
Behind that holy mystery,

Which, with its blisses and its woes, 
Nor man nor maiden ever knows.

If now, as to the eyes of one
Whose glance not even thought can shun,

Your soul lay open to my view, 
I, looking all its nature through,

Could see no incompleted part,
For the whole woman warms your heart.

I cannot tell how many dead 
You number in the cycles fled,

And you but look the more serene 
For all the griefs you may have seen,

As you had gathered from the dust
The flowers of Peace, and Hope, and Trust.

Your smile is even sweeter now 
Than when it lit your maiden brow,

And that which wakes this gentler charm 
Coos at this moment on your arm.

Your voice was always soft in youth, 
And had the very sound of truth,

But never were its tones so mild
Until you blessed your earliest child;

And when to soothe some little wrong 
It melts into a mother’s song,

The same strange sweetness which in years 
Long vanished filled the eyes with tears,

And (even when mirthful) gave always 
A pathos to your girlish lays,

Falls, with perchance a deeper thrill, 
Upon the breathless listener still.

I cannot guess in what fair spot
The chance of Time hath fixed your lot,

Nor can I name what manly breast 
Gives to that head a welcome rest;

I cannot tell if partial Fate
Hath made you poor, or rich, or great;

But oh! whatever be your place, 
I never saw a form or face

To which more plainly hath been lent 
The blessing of a full content!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Couplet']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,Katie,"It may be through some foreign grace, 
And unfamiliar charm of face; 
It may be that across the foam
Which bore her from her childhood’s home, 
By some strange spell, my Katie brought, 
Along with English creeds and thought—
Entangled in her golden hair—
Some English sunshine, warmth, and air! 
I cannot tell—but here to-day, 
A thousand billowy leagues away 
From that green isle whose twilight skies
No darker are than Katie’s eyes,
She seems to me, go where she will, 
An English girl in England still;

I meet her on the dusty street, 
And daisies spring about her feet;
Or, touched to life beneath her tread, 
An English cowslip lifts its head;
And, as to do her grace, rise up 
The primrose and the buttercup!
I roam with her through fields of cane, 
And seem to stroll an English lane, 
Which, white with blossoms of the May, 
Spreads its green carpet in her way! 
As fancy wills, the path beneath 
Is golden gorse, or purple heath: 
And now we hear in woodlands dim 
Their unarticulated hymn,
Now walk through rippling waves of wheat, 
Now sink in mats of clover sweet, 
Or see before us from the lawn 
The lark go up to greet the dawn! 
All birds that love the English sky 
Throng round my path when she is by: 
The blackbird from a neighboring thorn 
With music brims the cup of morn, 
And in a thick, melodious rain 
The mavis pours her mellow strain! 
But only when my Katie’s voice 
Makes all the listening woods rejoice 
I hear—with cheeks that flush and pale—
The passion of the nightingale!

Anon the pictures round her change, 
And through an ancient town we range, 
Whereto the shadowy memory clings 
Of one of England’s Saxon kings, 
And which to shrine his fading fame 
Still keeps his ashes and his name. 
Quaint houses rise on either hand, 
But still the airs are fresh and bland, 
As if their gentle wings caressed 
Some new-born village of the West. 
A moment by the Norman tower 
We pause; it is the Sabbath hour! 
And o’er the city sinks and swells 
The chime of old St. Mary’s bells, 
Which still resound in Katie’s ears
As sweet as when in distant years 
She heard them peal with jocund din 
A merry English Christmas in! 
We pass the abbey’s ruined arch, 
And statelier grows my Katie’s march, 
As round her, wearied with the taint 
Of Transatlantic pine and paint, 
She sees a thousand tokens cast 
Of England’s venerable Past! 
Our reverent footsteps lastly claims 
The younger chapel of St. James, 
Which though, as English records run, 
Not old, had seen full many a sun, 
Ere to the cold December gale 
The sullen Pilgrim spread his sail. 
There Katie in her childish days
Spelt out her prayers and lisped her praise, 
And doubtless, as her beauty grew, 
Did much as other maidens do—
Across the pews and down the aisle 
Sent many a beau-bewildering smile, 
And to subserve her spirit’s need 
Learned other things beside the creed! 
There, too, to-day her knee she bows, 
And by her one whose darker brows 
Betray the Southern heart that burns 
Beside her, and which only turns 
Its thoughts to Heaven in one request, 
Not all unworthy to be blest, 
But rising from an earthlier pain 
Than might beseem a Christian fane. 
Ah! can the guileless maiden share 
The wish that lifts that passionate prayer? 
Is all at peace that breast within? 
Good angels! warn her of the sin! 
Alas! what boots it? who can save 
A willing victim of the wave? 
Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt? 
Or gather wine when wine is spilt?

We quit the holy house and gain 
The open air; then, happy twain, 
Adown familiar streets we go,
And now and then she turns to show, 
With fears that all is changing fast, 
Some spot that’s sacred to her Past.
Here by this way, through shadows cool,
A little maid, she tripped to school; 
And there each morning used to stop 
Before a wonder of a shop
Where, built of apples and of pears, 
Rose pyramids of golden spheres; 
While, dangling in her dazzled sight, 
Ripe cherries cast a crimson light, 
And made her think of elfin lamps, 
And feast and sport in fairy camps, 
Whereat, upon her royal throne 
(Most richly carved in cherry-stone), 
Titania ruled, in queenly state, 
The boisterous revels of the fête!
’T was yonder, with their “horrid” noise, 
Dismissed from books, she met the boys, 
Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls, 
Glanced slightly at her sunny curls, 
And laughed and leaped as reckless by 
As though no pretty face were nigh! 
But—here the maiden grows demure—
Indeed she’s not so very sure, 
That in a year, or haply twain, 
Few looked who failed to look again, 
And sooth to say, I little doubt 
(Some azure day, the truth will out!) 
That certain baits in certain eyes 
Caught many an unsuspecting prize; 
And somewhere underneath these eaves 
A budding flirt put forth its leaves!

Has not the sky a deeper blue, 
Have not the trees a greener hue,
And bend they not with lordlier grace
And nobler shapes above the place 
Where on one cloudless winter morn 
My Katie to this life was born? 
Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour 
When love to sight gave keener power, 
And lovers looked for special boons 
In brighter flowers and larger moons. 
But wave the foliage as it may, 
And let the sky be ashen gray, 
Thus much at least a manly youth
May hold—and yet not blush—as truth: 
If near that blessed spot of earth 
Which saw the cherished maiden’s birth 
No softer dews than usual rise, 
And life there keeps its wonted guise, 
Yet not the less that spot may seem 
As lovely as a poet’s dream;
And should a fervid faith incline 
To make thereof a sainted shrine, 
Who may deny that round us throng 
A hundred earthly creeds as wrong, 
But meaner far, which yet unblamed 
Stalk by us and are not ashamed. 
So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll 
Ends at this portal, while you roll 
Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray 
That may recall some vanished day,
I—let them jeer and laugh who will—
Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!

So strongly sometimes on the sense 
These fancies hold their influence,
That in long well-known streets I stray 
Like one who fears to lose his way. 
The stranger, I, the native, she,
Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea; 
And changing place, and mixing times, 
I walk in unfamiliar climes!
These houses, free to every breeze 
That blows from warm Floridian seas,
Assume a massive English air,
And close around an English square; 
While, if I issue from the town, 
An English hill looks greenly down, 
Or round me rolls an English park, 
And in the Broad I hear the Larke! 
Thus when, where woodland violets hide, 
I rove with Katie at my side,
It scarce would seem amiss to say, 
“Katie! my home lies far away, 
Beyond the pathless waste of brine, 
In a young land of palm and pine! 
There, by the tropic heats, the soul 
Is touched as if with living coal, 
And glows with such a fire as none 
Can feel beneath a Northern sun, 
Unless—my Katie’s heart attest!—
’T is kindled in an English breast! 
Such is the land in which I live, 
And, Katie! such the soul I give. 
Come! ere another morning beam, 
We’ll cleave the sea with wings of steam; 
And soon, despite of storm or calm, 
Beneath my native groves of palm,
Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride, 
The Southron and his English bride!”",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Love', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Couplet']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,The Unknown Dead,"The rain is plashing on my sill, 
But all the winds of Heaven are still; 
And so it falls with that dull sound 
Which thrills us in the church-yard ground, 
When the first spadeful drops like lead 
Upon the coffin of the dead. 
Beyond my streaming window-pane, 
I cannot see the neighboring vane, 
Yet from its old familiar tower 
The bell comes, muffled, through the shower. 
What strange and unsuspected link 
Of feeling touched, has made me think— 
While with a vacant soul and eye 
I watch that gray and stony sky— 
Of nameless graves on battle-plains 
Washed by a single winter’s rains, 
Where, some beneath Virginian hills, 
And some by green Atlantic rills, 
Some by the waters of the West, 
A myriad unknown heroes rest. 
Ah! not the chiefs who, dying, see 
Their flags in front of victory, 
Or, at their life-blood’s noble cost 
Pay for a battle nobly lost, 
Claim from their monumental beds 
The bitterest tears a nation sheds. 
Beneath yon lonely mound—the spot 
By all save some fond few forgot— 
Lie the true martyrs of the fight, 
Which strikes for freedom and for right. 
Of them, their patriot zeal and pride, 
The lofty faith that with them died, 
No grateful page shall farther tell 
Than that so many bravely fell; 
And we can only dimly guess 
What worlds of all this world’s distress, 
What utter woe, despair, and dearth, 
Their fate has brought to many a hearth. 
Just such a sky as this should weep 
Above them, always, where they sleep; 
Yet, haply, at this very hour, 
Their graves are like a lover’s bower; 
And Nature’s self, with eyes unwet, 
Oblivious of the crimson debt 
To which she owes her April grace, 
Laughs gaily o’er their burial place.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Related Audio', 'Living', 'Death', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,Our Willie,"’T was merry Christmas when he came, 
Our little boy beneath the sod; 
And brighter burned the Christmas flame, 
And merrier sped the Christmas game, 
Because within the house there lay   
A shape as tiny as a fay— 
      The Christmas gift of God! 
In wreaths and garlands on the walls   
The holly hung its ruby balls, 
      The mistletoe its pearls; 
And a Christmas tree’s fantastic fruits   
Woke laughter like a choir of flutes 
      From happy boys and girls. 
For the mirth, which else had swelled as shrill   
As a school let loose to its errant will, 
      Was softened by the thought,   
That in a dim hushed room above   
A mother’s pains in a mother’s love 
      Were only just forgot. 
The jest, the tale, the toast, the glee, 
All took a sober tone; 
We spoke of the babe upstairs, as we   
Held festival for him alone. 
When the bells rang in the Christmas morn,   
It scarcely seemed a sin to say 
That they rang because that babe was born,   
Not less than for the sacred day. 
Ah! Christ forgive us for the crime 
Which drowned the memories of the time   
      In a merely mortal bliss! 
We owned the error when the mirth 
Of another Christmas lit the hearth 
      Of every home but this. 
When, in that lonely burial-ground, 
With every Christmas sight and sound   
Removed or shunned, we kept 
A mournful Christmas by the mound   
Where little Willie slept! 
 
Ah, hapless mother! darling wife!   
I might say nothing more, 
And the dull cold world would hold   
The story of that precious life 
      As amply told! 
Shall we, shall you and I, before   
That world’s unsympathetic eyes   
Lay other relics from our store 
      Of tender memories? 
What could it know of the joy and love   
That throbbed and smiled and wept above 
      An unresponsive thing? 
And who could share the ecstatic thrill   
With which we watched the upturned bill   
Of our bird at its living spring?   
Shall we tell how in the time gone by,   
Beneath all changes of the sky,   
And in an ordinary home 
      Amid the city’s din, 
Life was to us a crystal dome,   
      Our babe the flame therein?   
Ah! this were jargon on the mart; 
And though some gentle friend, 
And many and many a suffering heart,   
Would weep and comprehend,   
Yet even these might fail to see   
What we saw daily in the child— 
Not the mere creature undefiled,   
But the winged cherub soon to be. 
That wandering hand which seemed to reach 
      At angel finger-tips, 
And that murmur like a mystic speech   
      Upon the rosy lips, 
That something in the serious face   
Holier than even its infant grace,   
And that rapt gaze on empty space,   
Which made us, half believing, say,   
“Ah, little wide-eyed seer! who knows   
But that for you this chamber glows   
With stately shapes and solemn shows?”   
Which touched us, too, with vague alarms,   
Lest in the circle of our arms   
We held a being less akin 
To his parents in a world of sin   
Than to beings not of clay: 
How could we speak in human phrase,   
Of such scarce earthly traits and ways,   
      What would not seem 
      A doting dream, 
In the creed of these sordid days?   
      No! let us keep 
      Deep, deep, 
In sorrowing heart and aching brain,   
This story hidden with the pain,   
Which since that blue October night   
When Willie vanished from our sight,   
Must haunt us even in our sleep. 
In the gloom of the chamber where he died,   
And by that grave which, through our care,   
From Yule to Yule of every year,   
Is made like spring to bloom; 
And where, at times, we catch the sigh 
As of an angel floating nigh, 
Who longs but has not power to tell 
That in that violet-shrouded cell 
Lies nothing better than the shell 
Which he had cast aside— 
By that sweet grave, in that dark room,   
We may weave at will for each other’s ear, 
Of that life, and that love, and that early doom,   
The tale which is shadowed here: 
To us alone it will always be 
As fresh as our own misery; 
But enough, alas! for the world is said, 
In the brief “Here lieth” of the dead!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Parenthood', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Couplet']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,Charleston,"Calm as that second summer which precedes
        The first fall of the snow,
 In the broad sunlight of heroic deeds,
        The City bides the foe.
  
 As yet, behind their ramparts stern and proud,
        Her bolted thunders sleep—
 Dark Sumter, like a battlemented cloud,
        Looms o’er the solemn deep.
  
 No Calpe frowns from lofty cliff or scar
        To guard the holy strand;
 But Moultrie holds in leash her dogs of war
        Above the level sand.
  
 And down the dunes a thousand guns lie couched,
        Unseen, beside the flood—
 Like tigers in some Orient jungle crouched
         That wait and watch for blood.
  
 Meanwhile, through streets still echoing with trade,
        Walk grave and thoughtful men,
 Whose hands may one day wield the patriot’s blade
        As lightly as the pen.
  
 And maidens, with such eyes as would grow dim
        Over a bleeding hound,
 Seem each one to have caught the strength of him
        Whose sword she sadly bound.
  
 Thus girt without and garrisoned at home,
        Day patient following day,
 Old Charleston looks from roof, and spire, and dome,
        Across her tranquil bay.
  
 Ships, through a hundred foes, from Saxon lands
        And spicy Indian ports,
 Bring Saxon steel and iron to her hands,
        And summer to her courts.
  
 But still, along you dim Atlantic line,
        The only hostile smoke
 Creeps like a harmless mist above the brine,
        From some frail, floating oak.
  
 Shall the spring dawn, and she still clad in smiles,
        And with an unscathed brow,
 Rest in the strong arms of her palm-crowned isles,
        As fair and free as now?
  
 We know not; in the temple of the Fates
        God has inscribed her doom;
 And, all untroubled in her faith, she waits
        The triumph or the tomb.",quatrain,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Quatrain']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,The Summer Bower,"It is a place whither I’ve often gone
For peace, and found it, secret, hushed, and cool, 
A beautiful recess in neighboring woods. 
Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall, 
Arch it o’erhead and column it around, 
Framing a covert, natural and wild,
Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed 
But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot 
Unwearied and unweakened. Sound is here 
A transient and unfrequent visitor;
Yet if the day be calm, not often then, 
Whilst the high pines in one another’s arms 
Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear 
Catch the far fall of voices, how remote 
You know not, and you do not care to know. 
The turf is soft and green, but not a flower 
Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and bright—
I do not know its name—which here and there 
Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.
A narrow opening in the branched roof,
A single one, is large enough to show,
With that half-glimpse a dreamer loves so much, 
The blue air and the blessing of the sky.
Thither I always bent my idle steps,
When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart, 
And found the calm I looked for, or returned 
Strong with the quite rapture in my soul.
                                         But one day,
One of those July days when winds have fled 
One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind 
With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt, 
Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark 
With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had 
No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,
I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day, 
Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once 
No medicinal virtue.
                    Not a leaf
Stirred with the whispering welcome which I sought, 
But in a close and humid atmosphere,
Every fair plant and implicated bough
Hung lax and lifeless. Something in the place, 
Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,
And some more secret influence, I thought, 
Weighed on the sense like sin. Above I saw, 
Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,
The palid sky look through a glazed mist
Like a blue eye in death.
                         The change, perhaps, 
Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,
The weather, and the time explain it all:
Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,
And shrined it in these verses for my heart. 
Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought 
Not less, and in all shades of various moods; 
But always shun to desecrate the spot
By weak repinings, sickly sentiments,
Or inconclusive sorrows. Nature, though
Pure as she was in Eden when her breath
Kissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,
In her own way and with a just reserve, 
To sympathize with human suffering; 
But for the pains, the fever, and the fret 
Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,
She hath no solace; and who seeks her when 
These be the troubles over which he moans, 
Reads in her unreplying lineaments 
Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness, 
Strike like contempt.",pastoral,types/modes,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Summer', 'Pastoral', 'Blank Verse']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,The Unknown Dead,"The rain is plashing on my sill, 
But all the winds of Heaven are still; 
And so it falls with that dull sound 
Which thrills us in the church-yard ground, 
When the first spadeful drops like lead 
Upon the coffin of the dead. 
Beyond my streaming window-pane, 
I cannot see the neighboring vane, 
Yet from its old familiar tower 
The bell comes, muffled, through the shower. 
What strange and unsuspected link 
Of feeling touched, has made me think— 
While with a vacant soul and eye 
I watch that gray and stony sky— 
Of nameless graves on battle-plains 
Washed by a single winter’s rains, 
Where, some beneath Virginian hills, 
And some by green Atlantic rills, 
Some by the waters of the West, 
A myriad unknown heroes rest. 
Ah! not the chiefs who, dying, see 
Their flags in front of victory, 
Or, at their life-blood’s noble cost 
Pay for a battle nobly lost, 
Claim from their monumental beds 
The bitterest tears a nation sheds. 
Beneath yon lonely mound—the spot 
By all save some fond few forgot— 
Lie the true martyrs of the fight, 
Which strikes for freedom and for right. 
Of them, their patriot zeal and pride, 
The lofty faith that with them died, 
No grateful page shall farther tell 
Than that so many bravely fell; 
And we can only dimly guess 
What worlds of all this world’s distress, 
What utter woe, despair, and dearth, 
Their fate has brought to many a hearth. 
Just such a sky as this should weep 
Above them, always, where they sleep; 
Yet, haply, at this very hour, 
Their graves are like a lover’s bower; 
And Nature’s self, with eyes unwet, 
Oblivious of the crimson debt 
To which she owes her April grace, 
Laughs gaily o’er their burial place.",elegy,types/modes,"['Related Audio', 'Living', 'Death', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Elegy', 'Couplet']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,Ode,"Sung on the occasion of decorating the graves of the Confederate dead, at Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, S. C., 1866

Sleep sweetly in your humble graves,
 Sleep, martyrs of a fallen cause!—
Though yet no marble column craves
 The pilgrim here to pause.

In seeds of laurels in the earth,
 The garlands of your fame are sown;
And, somewhere, waiting for its birth, 
 The shaft is in the stone.

Meanwhile, your sisters for the years
 Which hold in trust your storied tombs, 
Bring all they now can give you—tears,
 And these memorial blooms.

Small tributes, but your shades will smile
 As proudly on these wreaths to-day, 
As when some cannon-moulded pile
 Shall overlook this Bay.

Stoop, angels, hither from the skies! 
 There is no holier spot of ground, 
Than where defeated valor lies
 By mourning beauty crowned.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,The Summer Bower,"It is a place whither I’ve often gone
For peace, and found it, secret, hushed, and cool, 
A beautiful recess in neighboring woods. 
Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall, 
Arch it o’erhead and column it around, 
Framing a covert, natural and wild,
Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed 
But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot 
Unwearied and unweakened. Sound is here 
A transient and unfrequent visitor;
Yet if the day be calm, not often then, 
Whilst the high pines in one another’s arms 
Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear 
Catch the far fall of voices, how remote 
You know not, and you do not care to know. 
The turf is soft and green, but not a flower 
Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and bright—
I do not know its name—which here and there 
Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.
A narrow opening in the branched roof,
A single one, is large enough to show,
With that half-glimpse a dreamer loves so much, 
The blue air and the blessing of the sky.
Thither I always bent my idle steps,
When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart, 
And found the calm I looked for, or returned 
Strong with the quite rapture in my soul.
                                         But one day,
One of those July days when winds have fled 
One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind 
With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt, 
Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark 
With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had 
No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,
I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day, 
Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once 
No medicinal virtue.
                    Not a leaf
Stirred with the whispering welcome which I sought, 
But in a close and humid atmosphere,
Every fair plant and implicated bough
Hung lax and lifeless. Something in the place, 
Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,
And some more secret influence, I thought, 
Weighed on the sense like sin. Above I saw, 
Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,
The palid sky look through a glazed mist
Like a blue eye in death.
                         The change, perhaps,

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,Retirement,"My gentle friend! I hold no creed so false
As that which dares to teach that we are born 
For battle only, and that in this life
The soul, if it would burn with starlike power, 
Must needs forsooth be kindled by the sparks 
Struck from the shock of clashing human hearts. 
There is a wisdom that grows up in strife, 
And one—I like it best—that sits at home 
And learns its lessons of a thoughtful ease.
So come! a lonely house awaits thee!—there 
Nor praise, nor blame shall reach us, save what love 
Of knowledge for itself shall wake at times 
In our own bosoms; come! and we will build 
A wall of quiet thought, and gentle books, 
Betwixt us and the hard and bitter world. 
Sometimes—for we need not be anchorites—
A distant friend shall cheer us through the Post, 
Or some Gazette—of course no partisan—
Shall bring us pleasant news of pleasant things; 
Then, twisted into graceful allumettes, 
Each ancient joke shall blaze with genuine flame 
To light our pipes and candles; but to wars, 
Whether of words or weapons, we shall be 
Deaf—so we twain shall pass away the time 
Ev’n as a pair of happy lovers, who,
Alone, within some quiet garden-nook,
With a clear night of stars above their heads, 
Just hear, betwixt their kisses and their talk, 
The tumult of a tempest rolling through
A chain of neighboring mountains; they awhile 
Pause to admire a flash that only shows 
The smile upon their faces, but, full soon, 
Turn with a quick, glad impulse, and perhaps 
A conscious wile that brings them closer yet, 
To dally with their own fond hearts, and play 
With the sweet flowers that blossom at their feet.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Growing Old', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Blank Verse']","Source:

Henry Timrod,1828–1867,A Vision of Poesy,"PART I 
 
       I 
In a far country, and a distant age, 
   Ere sprites and fays had bade farewell to earth,  
A boy was born of humble parentage; 
   The stars that shone upon his lonely birth  
Did seem to promise sovereignty and fame— 
Yet no tradition hath preserved his name. 
 
       II 
’T is said that on the night when he was born, 
   A beauteous shape swept slowly through the room;  
Its eyes broke on the infant like a morn, 
   And his cheek brightened like a rose in bloom;  
But as it passed away there followed after  
A sigh of pain, and sounds of elvish laughter. 
 
       III 
And so his parents deemed him to be blest 
   Beyond the lot of mortals; they were poor  
As the most timid bird that stored its nest 
   With the stray gleanings at their cottage-door:  
Yet they contrived to rear their little dove,  
And he repaid them with the tenderest love. 
 
       IV 
The child was very beautiful in sooth, 
   And as he waxed in years grew lovelier still;  
On his fair brow the aureole of truth 
   Beamed, and the purest maidens, with a thrill,  
Looked in his eyes, and from their heaven of blue  
Saw thoughts like sinless Angels peering through. 
 
       V 
Need there was none of censure or of praise 
   To mould him to the kind parental hand;  
Yet there was ever something in his ways, 
   Which those about him could not understand;  
A self-withdrawn and independent bliss, 
Beside the father’s love, the mother’s kiss. 
 
       VI 
For oft, when he believed himself alone, 
   They caught brief snatches of mysterious rhymes, 
Which he would murmur in an undertone, 
   Like a pleased bee’s in summer; and at times  
A strange far look would come into his eyes,  
As if he saw a vision in the skies. 
 
       VII 
And he upon a simple leaf would pore  
   As if its very texture unto him 
Had some deep meaning; sometimes by the door, 
   From noon until a summer-day grew dim, 
He lay and watched the clouds; and to his thought  
Night with her stars but fitful slumbers brought. 
 
       VIII 
In the long hours of twilight, when the breeze 
   Talked in low tones along the woodland rills,  
Or the loud North its stormy minstrelsies 
   Blent with wild noises from the distant hills,  
The boy—his rosy hand against his ear  
Curved like a sea-shell—hushed as some rapt seer, 
 
       IX 
Followed the sounds, and ever and again, 
   As the wind came, and went, in storm or play,  
He seemed to hearken as to some far strain 
   Of mingled voices calling him away; 
And they who watched him held their breath to trace  
The still and fixed attention in his face. 
 
       X 
Once, on a cold and loud-voiced winter night, 
   The three were seated by their cottage-fire— 
The mother watching by its flickering light 
   The wakeful urchin, and the dozing sire;  
There was a brief, quick motion like a bird’s,  
And the boy’s thought thus rippled into words: 
 
       XI 
“O mother! thou hast taught me many things, 
   But none I think more beautiful than speech— 
A nobler power than even those broad wings 
   I used to pray for, when I longed to reach 
That distant peak which on our vale looks down,  
And wears the star of evening for a crown.  
 
       XII 
“But, mother, while our human words are rife 
   To us with meaning, other sounds there be  
Which seem, and are, the language of a life 
   Around, yet unlike ours: winds talk; the sea  
Murmurs articulately, and the sky 
Listens, and answers, though inaudibly.  
 
       XIII 
“By stream and spring, in glades and woodlands lone, 
   Beside our very cot, I’ve gathered flowers  
Inscribed with signs and characters unknown; 
   But the frail scrolls still baffle all my powers:  
What is this language and where is the key  
That opes its weird and wondrous mystery? 
 
       XIV 
“The forests know it, and the mountains know,  
   And it is written in the sunset’s dyes;  
A revelation to the world below 
   Is daily going on before our eyes; 
And, but for sinful thoughts, I do not doubt  
That we could spell the thrilling secret out.  
 
       XV 
“O mother! somewhere on this lovely earth 
   I lived, and understood that mystic tongue,  
But, for some reason, to my second birth 
   Only the dullest memories have clung,  
Like that fair tree that even while blossoming  
Keeps the dead berries of a former spring. 
 
       XVI 
“Who shall put life in these?—my nightly dreams 
   Some teacher of supernal powers foretell; 
A fair and stately shape appears, which seems 
   Bright with all truth; and once, in a dark dell  
Within the forest, unto me there came 
A voice that must be hers, which called my name.” 
 
       XVII 
Puzzled and frightened, wondering more and more,  
   The mother heard, but did not comprehend; 
“So early dallying with forbidden lore! 
   Oh, what will chance, and wherein will it end?  
My child! my child!” she caught him to her breast,  
“Oh, let me kiss these wildering thoughts to rest! 
 
       XVIII 
“They cannot come from God, who freely gives 
   All that we need to have, or ought to know;  
Beware, my son! some evil influence strives 
   To grieve thy parents, and to work thee woe;  
Alas! the vision I misunderstood! 
It could not be an angel fair and good.”  
 
       XIX 
And then, in low and tremulous tones, she told 
   The story of his birth-night; the boy’s eyes,  
As the wild tale went on, were bright and bold, 
   With a weird look that did not seem surprise:  
“Perhaps,” he said, “this lady and her elves  
Will one day come, and take me to themselves.” 
 
       XX 
“And would’st thou leave us?” “Dearest mother, no! 
   Hush! I will check these thoughts that give thee pain;  
Or, if they flow, as they perchance must flow, 
   At least I will not utter them again; 
Hark! didst thou hear a voice like many streams?  
Mother! it is the spirit of my dreams!” 
 
       XXI 
Thenceforth, whatever impulse stirred below, 
   In the deep heart beneath that childish breast,  
Those lips were sealed, and though the eye would glow, 
   Yet the brow wore an air of perfect rest;  
Cheerful, content, with calm though strong control,  
He shut the temple-portals of his soul. 
 
       XXII 
And when too restlessly the mighty throng 
   Of fancies woke within his teeming mind,  
All silently they formed in glorious song, 
   And floated off unheard, and undivined,  
Perchance not lost—with many a voiceless prayer  
They reached the sky, and found some record there. 
 
       XXIII 
Softly and swiftly sped the quiet days; 
   The thoughtful boy has blossomed into youth,  
And still no maiden would have feared his gaze, 
   And still his brow was noble with the truth:  
Yet though he masks the pain with pious art  
There burns a restless fever in his heart. 
 
       XXIV 
A childish dream is now a deathless need 
   Which drives him to far hills and distant wilds;  
The solemn faith and fervor of his creed 
   Bold as a martyr’s, simple as a child’s;  
The eagle knew him as she knew the blast,  
And the deer did not flee him as he passed. 
 
       XXV 
But gentle even in his wildest mood, 
   Always, and most, he loved the bluest weather,  
And in some soft and sunny solitude 
   Couched like a milder sunshine on the heather,  
He communed with the winds, and with the birds,  
As if they might have answered him in words. 
 
       XXVI 
Deep buried in the forest was a nook, 
   Remote and quiet as its quiet skies; 
He knew it, sought it, loved it as a book 
   Full of his own sweet thoughts and memories;  
Dark oaks and fluted chestnuts gathering round,  
Pillared and greenly domed a sloping mound, 
 
       XXVII 
Whereof—white, purple, azure, golden, red, 
   Confused like hues of sunset—the wild flowers  
Wove a rich dais; through crosslights overhead 
   Glanced the clear sunshine, fell the fruitful showers, 
And here the shyest bird would fold her wings;  
Here fled the fairest and the gentlest things.  
 
       XXVIII 
Thither, one night of mist and moonlight, came  
   The youth, with nothing deeper in his thoughts  
Than to behold beneath the silver flame 
   New aspects of his fair and favorite spot;  
A single ray attained the ground, and shed 
Just light enough to guide the wanderer’s tread. 
 
       XXIX 
And high and hushed arose the stately trees, 
   Yet shut within themselves, like dungeons, where  
Lay fettered all the secrets of the breeze; 
   Silent, but not as slumbering, all things there  
Wore to the youth’s aroused imagination  
An air of deep and solemn expectation. 
 
       XXX 
“Hath Heaven,” the youth exclaimed, “a sweeter spot, 
   Or Earth another like it?—yet even here 
The old mystery dwells! and though I read it not, 
   Here most I hope—it is, or seems so near;  
So many hints come to me, but, alas! 
I cannot grasp the shadows as they pass. 
 
       XXXI 
“Here, from the very turf beneath me, I 
   Catch, but just catch, I know not what faint sound,  
And darkly guess that from yon silent sky 
   Float starry emanations to the ground;  
These ears are deaf, these human eyes are blind,  
I want a purer heart, a subtler mind. 
 
       XXXII 
“Sometimes—could it be fancy?—I have felt  
   The presence of a spirit who might speak;  
As down in lowly reverence I knelt, 
   Its very breath has kissed my burning cheek;  
But I in vain have hushed my own to hear 
A wing or whisper stir the silent air!” 
 
       XXXIII 
Is not the breeze articulate? Hark! Oh, hark! 
   A distant murmur, like a voice of floods; 
And onward sweeping slowly through the dark, 
   Bursts like a call the night-wind from the woods!  
Low bow the flowers, the trees fling loose their dreams,  
And through the waving roof a fresher moonlight streams. 
 
       XXXIV 
“Mortal!”—the word crept slowly round the place 
   As if that wind had breathed it! From no star  
Streams that soft lustre on the dreamer’s face. 
   Again a hushing calm! while faint and far 
The breeze goes calling onward through the night.  
Dear God! what vision chains that wide-strained sight? 
 
       XXXV 
Over the grass and flowers, and up the slope 
   Glides a white cloud of mist, self-moved and slow,  
That, pausing at the hillock’s moonlit cope, 
   Swayed like a flame of silver; from below 
The breathless youth with beating heart beholds  
A mystic motion in its argent folds. 
 
       XXXVI 
Yet his young soul is bold, and hope grows warm, 
   As flashing through that cloud of shadowy crape,  
With sweep of robes, and then a gleaming arm, 
   Slowly developing, at last took shape 
A face and form unutterably bright, 
That cast a golden glamour on the night.  
 
       XXXVII 
But for the glory round it it would seem 
   Almost a mortal maiden; and the boy,  
Unto whom love was yet an innocent dream, 
   Shivered and crimsoned with an unknown joy; 
As to the young Spring bounds the passionate South,  
He could have clasped and kissed her mouth to mouth. 
 
       XXXVIII 
Yet something checked, that was and was not dread, 
   Till in a low sweet voice the maiden spake;  
She was the Fairy of his dreams, she said, 
   And loved him simply for his human sake;  
And that in heaven, wherefrom she took her birth,  
They called her Poesy, the angel of the earth. 
 
       XXXIX 
“And ever since that immemorial hour, 
   When the glad morning-stars together sung,  
My task hath been, beneath a mightier Power,  
   To keep the world forever fresh and young; 
I give it not its fruitage and its green, 
But clothe it with a glory all unseen. 
 
       XL 
“I sow the germ which buds in human art, 
   And, with my sister, Science, I explore  
With light the dark recesses of the heart, 
   And nerve the will, and teach the wish to soar;  
I touch with grace the body’s meanest clay,  
While noble souls are nobler for my sway. 
 
       XLI 
“Before my power the kings of earth have bowed; 
   I am the voice of Freedom, and the sword  
Leaps from its scabbard when I call aloud; 
   Wherever life in sacrifice is poured, 
Wherever martyrs die or patriots bleed, 
I weave the chaplet and award the meed. 
 
       XLII 
“Where Passion stoops, or strays, is cold, or dead,  
   I lift from error, or to action thrill! 
Or if it rage too madly in its bed, 
   The tempest hushes at my ‘peace! be still!’ 
I know how far its tides should sink or swell,  
And they obey my sceptre and my spell. 
 
       XLIII 
“All lovely things, and gentle—the sweet laugh  
   Of children, Girlhood’s kiss, and Friendship’s clasp, 
The boy that sporteth with the old man’s staff,

All that exalts the grounds of happiness, 
All griefs that hallow, and all joys that bless,  
 
       XLIV 
“To me are sacred; at my holy shrine 
   Love breathes its latest dreams, its earliest hints;  
I turn life’s tasteless waters into wine, 
   And flush them through and through with purple tints. 
Wherever Earth is fair, and Heaven looks down,  
I rear my altars, and I wear my crown. 
 
       XLV 
“I am the unseen spirit thou hast sought, 
   I woke those shadowy questionings that vex  
Thy young mind, lost in its own cloud of thought, 
   And rouse the soul they trouble and perplex;  
I filled thy days with visions, and thy nights  
Blessed with all sweetest sounds and fairy sights. 
 
       XLVI 
“Not here, not in this world, may I disclose 
   The mysteries in which this life is hearsed;  
Some doubts there be that, with some earthly woes, 
   By Death alone shall wholly be dispersed;  
Yet on those very doubts from this low sod  
Thy soul shall pass beyond the stars to God. 
 
       XLVII 
“And so to knowledge, climbing grade by grade, 
   Thou shalt attain whatever mortals can,  
And what thou may’st discover by my aid 
   Thou shalt translate unto thy brother man;  
And men shall bless the power that flings a ray  
Into their night from thy diviner day. 
 
       XLVIII 
“For from thy lofty height, thy words shall fall 
   Upon their spirits, like bright cataracts  
That front a sunrise; thou shalt hear them call 
   Amid their endless waste of arid facts,  
As wearily they plod their way along,  
Upon the rhythmic zephyrs of thy song. 
 
       XLIX 
“All this is in thy reach, but much depends  
   Upon thyself—thy future I await; 
I give the genius, point the proper ends,  
   But the true bard is his own only Fate;  
Into thy soul my soul have I infused; 
Take care thy lofty powers be wisely used.  
 
       L 
“The Poet owes a high and holy debt, 
   Which, if he feel, he craves not to be heard  
For the poor boon of praise, or place, nor yet  
   Does the mere joy of song, as with the bird 
Of many voices, prompt the choral lay 
That cheers that gentle pilgrim on his way. 
 
       LI 
“Nor may he always sweep the passionate lyre,  
   Which is his heart, only for such relief  
As an impatient spirit may desire, 
   Lest, from the grave which hides a private grief,  
The spells of song call up some pallid wraith  
To blast or ban a mortal hope or faith. 
 
       LII 
“Yet over his deep soul, with all its crowd 
   Of varying hopes and fears, he still must brood;  
As from its azure height a tranquil cloud 
   Watches its own bright changes in the flood;  
Self-reading, not self-loving—they are twain— 
And sounding, while he mourns, the depths of pain. 
 
       LIII 
“Thus shall his songs attain the common breast, 
   Dyed in his own life’s blood, the sign and seal,  
Even as the thorns which are the martyr’s crest, 
   That do attest his office, and appeal 
Unto the universal human heart 
In sanction of his mission and his art. 
 
       LIV 
“Much yet remains unsaid—pure must he be; 
   Oh, blessed are the pure! for they shall hear 
Where others hear not, see where others see 
   With a dazed vision: who have drawn most near  
My shrine, have ever brought a spirit cased  
And mailed in a body clean and chaste. 
 
       LV 
“The Poet to the whole wide world belongs, 
   Even as the teacher is the child’s—I said  
No selfish aim should ever mar his songs, 
   But self wears many guises; men may wed  
Self in another, and the soul may be  
Self to its centre, all unconsciously. 
 
       LVI 
“And therefore must the Poet watch, lest he,  
   In the dark struggle of this life, should take 
Stains which he might not notice; he must flee 
   Falsehood, however winsome, and forsake  
All for the Truth, assured that Truth alone  
Is Beauty, and can make him all my own. 
 
       LVII 
“And he must be as armed warrior strong,  
   And he must be as gentle as a girl, 
And he must front, and sometimes suffer wrong, 
   With brow unbent, and lip untaught to curl;  
For wrath, and scorn, and pride, however just,  
Fill the clear spirit’s eyes with earthly dust.”

The story came to me—it recks not whence— 
In fragments. Oh! if I could tell it all, 
If human speech indeed could tell it all,  
’T were not a whit less wondrous, than if I  
Should find, untouched in leaf and stem, and bright  
As when it bloomed three thousand years ago  
On some Idalian slope, a perfect rose.  
Alas! a leaf or two, and they perchance  
Scarce worth the hiving, one or two dead leaves  
Are the sole harvest of a summer’s toil.  
There was a moment, ne’er to be recalled,  
When to the Poet’s hope within my heart,  
They wore a tint like life’s, but in my hand,  
I know not why, they withered. I have heard  
Somewhere, of some dead monarch, from the tomb  
Where he had slept a century and more,  
Brought forth, that when the coffin was laid bare,  
Albeit the body in its mouldering robes  
Was fleshless, yet one feature still remained  
Perfect, or perfect seemed at least; the eyes  
Gleamed for a second on the startled crowd,  
And then went out in ashes. Even thus  
The story, when I drew it from the grave  
Where it had lain so long, did seem, I thought,  
Not wholly lifeless; but even while I gazed  
To fix its features on my heart, and called  
The world to wonder with me, lo! it proved  
I looked upon a corpse! 
                                    What further fell 
In that lone forest nook, how much was taught,  
How much was only hinted, what the youth  
Promised, if promise were required, to do  
Or strive for, what the gifts he bore away— 
Or added powers or blessings—how at last,  
The vision ended and he sought his home, 
How lived there, and how long, and when he passed  
Into the busy world to seek his fate,  
I know not, and if any ever knew,  
The tale hath perished from the earth; for here  
The slender thread on which my song is strung  
Breaks off, and many after-years of life  
Are lost to sight, the life to reappear  
Only toward its close—as of a dream  
We catch the end, and opening, but forget  
That which had joined them in the dreaming brain; 
Or as a mountain with a belt of mist  
That shows his base, and far above, a peak  
With a blue plume of pines. 
                                          But turn the page  
And read the only hints that yet remain. 
 
 
       PART II 
 
       I 
It is not winter yet, but that sweet time 
   In autumn when the first cool days are past;  
A week ago, the leaves were hoar with rime, 
   And some have dropped before the North wind’s blast; 
But the mild hours are back, and at mid-noon,  
The day hath all the genial warmth of June.  
 
       II 
What slender form lies stretched along the mound? 
   Can it be his, the Wanderer’s, with that brow  
Gray in its prime, those eyes that wander round 
   Listlessly, with a jaded glance that now  
Seems to see nothing where it rests, and then  
Pores on each trivial object in its ken? 
 
       III 
See how a gentle maid’s wan fingers clasp 
   The last fond love-notes of some faithless hand;  
Thus with a transient interest, his weak grasp 
   Holds a few leaves as when of old he scanned  
The meaning in their gold and crimson streaks,  
But the sweet dream has vanished! hush! he speaks! 
 
       IV 
“Once more, once more, after long pain and toil, 
   And yet not long, if I should count by years,  
I breathe my native air, and tread the soil 
   I trod in childhood; if I shed no tears, 
No happy tears, ’t is that their fount is dry,  
And joy that cannot weep must sigh, must sigh. 
 
       V 
“These leaves, my boyish books in days of yore, 
   When, as the weeks sped by, I seemed to stand  
Ever upon the brink of some wild lore, 
   These leaves shall make my bed, and—for the hand  
Of God is on me, chilling brain and breath— 
I shall not ask a softer couch in death. 
 
       VI 
“Here was it that I saw, or dreamed I saw, 
   I know not which, that shape of love and light.  
Spirit of Song! have I not owned thy law? 
   Have I not taught, or striven to teach the right,  
And kept my heart as clean, my life as sweet,  
As mortals may, when mortals mortals meet? 
 
       VII 
“Thou know’st how I went forth, my youthful breast 
   On fire with thee, amid the paths of men;  
Once in my wanderings, my lone footsteps pressed 
   A mountain forest; in a sombre glen, 
Down which its thunderous boom a cataract flung,  
A little bird, unheeded, built and sung. 
 
       VIII 
“So fell my voice amid the whirl and rush  
   Of human passions; if unto my art 
Sorrow hath sometimes owed a gentler gush,  
   I know it not; if any Poet-heart 
Hath kindled at my songs its light divine,  
I know it not; no ray came back to mine.  
 
       IX 
“Alone in crowds, once more I sought to make 
   Of senseless things my friends; the clouds that burn 
Above the sunset, and the flowers that shake 
   Their odors in the wind—these would not turn  
Their faces from me; far from cities, I  
Forgot the scornful world that passed me by. 
 
       X 
“Yet even the world’s cold slights I might have borne, 
   Nor fled, though sorrowing; but I shrank at last 
When one sweet face, too sweet, I thought, for scorn, 
   Looked scornfully upon me; then I passed 
From all that youth had dreamed or manhood planned,  
Into the self that none would understand. 
 
       XI 
“She was—I never wronged her womanhood 
   By crowning it with praises not her own— 
She was all earth’s, and earth’s, too, in that mood 
   When she brings forth her fairest; I atone  
Now, in this fading brow and failing frame,  
That such a soul such soul as mine could tame. 
 
       XII 
“Clay to its kindred clay! I loved in sooth 
   Too deeply and too purely to be blest;  
With something more of lust and less of truth 
   She would have sunk all blushes on my breast,  
And—but I must not blame her—in my ear  
Death whispers! and the end, thank God! draws near!” 
 
       XIII 
Hist! on the perfect silence of the place 
   Comes and dies off a sound like far-off rain  
With voices mingled; on the Poet’s face 
   A shadow, where no shadow should have lain,  
Falls the next moment: nothing meets his sight,  
Yet something moves betwixt him and the light. 
 
       XIV 
And a voice murmurs, “Wonder not, but hear! 
   Me to behold again thou need’st not seek;  
Yet by the dim-felt influence on the air, 
   And by the mystic shadow on thy cheek, 
Know, though thou may’st not touch with fleshly hands,  
The genius of thy life beside thee stands! 
 
       XV 
“Unto no fault, O weary-hearted one! 
   Unto no fault of man’s thou ow’st thy fate;  
All human hearts that beat this earth upon, 
   All human thoughts and human passions wait  
Upon the genuine bard, to him belong,  
And help in their own way the Poet’s song. 
 
       XVI 
“How blame the world? for the world hast thou wrought? 
   Or wast thou but as one who aims to fling  
The weight of some unutterable thought 
   Down like a burden? what from questioning  
Too subtly thy own spirit, and to speech  
But half subduing themes beyond the reach 
 
       XVII 
“Of mortal reason; what from living much 
   In that dark world of shadows, where the soul  
Wanders bewildered, striving still to clutch, 
   Yet never clutching once, a shadowy goal,  
Which always flies, and while it flies seems near,  
Thy songs were riddles hard to mortal ear. 
 
       XVIII 
“This was the hidden selfishness that marred 
   Thy teachings ever; this the false key-note  
That on such souls as might have loved thee jarred 
   Like an unearthly language; thou did’st float  
On a strange water; those who stood on land  
Gazed, but they could not leave their beaten strand. 
 
       XIX 
“Your elements were different, and apart— 
   The world’s and thine—and even in those intense  
And watchful broodings o’er thy inmost heart, 
   It was thy own peculiar difference 
That thou did’st seek; nor did’st thou care to find  
Aught that would bring thee nearer to thy kind.  
 
       XX 
“Not thus the Poet, who in blood and brain 
   Would represent his race and speak for all,  
Weaves the bright woof of that impassioned strain 
   Which drapes, as if for some high festival  
Of pure delights—whence few of human birth  
May rightly be shut out—the common earth. 
 
       XXI 
“As the same law that moulds a planet, rounds 
   A drop of dew, so the great Poet spheres  
Worlds in himself; no selfish limit bounds 
   A sympathy that folds all characters,  
All ranks, all passions, and all life almost  
In its wide circle. Like some noble host, 
 
       XXII 
“He spreads the riches of his soul, and bids 
   Partake who will. Age has its saws of truth,  
And love is for the maiden’s drooping lids, 
   And words of passion for the earnest youth;  
Wisdom for all; and when it seeks relief,  
Tears, and their solace for the heart of grief. 
 
       XXIII 
“Nor less on him than thee, the mysteries 
   Within him and about him ever weigh— 
The meanings in the stars, and in the breeze, 
   All the weird wonders of the common day,  
Truths that the merest point removes from reach,  
And thoughts that pause upon the brink of speech; 
 
       XXIV 
“But on the surface of his song, these lie 
   As shadows, not as darkness; and alway, 
Even though it breathe the secrets of the sky, 
   There is a human purpose in the lay;  
As some tall fir that whispers to the stars  
Shields at its base a cotter’s lattice-bars. 
 
       XXV 
“Even such my Poet! for thou still art mine! 
   Thou might’st have been, and now have calmly died,  
A priest, and not a victim at the shrine;  
   Alas! yet was it all thy fault? I chide, 
Perchance, myself within thee, and the fate  
To which thy power was solely consecrate.  
 
       XXVI 
“Thy life hath not been wholly without use, 
   Albeit that use is partly hidden now;  
In thy unmingled scorn of any truce 
   With this world’s specious falsehoods, often thou  
Hast uttered, through some all unworldly song,  
Truths that for man might else have slumbered long. 
 
       XXVII 
“And these not always vainly on the crowd 
   Have fallen; some are cherished now, and some,  
In mystic phrases wrapped as in a shroud, 
   Wait the diviner, who as yet is dumb 
Upon the breast of God—the gate of birth  
Closed on a dreamless ignorance of earth. 
 
       XXVIII 
“And therefore, though thy name shall pass away, 
   Even as a cloud that hath wept all its showers,  
Yet as that cloud shall live again one day 
   In the glad grass, and in the happy flowers, 
So in thy thoughts, though clothed in sweeter rhymes,  
Thy life shall bear its flowers in future times.”",blank verse,meters,"['Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Fairy-tales & Legends', 'Blank Verse', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

Profound simplicity of intellect,

Strong in grave peace; in pity circumspect.

From lethargy to fever of the heart;
From faithful life to dream-dower'd days apart;
From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;—

Till now. Alas, the soul!—how soon must she
Accept her primal immortality,—
The flesh resume its dust whence it began?

That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat
As lovers to whom Time is whispering.
From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:
The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.
Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay
With us, and of it was our talk. ""Ah, yes!
Love dies!"" I said: I never thought it less.
She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.

Of loneliness was round me. Then I rose,
And my disordered brain did guide my foot
To that old wood where our first love-salute
Was interchanged: the source of many throes!

Toward her, and made proffer of my arm.
She took it simply, with no rude alarm;

George Meredith,1828–1909,Juggling Jerry,"Pitch here the tent, while the old horse grazes:
    By the old hedge-side we'll halt a stage.
It's nigh my last above the daisies:
    My next leaf'll be man's blank page.
Yes, my old girl! and it's no use crying:
    Juggler, constable, king, must bow.
One that outjuggles all's been spying
    Long to have me, and he has me now.

We've travelled times to this old common:
    Often we've hung our pots in the gorse.
We've had a stirring life, old woman!
    You, and I, and the old grey horse.
Races, and fairs, and royal occasions,
    Found us coming to their call:
Now they'll miss us at our stations:
    There's a Juggler outjuggles all!

Up goes the lark, as if all were jolly!
    Over the duck-pond the willow shakes.
Easy to think that grieving's folly,
    When the hand's firm as driven stakes!
Ay, when we're strong, and braced, and manful,
    Life's a sweet fiddle: but we're a batch
Born to become the Great Juggler's han'ful:
    Balls he shies up, and is safe to catch.

Here's where the lads of the village cricket:
    I was a lad not wide from here:
Couldn't I whip off the bale from the wicket?
    Like an old world those days appear!
Donkey, sheep, geese, and thatch'd ale-house—I know them!
    They are old friends of my halts, and seem,
Somehow, as if kind thanks I owe them:
    Juggling don't hinder the heart's esteem.

Juggling's no sin, for we must have victual:
    Nature allows us to bait for the fool.
Holding one's own makes us juggle no little;
    But, to increase it, hard juggling's the rule.
You that are sneering at my profession,
    Haven't you juggled a vast amount?
There's the Prime Minister, in one Session,
    Juggles more games than my sins'll count.

I've murdered insects with mock thunder:
    Conscience, for that, in men don't quail.
I've made bread from the bump of wonder:
    That's my business, and there's my tale.
Fashion and rank all praised the professor:
    Ay! and I've had my smile from the Queen:
Bravo, Jerry! she meant: God bless her!
    Ain't this a sermon on that scene?

I've studied men from my topsy-turvy
    Close, and, I reckon, rather true.
Some are fine fellows: some, right scurvy:
    Most, a dash between the two.
But it's a woman, old girl, that makes me
    Think more kindly of the race:
And it's a woman, old girl, that shakes me
    When the Great Juggler I must face.

We two were married, due and legal:
    Honest we've lived since we've been one.
Lord! I could then jump like an eagle:
    You danced bright as a bit o' the sun.
Birds in a May-bush we were! right merry!
    All night we kiss'd, we juggled all day.
Joy was the heart of Juggling Jerry!
    Now from his old girl he's juggled away.

It's past parsons to console us:
    No, nor no doctor fetch for me:
I can die without my bolus;
    Two of a trade, lass, never agree!
Parson and Doctor!—don't they love rarely
    Fighting the devil in other men's fields!
Stand up yourself and match him fairly:
    Then see how the rascal yields!

I, lass, have lived no gipsy, flaunting
    Finery while his poor helpmate grubs:
Coin I've stored, and you won't be wanting:
    You shan't beg from the troughs and tubs.
Nobly you've stuck to me, though in his kitchen
    Many a Marquis would hail you Cook!
Palaces you could have ruled and grown rich in,
    But your old Jerry you never forsook.

Hand up the chirper! ripe ale winks in it;
    Let's have comfort and be at peace.
Once a stout draught made me light as a linnet.
    Cheer up! the Lord must have his lease.
May be—for none see in that black hollow—
    It's just a place where we're held in pawn,
And, when the Great Juggler makes as to swallow,
    It's just the sword-trick—I ain't quite gone!

Yonder came smells of the gorse, so nutty,
    Gold-like and warm: it's the prime of May.
Better than mortar, brick and putty
    Is God's house on a blowing day.
Lean me more up the mound; now I feel it:
    All the old heath-smells! Ain't it strange?
There's the world laughing, as if to conceal it,
    But He's by us, juggling the change.

I mind it well, by the sea-beach lying,
    Once—it's long gone—when two gulls we beheld,
Which, as the moon got up, were flying
    Down a big wave that sparked and swell'd.
Crack, went a gun: one fell: the second
    Wheeled round him twice, and was off for new luck:
There in the dark her white wing beckon'd:—
    Drop me a kiss—I'm the bird dead-struck!",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Time & Brevity', 'Activities', 'Sports & Outdoor Activities', 'Religion', 'God & the Divine', 'Dramatic Monologue', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44699/juggling-jerry,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/george-meredith,,1828.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Let the round world roll on; let the sun beam;

Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;
   And one there sang who soft and smooth as snow
   Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show;
And one was blue with famine after love,
   Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
The burden of what those were singing of.
One shamed herself in love; one temperately
   Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;
One famished died for love. Thus two of three

Christina Rossetti,1830–1894,Goblin Market,"Morning and evening
Maids heard the goblins cry:
“Come buy our orchard fruits,
Come buy, come buy:
Apples and quinces,
Lemons and oranges,
Plump unpeck’d cherries,
Melons and raspberries,
Bloom-down-cheek’d peaches,
Swart-headed mulberries,
Wild free-born cranberries,
Crab-apples, dewberries,
Pine-apples, blackberries,
Apricots, strawberries;—
All ripe together
In summer weather,—
Morns that pass by,
Fair eves that fly;
Come buy, come buy:
Our grapes fresh from the vine,
Pomegranates full and fine,
Dates and sharp bullaces,
Rare pears and greengages,
Damsons and bilberries,
Taste them and try:
Currants and gooseberries,
Bright-fire-like barberries,
Figs to fill your mouth,
Citrons from the South,
Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;
Come buy, come buy.”

         Evening by evening
Among the brookside rushes,
Laura bow’d her head to hear,
Lizzie veil’d her blushes:
Crouching close together
In the cooling weather,
With clasping arms and cautioning lips,
With tingling cheeks and finger tips.
“Lie close,” Laura said,
Pricking up her golden head:
“We must not look at goblin men,
We must not buy their fruits:
Who knows upon what soil they fed
Their hungry thirsty roots?”
“Come buy,” call the goblins
Hobbling down the glen.

“Oh,” cried Lizzie, “Laura, Laura,
You should not peep at goblin men.”
Lizzie cover’d up her eyes,
Cover’d close lest they should look;
Laura rear’d her glossy head,
And whisper’d like the restless brook:
“Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,
Down the glen tramp little men.
One hauls a basket,
One bears a plate,
One lugs a golden dish
Of many pounds weight.
How fair the vine must grow
Whose grapes are so luscious;
How warm the wind must blow
Through those fruit bushes.”
“No,” said Lizzie, “No, no, no;
Their offers should not charm us,
Their evil gifts would harm us.”
She thrust a dimpled finger
In each ear, shut eyes and ran:
Curious Laura chose to linger
Wondering at each merchant man.
One had a cat’s face,
One whisk’d a tail,
One tramp’d at a rat’s pace,
One crawl’d like a snail,
One like a wombat prowl’d obtuse and furry,
One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.
She heard a voice like voice of doves
Cooing all together:
They sounded kind and full of loves
In the pleasant weather.

         Laura stretch’d her gleaming neck
Like a rush-imbedded swan,
Like a lily from the beck,
Like a moonlit poplar branch,
Like a vessel at the launch
When its last restraint is gone.

         Backwards up the mossy glen
Turn’d and troop’d the goblin men,
With their shrill repeated cry,
“Come buy, come buy.”
When they reach’d where Laura was
They stood stock still upon the moss,
Leering at each other,
Brother with queer brother;
Signalling each other,
Brother with sly brother.
One set his basket down,
One rear’d his plate;
One began to weave a crown
Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown
(Men sell not such in any town);
One heav’d the golden weight
Of dish and fruit to offer her:
“Come buy, come buy,” was still their cry.
Laura stared but did not stir,
Long’d but had no money:
The whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste
In tones as smooth as honey,
The cat-faced purr’d,
The rat-faced spoke a word
Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;
One parrot-voiced and jolly
Cried “Pretty Goblin” still for “Pretty Polly;”—
One whistled like a bird.

         But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
“Good folk, I have no coin;
To take were to purloin:
I have no copper in my purse,
I have no silver either,
And all my gold is on the furze
That shakes in windy weather
Above the rusty heather.”
“You have much gold upon your head,”
They answer’d all together:
“Buy from us with a golden curl.”
She clipp’d a precious golden lock,
She dropp’d a tear more rare than pearl,
Then suck’d their fruit globes fair or red:
Sweeter than honey from the rock,
Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,
Clearer than water flow’d that juice;
She never tasted such before,
How should it cloy with length of use?
She suck’d and suck’d and suck’d the more
Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
She suck’d until her lips were sore;
Then flung the emptied rinds away
But gather’d up one kernel stone,
And knew not was it night or day
As she turn’d home alone.

         Lizzie met her at the gate
Full of wise upbraidings:
“Dear, you should not stay so late,
Twilight is not good for maidens;
Should not loiter in the glen
In the haunts of goblin men.
Do you not remember Jeanie,
How she met them in the moonlight,
Took their gifts both choice and many,
Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
Pluck’d from bowers
Where summer ripens at all hours?
But ever in the noonlight
She pined and pined away;
Sought them by night and day,
Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;
Then fell with the first snow,
While to this day no grass will grow
Where she lies low:
I planted daisies there a year ago
That never blow.
You should not loiter so.”
“Nay, hush,” said Laura:
“Nay, hush, my sister:
I ate and ate my fill,
Yet my mouth waters still;
To-morrow night I will
Buy more;” and kiss’d her:
“Have done with sorrow;
I’ll bring you plums to-morrow
Fresh on their mother twigs,
Cherries worth getting;
You cannot think what figs
My teeth have met in,
What melons icy-cold
Piled on a dish of gold
Too huge for me to hold,
What peaches with a velvet nap,
Pellucid grapes without one seed:
Odorous indeed must be the mead
Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink
With lilies at the brink,
And sugar-sweet their sap.”

         Golden head by golden head,
Like two pigeons in one nest
Folded in each other’s wings,
They lay down in their curtain’d bed:
Like two blossoms on one stem,
Like two flakes of new-fall’n snow,
Like two wands of ivory
Tipp’d with gold for awful kings.
Moon and stars gaz’d in at them,
Wind sang to them lullaby,
Lumbering owls forbore to fly,
Not a bat flapp’d to and fro
Round their rest:
Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
Lock’d together in one nest.

         Early in the morning
When the first cock crow’d his warning,
Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,
Laura rose with Lizzie:
Fetch’d in honey, milk’d the cows,
Air’d and set to rights the house,
Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,
Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,
Next churn’d butter, whipp’d up cream,
Fed their poultry, sat and sew’d;
Talk’d as modest maidens should:
Lizzie with an open heart,
Laura in an absent dream,
One content, one sick in part;
One warbling for the mere bright day’s delight,
One longing for the night.

         At length slow evening came:
They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
Lizzie most placid in her look,
Laura most like a leaping flame.
They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
Lizzie pluck’d purple and rich golden flags,
Then turning homeward said: “The sunset flushes
Those furthest loftiest crags;
Come, Laura, not another maiden lags.
No wilful squirrel wags,
The beasts and birds are fast asleep.”
But Laura loiter’d still among the rushes
And said the bank was steep.

         And said the hour was early still
The dew not fall’n, the wind not chill;
Listening ever, but not catching
The customary cry,
“Come buy, come buy,”
With its iterated jingle
Of sugar-baited words:
Not for all her watching
Once discerning even one goblin
Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;
Let alone the herds
That used to tramp along the glen,
In groups or single,
Of brisk fruit-merchant men.

         Till Lizzie urged, “O Laura, come;
I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:
You should not loiter longer at this brook:
Come with me home.
The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,
Each glowworm winks her spark,
Let us get home before the night grows dark:
For clouds may gather
Though this is summer weather,
Put out the lights and drench us through;
Then if we lost our way what should we do?”

         Laura turn’d cold as stone
To find her sister heard that cry alone,
That goblin cry,
“Come buy our fruits, come buy.”
Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
Must she no more such succous pasture find,
Gone deaf and blind?
Her tree of life droop’d from the root:
She said not one word in her heart’s sore ache;
But peering thro’ the dimness, nought discerning,
Trudg’d home, her pitcher dripping all the way;
So crept to bed, and lay
Silent till Lizzie slept;
Then sat up in a passionate yearning,
And gnash’d her teeth for baulk’d desire, and wept
As if her heart would break.

         Day after day, night after night,
Laura kept watch in vain
In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
She never caught again the goblin cry:
“Come buy, come buy;”—
She never spied the goblin men
Hawking their fruits along the glen:
But when the noon wax’d bright
Her hair grew thin and grey;
She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn
To swift decay and burn
Her fire away.

         One day remembering her kernel-stone
She set it by a wall that faced the south;
Dew’d it with tears, hoped for a root,
Watch’d for a waxing shoot,
But there came none;
It never saw the sun,
It never felt the trickling moisture run:
While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
She dream’d of melons, as a traveller sees
False waves in desert drouth
With shade of leaf-crown’d trees,
And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.

         She no more swept the house,
Tended the fowls or cows,
Fetch’d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,
Brought water from the brook:
But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
And would not eat.

         Tender Lizzie could not bear
To watch her sister’s cankerous care
Yet not to share.
She night and morning
Caught the goblins’ cry:
“Come buy our orchard fruits,
Come buy, come buy;”—
Beside the brook, along the glen,
She heard the tramp of goblin men,
The yoke and stir
Poor Laura could not hear;
Long’d to buy fruit to comfort her,
But fear’d to pay too dear.
She thought of Jeanie in her grave,
Who should have been a bride;
But who for joys brides hope to have
Fell sick and died
In her gay prime,
In earliest winter time
With the first glazing rime,
With the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.

         Till Laura dwindling
Seem’d knocking at Death’s door:
Then Lizzie weigh’d no more
Better and worse;
But put a silver penny in her purse,
Kiss’d Laura, cross’d the heath with clumps of furze
At twilight, halted by the brook:
And for the first time in her life
Began to listen and look.

         Laugh’d every goblin
When they spied her peeping:
Came towards her hobbling,
Flying, running, leaping,
Puffing and blowing,
Chuckling, clapping, crowing,
Clucking and gobbling,
Mopping and mowing,
Full of airs and graces,
Pulling wry faces,
Demure grimaces,
Cat-like and rat-like,
Ratel- and wombat-like,
Snail-paced in a hurry,
Parrot-voiced and whistler,
Helter skelter, hurry skurry,
Chattering like magpies,
Fluttering like pigeons,
Gliding like fishes,—
Hugg’d her and kiss’d her:
Squeez’d and caress’d her:
Stretch’d up their dishes,
Panniers, and plates:
“Look at our apples
Russet and dun,
Bob at our cherries,
Bite at our peaches,
Citrons and dates,
Grapes for the asking,
Pears red with basking
Out in the sun,
Plums on their twigs;
Pluck them and suck them,
Pomegranates, figs.”—

         “Good folk,” said Lizzie,
Mindful of Jeanie:
“Give me much and many: —
Held out her apron,
Toss’d them her penny.
“Nay, take a seat with us,
Honour and eat with us,”
They answer’d grinning:
“Our feast is but beginning.
Night yet is early,
Warm and dew-pearly,
Wakeful and starry:
Such fruits as these
No man can carry:
Half their bloom would fly,
Half their dew would dry,
Half their flavour would pass by.
Sit down and feast with us,
Be welcome guest with us,
Cheer you and rest with us.”—
“Thank you,” said Lizzie: “But one waits
At home alone for me:
So without further parleying,
If you will not sell me any
Of your fruits though much and many,
Give me back my silver penny
I toss’d you for a fee.”—
They began to scratch their pates,
No longer wagging, purring,
But visibly demurring,
Grunting and snarling.
One call’d her proud,
Cross-grain’d, uncivil;
Their tones wax’d loud,
Their looks were evil.
Lashing their tails
They trod and hustled her,
Elbow’d and jostled her,
Claw’d with their nails,
Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,
Tore her gown and soil’d her stocking,
Twitch’d her hair out by the roots,
Stamp’d upon her tender feet,
Held her hands and squeez’d their fruits
Against her mouth to make her eat.

         White and golden Lizzie stood,
Like a lily in a flood,—
Like a rock of blue-vein’d stone
Lash’d by tides obstreperously,—
Like a beacon left alone
In a hoary roaring sea,
Sending up a golden fire,—
Like a fruit-crown’d orange-tree
White with blossoms honey-sweet
Sore beset by wasp and bee,—
Like a royal virgin town
Topp’d with gilded dome and spire
Close beleaguer’d by a fleet
Mad to tug her standard down.

         One may lead a horse to water,
Twenty cannot make him drink.
Though the goblins cuff’d and caught her,
Coax’d and fought her,
Bullied and besought her,
Scratch’d her, pinch’d her black as ink,
Kick’d and knock’d her,
Maul’d and mock’d her,
Lizzie utter’d not a word;
Would not open lip from lip
Lest they should cram a mouthful in:
But laugh’d in heart to feel the drip
Of juice that syrupp’d all her face,
And lodg’d in dimples of her chin,
And streak’d her neck which quaked like curd.
At last the evil people,
Worn out by her resistance,
Flung back her penny, kick’d their fruit
Along whichever road they took,
Not leaving root or stone or shoot;
Some writh’d into the ground,
Some div’d into the brook
With ring and ripple,
Some scudded on the gale without a sound,
Some vanish’d in the distance.

         In a smart, ache, tingle,
Lizzie went her way;
Knew not was it night or day;
Sprang up the bank, tore thro’ the furze,
Threaded copse and dingle,
And heard her penny jingle
Bouncing in her purse,—
Its bounce was music to her ear.
She ran and ran
As if she fear’d some goblin man
Dogg’d her with gibe or curse
Or something worse:
But not one goblin scurried after,
Nor was she prick’d by fear;
The kind heart made her windy-paced
That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
And inward laughter.

         She cried, “Laura,” up the garden,
“Did you miss me?
Come and kiss me.
Never mind my bruises,
Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices
Squeez’d from goblin fruits for you,
Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
Eat me, drink me, love me;
Laura, make much of me;
For your sake I have braved the glen
And had to do with goblin merchant men.”

         Laura started from her chair,
Flung her arms up in the air,
Clutch’d her hair:
“Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted
For my sake the fruit forbidden?
Must your light like mine be hidden,
Your young life like mine be wasted,
Undone in mine undoing,
And ruin’d in my ruin,
Thirsty, canker’d, goblin-ridden?”—
She clung about her sister,
Kiss’d and kiss’d and kiss’d her:
Tears once again
Refresh’d her shrunken eyes,
Dropping like rain
After long sultry drouth;
Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,
She kiss’d and kiss’d her with a hungry mouth.

         Her lips began to scorch,
That juice was wormwood to her tongue,
She loath’d the feast:
Writhing as one possess’d she leap’d and sung,
Rent all her robe, and wrung
Her hands in lamentable haste,
And beat her breast.
Her locks stream’d like the torch
Borne by a racer at full speed,
Or like the mane of horses in their flight,
Or like an eagle when she stems the light
Straight toward the sun,
Or like a caged thing freed,
Or like a flying flag when armies run.

         Swift fire spread through her veins, knock’d at her heart,
Met the fire smouldering there
And overbore its lesser flame;
She gorged on bitterness without a name:
Ah! fool, to choose such part
Of soul-consuming care!
Sense fail’d in the mortal strife:
Like the watch-tower of a town
Which an earthquake shatters down,
Like a lightning-stricken mast,
Like a wind-uprooted tree
Spun about,
Like a foam-topp’d waterspout
Cast down headlong in the sea,
She fell at last;
Pleasure past and anguish past,
Is it death or is it life?

         Life out of death.
That night long Lizzie watch’d by her,
Counted her pulse’s flagging stir,
Felt for her breath,
Held water to her lips, and cool’d her face
With tears and fanning leaves:
But when the first birds chirp’d about their eaves,
And early reapers plodded to the place
Of golden sheaves,
And dew-wet grass
Bow’d in the morning winds so brisk to pass,
And new buds with new day
Open’d of cup-like lilies on the stream,
Laura awoke as from a dream,
Laugh’d in the innocent old way,
Hugg’d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
Her gleaming locks show’d not one thread of grey,
Her breath was sweet as May
And light danced in her eyes.

         Days, weeks, months, years
Afterwards, when both were wives
With children of their own;
Their mother-hearts beset with fears,
Their lives bound up in tender lives;
Laura would call the little ones
And tell them of her early prime,
Those pleasant days long gone
Of not-returning time:
Would talk about the haunted glen,
The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,
Their fruits like honey to the throat
But poison in the blood;
(Men sell not such in any town):
Would tell them how her sister stood
In deadly peril to do her good,
And win the fiery antidote:
Then joining hands to little hands
Would bid them cling together,
“For there is no friend like a sister
In calm or stormy weather;
To cheer one on the tedious way,
To fetch one if one goes astray,
To lift one if one totters down,
To strengthen whilst one stands.”",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Activities', 'Eating & Drinking', 'Relationships', 'Pets', 'Philosophy', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Ghosts & the Supernatural', 'Couplet', 'Simile', 'Imagery', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44996/goblin-market,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/christina-rossetti,,1830.0,1894.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Lewis Carroll,1832–1898,The Hunting of the Snark,"Fit the First
            The Landing

""Just the place for a Snark!"" the Bellman cried,
   As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
   By a finger entwined in his hair.

""Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
   That alone should encourage the crew.
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
   What I tell you three times is true.""

The crew was complete: it included a Boots—
   A maker of Bonnets and Hoods—
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—
   And a Broker, to value their goods.

A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
   Might perhaps have won more than his share—
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
   Had the whole of their cash in his care.

There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
   Or would sit making lace in the bow:
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
   Though none of the sailors knew how.

There was one who was famed for the number of things
   He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
   And the clothes he had bought for the trip.

He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
   With his name painted clearly on each:
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
   They were all left behind on the beach.

The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
   He had seven coats on when he came,
With three pair of boots—but the worst of it was,
   He had wholly forgotten his name.

He would answer to ""Hi!"" or to any loud cry,
   Such as ""Fry me!"" or ""Fritter my wig!""
To ""What-you-may-call-um!"" or ""What-was-his-name!""
   But especially ""Thing-um-a-jig!""

While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
   He had different names from these:
His intimate friends called him ""Candle-ends,""
   And his enemies ""Toasted-cheese.""

""His form is ungainly—his intellect small—""
   (So the Bellman would often remark)
""But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,
   Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.""

He would joke with hænas, returning their stare
   With an impudent wag of the head:
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
   ""Just to keep up its spirits,"" he said.

He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late—
   And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad—
He could only bake Bride-cake—for which, I may state,
   No materials were to be had.

The last of the crew needs especial remark,
   Though he looked an incredible dunce:
He had just one idea—but, that one being ""Snark,""
   The good Bellman engaged him at once.

He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
   When the ship had been sailing a week,
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
   And was almost too frightened to speak:

But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
   There was only one Beaver on board;
And that was a tame one he had of his own,
   Whose death would be deeply deplored.

The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
   Protested, with tears in its eyes,
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
   Could atone for that dismal surprise!

It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
   Conveyed in a separate ship:
But the Bellman declared that would never agree
   With the plans he had made for the trip:

Navigation was always a difficult art,
   Though with only one ship and one bell:
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
   Undertaking another as well.

The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
   A second-hand dagger-proof coat—
So the Baker advised it—and next, to insure
   Its life in some Office of note:

This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
   (On moderate terms), or for sale,
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
   And one Against Damage From Hail.

Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
   Whenever the Butcher was by,
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
   And appeared unaccountably shy.

                  Fit the Second
                      The Bellman's Speech

The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies—
   Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
   The moment one looked in his face!

He had bought a large map representing the sea,
   Without the least vestige of land:
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
   A map they could all understand.

""What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
   Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?""
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
   ""They are merely conventional signs!

""Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
   But we've got our brave Captain to thank
(So the crew would protest) ""that he's bought us the best—
   A perfect and absolute blank!""

This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out
   That the Captain they trusted so well
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
   And that was to tingle his bell.

He was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave
   Were enough to bewilder a crew.
When he cried ""Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!""
   What on earth was the helmsman to do?

Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
   A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
That frequently happens in tropical climes,
   When a vessel is, so to speak, ""snarked.""

But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
   And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
   That the ship would not travel due West!

But the danger was past—they had landed at last,
   With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
   Which consisted of chasms and crags.

The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
   And repeated in musical tone
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe—
   But the crew would do nothing but groan.

He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
   And bade them sit down on the beach:
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
   As he stood and delivered his speech.

""Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!""
   (They were all of them fond of quotations:
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,
   While he served out additional rations).

""We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
   (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
   Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!

""We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
   (Seven days to the week I allow),
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
   We have never beheld till now!

""Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
   The five unmistakable marks
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
   The warranted genuine Snarks.

""Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,
   Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
   With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp.

""Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
   That it carries too far, when I say
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,
   And dines on the following day.

""The third is its slowness in taking a jest.
   Should you happen to venture on one,
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
   And it always looks grave at a pun.

""The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
   Which it constantly carries about,
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes—
   A sentiment open to doubt.

""The fifth is ambition. It next will be right
   To describe each particular batch:
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
   From those that have whiskers, and scratch.

""For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
   Yet, I feel it my duty to say,
Some are Boojums—"" The Bellman broke off in alarm,
   For the Baker had fainted away.

            Fit the Third
               The Baker's Tale

They roused him with muffins—they roused him with ice—
   They roused him with mustard and cress—
They roused him with jam and judicious advice—
   They set him conundrums to guess.

When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
   His sad story he offered to tell;
And the Bellman cried ""Silence! Not even a shriek!""
   And excitedly tingled his bell.

There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,
   Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
As the man they called ""Ho!"" told his story of woe
   In an antediluvian tone.

""My father and mother were honest, though poor—""
   ""Skip all that!"" cried the Bellman in haste.
""If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark—
   We have hardly a minute to waste!""

""I skip forty years,"" said the Baker, in tears,
   ""And proceed without further remark
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
   To help you in hunting the Snark.

""A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
   Remarked, when I bade him farewell—""
""Oh, skip your dear uncle!"" the Bellman exclaimed,
   As he angrily tingled his bell.

""He remarked to me then,"" said that mildest of men,
   ""'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
Fetch it home by all means—you may serve it with greens,
   And it's handy for striking a light.

""'You may seek it with thimbles—and seek it with care;
   You may hunt it with forks and hope;
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
   You may charm it with smiles and soap—'""

(""That's exactly the method,"" the Bellman bold
   In a hasty parenthesis cried,
""That's exactly the way I have always been told
   That the capture of Snarks should be tried!"")

""'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
   If your Snark be a Boojum! For then
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
   And never be met with again!'

""It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
   When I think of my uncle's last words:
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
   Brimming over with quivering curds!

""It is this, it is this—"" ""We have had that before!""
   The Bellman indignantly said.
And the Baker replied ""Let me say it once more.
   It is this, it is this that I dread!

""I engage with the Snark—every night after dark—
   In a dreamy delirious fight:
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
   And I use it for striking a light:

""But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
   In a moment (of this I am sure),
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away—
   And the notion I cannot endure!""

            Fit the Fourth
               The Hunting

The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.
   ""If only you'd spoken before!
It's excessively awkward to mention it now,
   With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!

""We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,
   If you never were met with again—
But surely, my man, when the voyage began,
   You might have suggested it then?

""It's excessively awkward to mention it now—
   As I think I've already remarked.""
And the man they called ""Hi!"" replied, with a sigh,
   ""I informed you the day we embarked.

""You may charge me with murder—or want of sense—
   (We are all of us weak at times):
But the slightest approach to a false pretence
   Was never among my crimes!

""I said it in Hebrew—I said it in Dutch—
   I said it in German and Greek:
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)
   That English is what you speak!""

""'Tis a pitiful tale,"" said the Bellman, whose face
   Had grown longer at every word:
""But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,
   More debate would be simply absurd.

""The rest of my speech"" (he explained to his men)
   ""You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!
   'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!

""To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;
   To pursue it with forks and hope;
To threaten its life with a railway-share;
   To charm it with smiles and soap!

""For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't
   Be caught in a commonplace way.
Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:
   Not a chance must be wasted to-day!

""For England expects—I forbear to proceed:
   'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:
And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need
   To rig yourselves out for the fight.""

Then the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he crossed),
   And changed his loose silver for notes.
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,
   And shook the dust out of his coats.

The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade—
   Each working the grindstone in turn:
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
   No interest in the concern:

Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
   And vainly proceeded to cite
A number of cases, in which making laces
   Had been proved an infringement of right.

The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned
   A novel arrangement of bows:
While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand
   Was chalking the tip of his nose.

But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,
   With yellow kid gloves and a ruff—
Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,
   Which the Bellman declared was all ""stuff.""

""Introduce me, now there's a good fellow,"" he said,
   ""If we happen to meet it together!""
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,
   Said ""That must depend on the weather.""

The Beaver went simply galumphing about,
   At seeing the Butcher so shy:
And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,
   Made an effort to wink with one eye.

""Be a man!"" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard
   The Butcher beginning to sob.
""Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,
   We shall need all our strength for the job!""

             Fit the Fifth
               The Beaver's Lesson

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
   They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.

Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
   For making a separate sally;
And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
   A dismal and desolate valley.

But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
   It had chosen the very same place:
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
   The disgust that appeared in his face.

Each thought he was thinking of nothing but ""Snark""
   And the glorious work of the day;
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
   That the other was going that way.

But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
   And the evening got darker and colder,
Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)
   They marched along shoulder to shoulder.

Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
   And they knew that some danger was near:
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
   And even the Butcher felt queer.

He thought of his childhood, left far far behind—
   That blissful and innocent state—
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
   A pencil that squeaks on a slate!

""'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!"" he suddenly cried.
   (This man, that they used to call ""Dunce."")
""As the Bellman would tell you,"" he added with pride,
   ""I have uttered that sentiment once.

""'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;
   You will find I have told it you twice.
Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,
   If only I've stated it thrice.""

The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
   Attending to every word:
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
   When the third repetition occurred.

It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
   It had somehow contrived to lose count,
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
   By reckoning up the amount.

""Two added to one—if that could but be done,""
   It said, ""with one's fingers and thumbs!""
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
   It had taken no pains with its sums.

""The thing can be done,"" said the Butcher, ""I think.
   The thing must be done, I am sure.
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,
   The best there is time to procure.""

The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,
   And ink in unfailing supplies:
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
   And watched them with wondering eyes.

So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
   As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
And explained all the while in a popular style
   Which the Beaver could well understand.

""Taking Three as the subject to reason about—
   A convenient number to state—
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
   By One Thousand diminished by Eight.

""The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
   By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
   Exactly and perfectly true.

""The method employed I would gladly explain,
   While I have it so clear in my head,
If I had but the time and you had but the brain—
   But much yet remains to be said.

""In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
   Enveloped in absolute mystery,
And without extra charge I will give you at large
   A Lesson in Natural History.""

In his genial way he proceeded to say
   (Forgetting all laws of propriety,
And that giving instruction, without introduction,
   Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

""As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
   Since it lives in perpetual passion:
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd—
   It is ages ahead of the fashion:

""But it knows any friend it has met once before:
   It never will look at a bribe:
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
   And collects—though it does not subscribe.

""Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
   Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
   And some, in mahogany kegs:)

""You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
   You condense it with locusts and tape:
Still keeping one principal object in view—
   To preserve its symmetrical shape.""

The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
   But he felt that the Lesson must end,
And he wept with delight in attempting to say
   He considered the Beaver his friend.

While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
   More eloquent even than tears,
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
   Would have taught it in seventy years.

They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
   (For a moment) with noble emotion,
Said ""This amply repays all the wearisome days
   We have spent on the billowy ocean!""

Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
   Have seldom if ever been known;
In winter or summer, 'twas always the same—
   You could never meet either alone.

And when quarrels arose—as one frequently finds
   Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour—
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
   And cemented their friendship for ever!

            Fit the Sixth
               The Barrister's Dream

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
   They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.

But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
   That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
   That his fancy had dwelt on so long.

He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
   Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
   On the charge of deserting its sty.

The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
   That the sty was deserted when found:
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
   In a soft under-current of sound.

The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
   And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
   What the pig was supposed to have done.

The Jury had each formed a different view
   (Long before the indictment was read),
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
   One word that the others had said.

""You must know—"" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed ""Fudge!""
   That statute is obsolete quite!
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
   On an ancient manorial right.

""In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
   To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
   If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'

""The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;
   But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)
   By the Alibi which has been proved.

""My poor client's fate now depends on your votes.""
   Here the speaker sat down in his place,
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
   And briefly to sum up the case.

But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
   So the Snark undertook it instead,
And summed it so well that it came to far more
   Than the Witnesses ever had said!

When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
   As the word was so puzzling to spell;
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
   Undertaking that duty as well.

So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
   It was spent with the toils of the day:
When it said the word ""GUILTY!"" the Jury all groaned,
   And some of them fainted away.

Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
   Too nervous to utter a word:
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
   And the fall of a pin might be heard.

""Transportation for life"" was the sentence it gave,
   ""And then to be fined forty pound.""
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
   That the phrase was not legally sound.

But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
   When the jailer informed them, with tears,
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
   As the pig had been dead for some years.

The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
   But the Snark, though a little aghast,
As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,
   Went bellowing on to the last.

Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
   To grow every moment more clear:
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
   Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.

            Fit the Seventh
               The Banker's Fate

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
   They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.

And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
   It was matter for general remark,
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
   In his zeal to discover the Snark

But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
   A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
   For he knew it was useless to fly.

He offered large discount—he offered a cheque
   (Drawn ""to bearer"") for seven-pounds-ten:
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
   And grabbed at the Banker again.

Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws
   Went savagely snapping around—
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
   Till fainting he fell to the ground.

The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
   Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
And the Bellman remarked ""It is just as I feared!""
   And solemnly tolled on his bell.

He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
   The least likeness to what he had been:
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white—
   A wonderful thing to be seen!

To the horror of all who were present that day,
   He uprose in full evening dress,
And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
   What his tongue could no longer express.

Down he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair—
   And chanted in mimsiest tones
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
   While he rattled a couple of bones.

""Leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late!""
   The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
""We have lost half the day. Any further delay,
   And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night!""

            Fit the Eighth
               The Vanishing

They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
   They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a railway-share;
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.

They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,
   And the Beaver, excited at last,
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,
   For the daylight was nearly past.

""There is Thingumbob shouting!"" the Bellman said,
   ""He is shouting like mad, only hark!
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
   He has certainly found a Snark!""

They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed
   ""He was always a desperate wag!""
They beheld him—their Baker—their hero unnamed—
   On the top of a neighbouring crag,

Erect and sublime, for one moment of time,
   In the next, that wild figure they saw
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,
   While they waited and listened in awe.

""It's a Snark!"" was the sound that first came to their ears,
   And seemed almost too good to be true.
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
   Then the ominous words ""It's a Boo—""

Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air
   A weary and wandering sigh
That sounded like ""-jum!"" but the others declare
   It was only a breeze that went by.

They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
   Not a button, or feather, or mark,
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
   Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
   In the midst of his laughter and glee,
He had softly and suddenly vanished away—
   For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.",ballad,verse forms,"['Suitable for Children', 'Suitable for Teens', 'Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Humor & Satire', 'Ballad']","Source:

Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,1836–1919,"Hearing the Battle.—July 21, 1861","One day in the dreamy summer,
     On the Sabbath hills, from afar
 We heard the solemn echoes
     Of the first fierce words of war.
  
 Ah, tell me, thou veilèd Watcher
     Of the storm and the calm to come,
 How long by the sun or shadow
     Till these noises again are dumb.
  
 And soon in a hush and glimmer
     We thought of the dark, strange fight,
 Whose close in a ghastly quiet
     Lay dim in the beautiful night.
  
 Then we talk’d of coldness and pallor,
     And of things with blinded eyes
 That stared at the golden stillness
     Of the moon in those lighted skies;
  
 And of souls, at morning wrestling
     In the dust with passion and moan,
 So far away at evening
     In the silence of worlds unknown.
  
 But a delicate wind beside us
     Was rustling the dusky hours,
 As it gather’d the dewy odors
     Of the snowy jessamine-flowers.

 How the hearts in the land are breaking,

Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,1836–1919,Army of Occupation,"At Arlington, 1866

The summer blew its little drifts of sound—
     Tangled with wet leaf-shadows and the light
 Small breath of scattered morning buds—around
 The yellow path through which our footsteps wound.
     Below, the Capitol rose glittering white.
  
 There stretched a sleeping army. One by one,
     They took their places until thousands met;
 No leader’s stars flashed on before, and none
 Leaned on his sword or stagger’d with his gun—
     I wonder if their feet have rested yet!
  
 They saw the dust, they joined the moving mass,
     They answer’d the fierce music’s cry for blood,
 Then straggled here and lay down in the grass:—
 Wear flowers for such, shores whence their feet did pass;
     Sing tenderly; O river’s haunted flood!
  
 They had been sick, and worn, and weary, when
     They stopp’d on this calm hill beneath the trees:
 Yet if, in some red-clouded dawn, again
 The country should be calling to her men,
     Shall the r[e]veill[e] not remember these?
  
 Around them underneath the mid-day skies
     The dreadful phantoms of the living walk,
 And by low moons and darkness with their cries—
 The mothers, sisters, wives with faded eyes,
     Who call still names amid their broken talk.
  
 And there is one who comes alone and stands
     At his dim fireless hearth—chill’d and oppress’d
 By Something he had summon’d to his lands,
 While the weird pallor of its many hands
     Points to his rusted sword in his own breast!",quatrain,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Quatrain']","Source:

Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,1836–1919,Giving Back the Flower,"So, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night,
    And to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair,
Till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight,
    And to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,
 
Say, must you taunt me forever, forever? You looked at my hand and you knew
    That I was the slave of the Ring, while you were as free as the wind is free.
When I saw your corpse in your coffin, I flung back your flower to you;
    It was all of yours that I ever had; you may keep it, and—keep from me.
 
Ah? so God is your witness. Has God, then, no world to look after but ours?
    May He not have been searching for that wild star, with the trailing plumage, that
        flew
Far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers,
    Or else brightening some planet’s luminous rings, instead of thinking of you?
 
Or, if He was near us at all, do you think that He would sit listening there
    Because you sang “Hear me, Norma,” to a woman in jewels and lace,
While, so close to us, down in another street, in the wet, unlighted air,
    There were children crying for bread and fire, and mothers who questioned His
        grace?
 
Or perhaps He had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day,
    To number the bloody stabs that were there, to look at and judge the dead;
Or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay;
    At least I do not believe that He cares to remember a word that you said.
 
So take back your flowers, I tell you—of its sweetness I now have no need;
    Yes; take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep;
When you wake I will take it, and God, then, perhaps will witness indeed,
    But go, now, and tell Death he must watch you, and not let you walk in your sleep.",quatrain,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Rhymed Stanza', 'Quatrain']","Source:

     In the old, old dark so sweet,
 (I shall never hear it again,)

 Now it comes in a phantom moan

 Oh, what a wizard touch it had—
     Oh, if I could hear it still!

     The music had made them free.
 They were happy women and men—
     What more do we care to be?
  
 There is blood and blackness and dust,
     There are terrible things to see,
 There are stories of swords that rust,
     Between that music and me.
  
 Dark ghosts with your ghostly tunes
     Come back till I laugh through tears;
 Dance under the sunken moons,

 Nay, make no ambush of the dark.

     And you must the betrayer be,
 Oh, marked before the worlds were made!

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,The Complaint of Lisa,"(Double Sestina) 
 
DECAMERON, x. 7

There is no woman living that draws breath 
So sad as I, though all things sadden her. 
There is not one upon life's weariest way 
Who is weary as I am weary of all but death. 
Toward whom I look as looks the sunflower 
All day with all his whole soul toward the sun; 
While in the sun's sight I make moan all day, 
And all night on my sleepless maiden bed 
Weep and call out on death, O Love, and thee, 
That thou or he would take me to the dead, 
And know not what thing evil I have done 
That life should lay such heavy hand on me. 
 
Alas, Love, what is this thou wouldst with me? 
What honour shalt thou have to quench my breath, 
Or what shall my heart broken profit thee? 
O Love, O great god Love, what have I done, 
That thou shouldst hunger so after my death? 
My heart is harmless as my life's first day: 
Seek out some false fair woman, and plague her 
Till her tears even as my tears fill her bed: 
I am the least flower in thy flowery way, 
But till my time be come that I be dead 
Let me live out my flower-time in the sun 
Though my leaves shut before the sunflower. 
 
O Love, Love, Love, the kingly sunflower! 
Shall he the sun hath looked on look on me, 
That live down here in shade, out of the sun, 
Here living in the sorrow and shadow of death? 
Shall he that feeds his heart full of the day 
Care to give mine eyes light, or my lips breath? 
Because she loves him shall my lord love her 
Who is as a worm in my lord's kingly way? 
I shall not see him or know him alive or dead; 
But thou, I know thee, O Love, and pray to thee 
That in brief while my brief life-days be done, 
And the worm quickly make my marriage-bed. 
 
For underground there is no sleepless bed: 
But here since I beheld my sunflower 
These eyes have slept not, seeing all night and day 
His sunlike eyes, and face fronting the sun. 
Wherefore if anywhere be any death, 
I would fain find and fold him fast to me, 
That I may sleep with the world's eldest dead, 
With her that died seven centuries since, and her 
That went last night down the night-wandering way. 
For this is sleep indeed, when labour is done, 
Without love, without dreams, and without breath, 
And without thought, O name unnamed! of thee. 
 
Ah, but, forgetting all things, shall I thee? 
Wilt thou not be as now about my bed 
There underground as here before the sun? 
Shall not thy vision vex me alive and dead, 
Thy moving vision without form or breath? 
I read long since the bitter tale of her 
Who read the tale of Launcelot on a day, 
And died, and had no quiet after death, 
But was moved ever along a weary way, 
Lost with her love in the underworld; ah me, 
O my king, O my lordly sunflower, 
Would God to me too such a thing were done! 
 
But if such sweet and bitter things be done, 
Then, flying from life, I shall not fly from thee. 
For in that living world without a sun 
Thy vision will lay hold upon me dead, 
And meet and mock me, and mar my peace in death. 
Yet if being wroth God had such pity on her, 
Who was a sinner and foolish in her day, 
That even in hell they twain should breathe one breath, 
Why should he not in some wise pity me? 
So if I sleep not in my soft strait bed 
I may look up and see my sunflower 
As he the sun, in some divine strange way. 
 
O poor my heart, well knowest thou in what way 
This sore sweet evil unto us was done. 
For on a holy and a heavy day 
I was arisen out of my still small bed 
To see the knights tilt, and one said to me 
""The king,"" and seeing him, somewhat stopped my breath, 
And if the girl spake more, I heard not her, 
For only I saw what I shall see when dead, 
A kingly flower of knights, a sunflower, 
That shone against the sunlight like the sun, 
And like a fire, O heart, consuming thee, 
The fire of love that lights the pyre of death. 
 
Howbeit I shall not die an evil death 
Who have loved in such a sad and sinless way, 
That this my love, lord, was no shame to thee. 
So when mine eyes are shut against the sun, 
O my soul's sun, O the world's sunflower, 
Thou nor no man will quite despise me dead. 
And dying I pray with all my low last breath 
That thy whole life may be as was that day, 
That feast-day that made trothplight death and me, 
Giving the world light of thy great deeds done; 
And that fair face brightening thy bridal bed, 
That God be good as God hath been to her. 
 
That all things goodly and glad remain with her, 
All things that make glad life and goodly death; 
That as a bee sucks from a sunflower 
Honey, when summer draws delighted breath, 
Her soul may drink of thy soul in like way, 
And love make life a fruitful marriage-bed 
Where day may bring forth fruits of joy to day 
And night to night till days and nights be dead. 
And as she gives light of her love to thee, 
Give thou to her the old glory of days long done; 
And either give some heat of light to me, 
To warm me where I sleep without the sun. 
 
O sunflower made drunken with the sun, 
O knight whose lady's heart draws thine to her, 
Great king, glad lover, I have a word to thee. 
There is a weed lives out of the sun's way, 
Hid from the heat deep in the meadow's bed, 
That swoons and whitens at the wind's least breath, 
A flower star-shaped, that all a summer day 
Will gaze her soul out on the sunflower 
For very love till twilight finds her dead. 
But the great sunflower heeds not her poor death, 
Knows not when all her loving life is done; 
And so much knows my lord the king of me. 
 
Aye, all day long he has no eye for me; 
With golden eye following the golden sun 
From rose-coloured to purple-pillowed bed, 
From birthplace to the flame-lit place of death, 
From eastern end to western of his way. 
So mine eye follows thee, my sunflower, 
So the white star-flower turns and yearns to thee, 
The sick weak weed, not well alive or dead, 
Trod underfoot if any pass by her, 
Pale, without colour of summer or summer breath 
In the shrunk shuddering petals, that have done 
No work but love, and die before the day. 
 
But thou, to-day, to-morrow, and every day, 
Be glad and great, O love whose love slays me. 
Thy fervent flower made fruitful from the sun 
Shall drop its golden seed in the world's way, 
That all men thereof nourished shall praise thee 
For grain and flower and fruit of works well done; 
Till thy shed seed, O shining sunflower, 
Bring forth such growth of the world's garden-bed 
As like the sun shall outlive age and death. 
And yet I would thine heart had heed of her 
Who loves thee alive; but not till she be dead. 
Come, Love, then, quickly, and take her utmost breath. 
 
Song, speak for me who am dumb as are the dead; 
From my sad bed of tears I send forth thee, 
To fly all day from sun's birth to sun's death 
Down the sun's way after the flying sun, 
For love of her that gave thee wings and breath, 
Ere day be done, to seek the sunflower.",sestina,verse forms,"['Living', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Realistic & Complicated', 'Relationships', 'Sestina', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45281/the-complaint-of-lisa,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,A Sequence of Sonnets on the Death of Robert Browning,"I 
The clearest eyes in all the world they read 
       With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true 
       Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew 
Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, 
As they the light of ages quick and dead, 
       Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew 
       Can slay not one of all the works we knew, 
Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. 
 
The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, 
And moulded of unconquerable thought, 
       And quickened with imperishable flame, 
Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought 
       May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame, 
       Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name. 
 
II 
Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom 
       Time is not lord, but servant? What least part 
       Of all the fire that fed his living heart, 
Of all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom 
That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom 
       And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart 
       Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, 
A shadow born of terror's barren womb, 
That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, 
To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow, 
       That power on him is given thee,—that thy breath 
Can make him less than love acclaims him now, 
       And hears all time sound back the word it saith? 
       What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? 
 
III 
A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve: 
       Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand, 
       Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand 
And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. 
A graceless guerdon we that loved receive 
       For all our love, from that the dearest land 
       Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, 
Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, 
Shone on our dreams and memories evermore 
The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore 
       That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black 
Seems now the face we loved as he of yore. 
       We have given thee love—no stint, no stay, no lack: 
       What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? 
 
IV 
But he—to him, who knows what gift is thine, 
       Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we 
       Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, 
Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine 
And darken round such dreams as half divine 
       Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea 
       Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, 
To read with him the secret of thy shrine. 
 
There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, 
The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove, 
       Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky 
Till all beneath wax bright as all above: 
       But none of all that search the heavens, and try 
       The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye. 
 
V 
Among the wondrous ways of men and time 
       He went as one that ever found and sought 
       And bore in hand the lamp-like spirit of thought 
To illume with instance of its fire sublime 
The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime. 
       No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought, 
       No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought 
That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, 
No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, 
No love more lovely than the snows are white, 
       No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, 
No song-bird singing from some live soul's height, 
       But he might hear, interpret, or illume 
       With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. 
 
VI 
What secret thing of splendour or of shade 
       Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein 
       Man, led of love and life and death and sin, 
Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, 
Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade 
       Of that full soul that had for aim to win 
       Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, 
Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? 
O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee 
That he might know not of in spirit, and see 
       The heart within the heart that seems to strive, 
The life within the life that seems to be, 
       And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive, 
       The living sound of all men's souls alive? 
 
VII 
He held no dream worth waking: so he said, 
       He who stands now on death's triumphal steep, 
       Awakened out of life wherein we sleep 
And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. 
But never death for him was dark or dread: 
       ""Look forth"" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep, 
       All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep 
Vain memory's vision of a vanished head 
As all that lives of all that once was he 
Save that which lightens from his word: but we, 
       Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, 
Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea, 
       Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole, 
       And life and death but shadows of the soul.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Elegy', 'Sonnet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45303/a-sequence-of-sonnets-on-the-death-of-robert-browning,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,A Ballad of Death,"Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears, 
Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth 
Upon the sides of mirth, 
Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears 
Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing; 
Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs 
Upon the flesh to cleave, 
Set pains therein and many a grievous thing, 
And many sorrows after each his wise 
For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve. 
 
O Love's lute heard about the lands of death, 
Left hanged upon the trees that were therein; 
O Love and Time and Sin, 
Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath, 
Three lovers, each one evil spoken of; 
O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine 
Came softer with her praise; 
Abide a little for our lady's love. 
The kisses of her mouth were more than wine, 
And more than peace the passage of her days. 
 
O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see. 
O Time, thou shalt not find in any land 
Till, cast out of thine hand, 
The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee, 
Another woman fashioned like as this. 
O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her 
Was made a goodly thing; 
Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss, 
With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier 
Than lips of amorous roses in late spring. 
 
By night there stood over against my bed 
Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black, 
Both sides drawn fully back 
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red, 
And temples drained of purple and full of death. 
Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water 
And the sea's gold in it. 
Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth. 
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her, 
And pearl and purple and amber on her feet. 
 
Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline 
Were painted all the secret ways of love 
And covered things thereof, 
That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine; 
Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves, 
And brides that kept within the bride-chamber 
Their garment of soft shame, 
And weeping faces of the wearied loves 
That swoon in sleep and awake wearier, 
With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame. 
 
The tears that through her eyelids fell on me 
Made mine own bitter where they ran between 
As blood had fallen therein, 
She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see 
If any glad thing be or any good 
Now the best thing is taken forth of us; 
Even she to whom all praise 
Was as one flower in a great multitude, 
One glorious flower of many and glorious, 
One day found gracious among many days: 
 
Even she whose handmaiden was Love—to whom 
At kissing times across her stateliest bed 
Kings bowed themselves and shed 
Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb, 
And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering; 
Even she between whose lips the kiss became 
As fire and frankincense; 
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king, 
Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame, 
Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence. 
 
Then I beheld, and lo on the other side 
My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead. 
Sweet still, but now not red, 
Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died. 
And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade, 
The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes. 
And sweet, but like spoilt gold, 
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed. 
And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes, 
The body that was clothed with love of old. 
 
Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair 
And all the hollow bosom of her gown— 
Ah! that my tears ran down 
Even to the place where many kisses were, 
Even where her parted breast-flowers have place, 
Even where they are cloven apart—who knows not this? 
Ah! the flowers cleave apart 
And their sweet fills the tender interspace; 
Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss 
Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart. 
 
Ah! in the days when God did good to me, 
Each part about her was a righteous thing; 
Her mouth an almsgiving, 
The glory of her garments charity, 
The beauty of her bosom a good deed, 
In the good days when God kept sight of us; 
Love lay upon her eyes, 
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed; 
And all her body was more virtuous 
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise. 
 
Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands 
And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves 
Rain-rotten in rank lands, 
Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves 
And grass that fades ere any of it be mown; 
And when thy bosom is filled full thereof 
Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth, 
And say ""My master that was thrall to Love 
Is become thrall to Death."" 
Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan. 
But make no sojourn in thy outgoing; 
For haply it may be 
That when thy feet return at evening 
Death shall come in with thee.",ballad,verse forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Ballad', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45277/a-ballad-of-death,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,Hymn to Proserpine (After the Proclamation in Rome of the Christian Faith),"Vicisti, Galilæe.

I have lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love hath an end; 
Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. 
Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh or that weep; 
For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep. 
Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove; 
But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love. 
Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold, 
A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold? 
I am sick of singing; the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain 
To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain. 
For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath, 
We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death. 
O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day! 
From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say. 
New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods; 
They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate Gods. 
But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; 
Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. 
Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, 
Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. 
I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at peace, 
Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease. 
Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take, 
The laurel, the palms and the pæan, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake; 
Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath; 
And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death; 
All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, 
Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire. 
More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things? 
Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings. 
A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? 
For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. 
And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears: 
Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? 
Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; 
We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death. 
Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; 
But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May. 
Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end; 
For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. 
Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; 
But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides. 
O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods! 
O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods! 
Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend, 
I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end. 
All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast 
Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past: 
Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates, 
Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: 
Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings, 
And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things, 
White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled, 
Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world. 
The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; 
In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey; 
In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears; 
With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: 
With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour; 
And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour: 
And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be; 
And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea: 
And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air: 
And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare. 
Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods? 
Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye Gods? 
All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past; 
Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last. 
In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things, 
Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings. 
Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod, 
Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a God, 
Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head, 
Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead. 
Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around; 
Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned. 
Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these. 
Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas, 
Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam, 
And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome. 
For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, 
Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers, 
White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame, 
Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name. 
For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she 
Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea. 
And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways, 
And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays. 
Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wise that ye should not fall. 
Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all. 
But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end; 
Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend. 
O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth, 
I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth. 
In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art, 
Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart, 
Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white, 
And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night, 
And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from afar 
Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star, 
In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun, 
Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone. 
Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal breath; 
Let these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death. 
Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I know 
I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep; even so. 
For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span; 
A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man. 
So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep. 
For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a sleep.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Religion', 'Christianity', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Greek & Roman Mythology', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45292/hymn-to-proserpine-after-the-proclamation-in-rome-of-the-christian-faith,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Body and spirit are twins: God only knows which is which:

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,March: An Ode,"I
Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight,
The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight;
The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed
Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade
That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night,
Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made,
March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite.

II
And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow,
And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low,
How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born
So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn?
Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow
As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn,
Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow.

III
Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed,
Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed
Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as flowers,
Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it showers,
But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed,
As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an hour's,
One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed.

IV
As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to May;
So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away,
And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but thou,
Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us now?
For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that play,
Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow
Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey.

V
Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea?
Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee
Now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath?
Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning? the word that the changed year saith,
Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we
Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was death
And kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world free?

VI
For the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy song,
Glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong,
Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births divine,
Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for wine,
And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier throng,
And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine,
And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong.

VII
Thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's arch,
And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the larch:
Wild April, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow,
Calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow,
And his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame parch;
For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow,
And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of March.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Spring', 'Weather', 'Ode', 'Couplet']","Algernon Charles Swineburne.

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,A Channel Crossing,"Forth from Calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone, 
Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone: 
Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour 
Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower, 
Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the star-bright air 
Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair. 
Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish awoke in the dark? 
Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark. 
Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky, 
Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die. 
Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire: 
Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire. 
 
And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free: 
And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea. 
All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught: 
And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught. 
And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind: 
And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind. 
Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce East, 
Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest. 
The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free 
Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea. 
As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall, 
The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall. 
Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath, 
And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death. 
Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy, 
Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy. 
For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime 
As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time. 
The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard, 
The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word, 
In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea, 
And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free. 
Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light 
From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white. 
The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade 
From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made. 
Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune, 
Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon. 
The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep 
As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep. 
All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know 
Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below. 
The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage, 
Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage. 
No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare, 
Illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air— 
Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's, 
Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees. 
No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams 
Than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems— 
One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides 
As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides. 
In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld 
As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled. 
As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn 
Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn. 
A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning sea, 
And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be; 
As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep, 
Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep: 
Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake: 
Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake, 
In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour, 
A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower. 
And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed 
When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed. 
The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died, 
Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride; 
With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth, 
As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new God's birth, 
The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell: 
And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell. 
The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain, 
For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain. 
And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife; 
And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Nature', 'Seas, Rivers, & Streams', 'Couplet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45279/a-channel-crossing,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,The Garden of Proserpine,"Here, where the world is quiet; 
         Here, where all trouble seems 
Dead winds' and spent waves' riot 
         In doubtful dreams of dreams; 
I watch the green field growing 
For reaping folk and sowing, 
For harvest-time and mowing, 
         A sleepy world of streams. 
 
I am tired of tears and laughter, 
         And men that laugh and weep; 
Of what may come hereafter 
         For men that sow to reap: 
I am weary of days and hours, 
Blown buds of barren flowers, 
Desires and dreams and powers 
         And everything but sleep. 
 
Here life has death for neighbour, 
         And far from eye or ear 
Wan waves and wet winds labour, 
         Weak ships and spirits steer; 
They drive adrift, and whither 
They wot not who make thither; 
But no such winds blow hither, 
         And no such things grow here. 
 
No growth of moor or coppice, 
         No heather-flower or vine, 
But bloomless buds of poppies, 
         Green grapes of Proserpine, 
Pale beds of blowing rushes 
Where no leaf blooms or blushes 
Save this whereout she crushes 
         For dead men deadly wine. 
 
Pale, without name or number, 
         In fruitless fields of corn, 
They bow themselves and slumber 
         All night till light is born; 
And like a soul belated, 
In hell and heaven unmated, 
By cloud and mist abated 
         Comes out of darkness morn. 
 
Though one were strong as seven, 
         He too with death shall dwell, 
Nor wake with wings in heaven, 
         Nor weep for pains in hell; 
Though one were fair as roses, 
His beauty clouds and closes; 
And well though love reposes, 
         In the end it is not well. 
 
Pale, beyond porch and portal, 
         Crowned with calm leaves, she stands 
Who gathers all things mortal 
         With cold immortal hands; 
Her languid lips are sweeter 
Than love's who fears to greet her 
To men that mix and meet her 
         From many times and lands. 
 
She waits for each and other, 
         She waits for all men born; 
Forgets the earth her mother, 
            The life of fruits and corn; 
And spring and seed and swallow 
Take wing for her and follow 
Where summer song rings hollow 
         And flowers are put to scorn. 
 
There go the loves that wither, 
         The old loves with wearier wings; 
And all dead years draw thither, 
         And all disastrous things; 
Dead dreams of days forsaken, 
Blind buds that snows have shaken, 
Wild leaves that winds have taken, 
         Red strays of ruined springs. 
 
We are not sure of sorrow, 
         And joy was never sure; 
To-day will die to-morrow; 
         Time stoops to no man's lure; 
And love, grown faint and fretful, 
With lips but half regretful 
Sighs, and with eyes forgetful 
         Weeps that no loves endure. 
 
From too much love of living, 
         From hope and fear set free, 
We thank with brief thanksgiving 
         Whatever gods may be 
That no life lives for ever; 
That dead men rise up never; 
That even the weariest river 
         Winds somewhere safe to sea. 
 
Then star nor sun shall waken, 
         Nor any change of light: 
Nor sound of waters shaken, 
         Nor any sound or sight: 
Nor wintry leaves nor vernal,

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,In Memory of Walter Savage Landor,"Back to the flower-town, side by side, 
         The bright months bring, 
New-born, the bridegroom and the bride, 
         Freedom and spring. 
 
   The sweet land laughs from sea to sea, 
         Filled full of sun; 
All things come back to her, being free; 
         All things but one. 
 
   In many a tender wheaten plot 
         Flowers that were dead 
Live, and old suns revive; but not 
         That holier head. 
 
   By this white wandering waste of sea, 
         Far north, I hear 
One face shall never turn to me 
         As once this year: 
 
   Shall never smile and turn and rest 
         On mine as there, 
Nor one most sacred hand be prest 
         Upon my hair. 
 
   I came as one whose thoughts half linger, 
         Half run before; 
The youngest to the oldest singer 
         That England bore. 
 
   I found him whom I shall not find 
         Till all grief end, 
In holiest age our mightiest mind, 
         Father and friend. 
 
   But thou, if anything endure, 
         If hope there be, 
O spirit that man's life left pure, 
         Man's death set free, 
 
   Not with disdain of days that were 
         Look earthward now; 
Let dreams revive the reverend hair, 
         The imperial brow; 
 
   Come back in sleep, for in the life 
         Where thou art not 
We find none like thee. Time and strife 
         And the world's lot 
 
   Move thee no more; but love at least 
         And reverent heart 
May move thee, royal and released, 
         Soul, as thou art. 
 
   And thou, his Florence, to thy trust 
         Receive and keep, 
Keep safe his dedicated dust, 
         His sacred sleep.

         Mix with thy name 
As morning-star with evening-star

Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,Ave Atque Vale,"In Memory of Charles Baudelaire 
 
Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs; 
Les morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleurs, 
Et quand Octobre souffle, émondeur des vieux arbres, 
Son vent mélancolique à l'entour de leurs marbres, 
Certe, ils doivent trouver les vivants bien ingrats. 
 
Les Fleurs du Mal. 


I 
Shall I strew on thee rose or rue or laurel, 
      Brother, on this that was the veil of thee? 
      Or quiet sea-flower moulded by the sea, 
Or simplest growth of meadow-sweet or sorrel, 
      Such as the summer-sleepy Dryads weave, 
      Waked up by snow-soft sudden rains at eve? 
Or wilt thou rather, as on earth before, 
      Half-faded fiery blossoms, pale with heat 
      And full of bitter summer, but more sweet 
To thee than gleanings of a northern shore 
      Trod by no tropic feet? 
 
                            II 
For always thee the fervid languid glories 
      Allured of heavier suns in mightier skies; 
      Thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs 
Where the sea sobs round Lesbian promontories, 
      The barren kiss of piteous wave to wave 
      That knows not where is that Leucadian grave 
Which hides too deep the supreme head of song. 
      Ah, salt and sterile as her kisses were, 
      The wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear 
Hither and thither, and vex and work her wrong, 
      Blind gods that cannot spare. 
 
                            III 
Thou sawest, in thine old singing season, brother, 
      Secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us: 
      Fierce loves, and lovely leaf-buds poisonous, 
Bare to thy subtler eye, but for none other 
      Blowing by night in some unbreathed-in clime; 
      The hidden harvest of luxurious time, 
Sin without shape, and pleasure without speech; 
      And where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep 
      Make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep; 
And with each face thou sawest the shadow on each, 
      Seeing as men sow men reap. 
 
                            IV 
O sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping, 
      That were athirst for sleep and no more life 
      And no more love, for peace and no more strife! 
Now the dim gods of death have in their keeping 
      Spirit and body and all the springs of song, 
      Is it well now where love can do no wrong, 
Where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang 
      Behind the unopening closure of her lips? 
      Is it not well where soul from body slips 
And flesh from bone divides without a pang 
      As dew from flower-bell drips? 
 
                              V 
It is enough; the end and the beginning 
      Are one thing to thee, who art past the end. 
      O hand unclasped of unbeholden friend, 
For thee no fruits to pluck, no palms for winning, 
      No triumph and no labour and no lust, 
      Only dead yew-leaves and a little dust. 
O quiet eyes wherein the light saith nought, 
      Whereto the day is dumb, nor any night 
      With obscure finger silences your sight, 
Nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought, 
      Sleep, and have sleep for light. 
 
                            VI 
Now all strange hours and all strange loves are over, 
      Dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet, 
      Hast thou found place at the great knees and feet 
Of some pale Titan-woman like a lover, 
      Such as thy vision here solicited, 
      Under the shadow of her fair vast head, 
The deep division of prodigious breasts, 
      The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep, 
      The weight of awful tresses that still keep 
The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests 
      Where the wet hill-winds weep? 
 
                            VII 
Hast thou found any likeness for thy vision? 
      O gardener of strange flowers, what bud, what bloom, 
      Hast thou found sown, what gathered in the gloom? 
What of despair, of rapture, of derision, 
      What of life is there, what of ill or good? 
      Are the fruits grey like dust or bright like blood? 
Does the dim ground grow any seed of ours, 
      The faint fields quicken any terrene root, 
      In low lands where the sun and moon are mute 
And all the stars keep silence? Are there flowers 
      At all, or any fruit? 
 
                           VIII 
Alas, but though my flying song flies after, 
      O sweet strange elder singer, thy more fleet 
      Singing, and footprints of thy fleeter feet, 
Some dim derision of mysterious laughter 
      From the blind tongueless warders of the dead, 
      Some gainless glimpse of Proserpine's veiled head, 
Some little sound of unregarded tears 
      Wept by effaced unprofitable eyes, 
      And from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs — 
These only, these the hearkening spirit hears, 
      Sees only such things rise. 
 
                            IX 
Thou art far too far for wings of words to follow, 
      Far too far off for thought or any prayer. 
      What ails us with thee, who art wind and air? 
What ails us gazing where all seen is hollow? 
      Yet with some fancy, yet with some desire, 
      Dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire, 
Our dreams pursue our dead and do not find. 
      Still, and more swift than they, the thin flame flies, 
      The low light fails us in elusive skies, 
Still the foiled earnest ear is deaf, and blind 
      Are still the eluded eyes. 
 
                              X 
Not thee, O never thee, in all time's changes, 
      Not thee, but this the sound of thy sad soul, 
      The shadow of thy swift spirit, this shut scroll 
I lay my hand on, and not death estranges 
      My spirit from communion of thy song — 
      These memories and these melodies that throng 
Veiled porches of a Muse funereal — 
      These I salute, these touch, these clasp and fold 
      As though a hand were in my hand to hold, 
Or through mine ears a mourning musical 
      Of many mourners rolled. 
 
                            XI 
I among these, I also, in such station 
      As when the pyre was charred, and piled the sods, 
      And offering to the dead made, and their gods, 
The old mourners had, standing to make libation, 
      I stand, and to the gods and to the dead 
      Do reverence without prayer or praise, and shed 
Offering to these unknown, the gods of gloom, 
      And what of honey and spice my seedlands bear, 
      And what I may of fruits in this chilled air, 
And lay, Orestes-like, across the tomb 
      A curl of severed hair. 
 
                            XII 
But by no hand nor any treason stricken, 
      Not like the low-lying head of Him, the King, 
      The flame that made of Troy a ruinous thing, 
Thou liest, and on this dust no tears could quicken 
      There fall no tears like theirs that all men hear 
      Fall tear by sweet imperishable tear 
Down the opening leaves of holy poets' pages. 
      Thee not Orestes, not Electra mourns; 
      But bending us-ward with memorial urns 
The most high Muses that fulfil all ages 
      Weep, and our God's heart yearns. 
 
                           XIII 
For, sparing of his sacred strength, not often 
      Among us darkling here the lord of light 
      Makes manifest his music and his might 
In hearts that open and in lips that soften 
      With the soft flame and heat of songs that shine. 
      Thy lips indeed he touched with bitter wine, 
And nourished them indeed with bitter bread; 
      Yet surely from his hand thy soul's food came, 
      The fire that scarred thy spirit at his flame 
Was lighted, and thine hungering heart he fed 
      Who feeds our hearts with fame. 
 
                            XIV 
Therefore he too now at thy soul's sunsetting, 
      God of all suns and songs, he too bends down 
      To mix his laurel with thy cypress crown, 
And save thy dust from blame and from forgetting. 
      Therefore he too, seeing all thou wert and art, 
      Compassionate, with sad and sacred heart, 
Mourns thee of many his children the last dead, 
      And hallows with strange tears and alien sighs 
      Thine unmelodious mouth and sunless eyes, 
And over thine irrevocable head 
      Sheds light from the under skies. 
 
                            XV 
And one weeps with him in the ways Lethean, 
      And stains with tears her changing bosom chill: 
      That obscure Venus of the hollow hill, 
That thing transformed which was the Cytherean, 
      With lips that lost their Grecian laugh divine 
      Long since, and face no more called Erycine; 
A ghost, a bitter and luxurious god. 
      Thee also with fair flesh and singing spell 
      Did she, a sad and second prey, compel 
Into the footless places once more trod, 
      And shadows hot from hell. 
 
                            XVI 
And now no sacred staff shall break in blossom, 
      No choral salutation lure to light 
      A spirit sick with perfume and sweet night 
And love's tired eyes and hands and barren bosom. 
      There is no help for these things; none to mend 
      And none to mar; not all our songs, O friend, 
Will make death clear or make life durable. 
      Howbeit with rose and ivy and wild vine 
      And with wild notes about this dust of thine 
At least I fill the place where white dreams dwell 
      And wreathe an unseen shrine. 
 
                           XVII 
Sleep; and if life was bitter to thee, pardon, 
      If sweet, give thanks; thou hast no more to live; 
      And to give thanks is good, and to forgive. 
Out of the mystic and the mournful garden 
      Where all day through thine hands in barren braid 
      Wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade, 
Green buds of sorrow and sin, and remnants grey, 
      Sweet-smelling, pale with poison, sanguine-hearted, 
      Passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that started, 
Shall death not bring us all as thee one day 
      Among the days departed? 
 
                           XVIII 
For thee, O now a silent soul, my brother, 
      Take at my hands this garland, and farewell. 
      Thin is the leaf, and chill the wintry smell, 
And chill the solemn earth, a fatal mother, 
      With sadder than the Niobean womb, 
      And in the hollow of her breasts a tomb. 
Content thee, howsoe'er, whose days are done; 
      There lies not any troublous thing before, 
      Nor sight nor sound to war against thee more, 
For whom all winds are quiet as the sun, 
      All waters as the shore.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45275/ave-atque-vale-56d224b50fa53,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Algernon Charles Swinburne,1837–1909,A Sequence of Sonnets on the Death of Robert Browning,"I 
The clearest eyes in all the world they read 
       With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true 
       Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew 
Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, 
As they the light of ages quick and dead, 
       Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew 
       Can slay not one of all the works we knew, 
Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. 
 
The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, 
And moulded of unconquerable thought, 
       And quickened with imperishable flame, 
Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought 
       May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame, 
       Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name. 
 
II 
Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom 
       Time is not lord, but servant? What least part 
       Of all the fire that fed his living heart, 
Of all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom 
That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom 
       And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart 
       Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, 
A shadow born of terror's barren womb, 
That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, 
To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow, 
       That power on him is given thee,—that thy breath 
Can make him less than love acclaims him now, 
       And hears all time sound back the word it saith? 
       What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? 
 
III 
A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve: 
       Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand, 
       Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand 
And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. 
A graceless guerdon we that loved receive 
       For all our love, from that the dearest land 
       Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, 
Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, 
Shone on our dreams and memories evermore 
The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore 
       That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black 
Seems now the face we loved as he of yore. 
       We have given thee love—no stint, no stay, no lack: 
       What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? 
 
IV 
But he—to him, who knows what gift is thine, 
       Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we 
       Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, 
Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine 
And darken round such dreams as half divine 
       Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea 
       Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, 
To read with him the secret of thy shrine. 
 
There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, 
The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove, 
       Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky 
Till all beneath wax bright as all above: 
       But none of all that search the heavens, and try 
       The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye. 
 
V 
Among the wondrous ways of men and time 
       He went as one that ever found and sought 
       And bore in hand the lamp-like spirit of thought 
To illume with instance of its fire sublime 
The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime. 
       No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought, 
       No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought 
That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, 
No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, 
No love more lovely than the snows are white, 
       No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, 
No song-bird singing from some live soul's height, 
       But he might hear, interpret, or illume 
       With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. 
 
VI 
What secret thing of splendour or of shade 
       Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein 
       Man, led of love and life and death and sin, 
Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, 
Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade 
       Of that full soul that had for aim to win 
       Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, 
Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? 
O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee 
That he might know not of in spirit, and see 
       The heart within the heart that seems to strive, 
The life within the life that seems to be, 
       And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive, 
       The living sound of all men's souls alive? 
 
VII 
He held no dream worth waking: so he said, 
       He who stands now on death's triumphal steep, 
       Awakened out of life wherein we sleep 
And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. 
But never death for him was dark or dread: 
       ""Look forth"" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep, 
       All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep 
Vain memory's vision of a vanished head 
As all that lives of all that once was he 
Save that which lightens from his word: but we, 
       Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, 
Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea, 
       Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole, 
       And life and death but shadows of the soul.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Poetry & Poets', 'Elegy', 'Sonnet']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45303/a-sequence-of-sonnets-on-the-death-of-robert-browning,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/algernon-charles-swinburne,,1837.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

From up the sky, and laugh: ""Thou suffering thing,
Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,
that thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!""

Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die,
Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;
Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I
Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.

But not so.  How arrives it joy lies slain,

'Ich woll', 'Er sholl', and by-talk similar, 
Nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird 
At England's very loins, thereunto spurred 
By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are.

At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame

Thomas Hardy,1840–1928,No Buyers,"A Load of brushes and baskets and cradles and chairs
       Labours along the street in the rain:
With it a man, a woman, a pony with whiteybrown hairs. —
   The man foots in front of the horse with a shambling sway
       At a slower tread than a funeral train,
   While to a dirge-like tune he chants his wares,
Swinging a Turk's-head brush (in a drum-major's way
           When the bandsmen march and play).

A yard from the back of the man is the whiteybrown pony's nose:
He mirrors his master in every item of pace and pose:
       He stops when the man stops, without being told,
   And seems to be eased by a pause; too plainly he's old,
           Indeed, not strength enough shows
       To steer the disjointed waggon straight,
   Which wriggles left and right in a rambling line,
   Deflected thus by its own warp and weight,
   And pushing the pony with it in each incline.

       The woman walks on the pavement verge,
           Parallel to the man:
   She wears an apron white and wide in span,
And carries a like Turk's-head, but more in nursing-wise:
   Now and then she joins in his dirge,
   But as if her thoughts were on distant things,
   The rain clams her apron till it clings. —

Thomas Hardy,1840–1928,The Darkling Thrush,"I leant upon a coppice gate
      When Frost was spectre-grey,
And Winter's dregs made desolate
      The weakening eye of day.
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
      Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
      Had sought their household fires.

The land's sharp features seemed to be
      The Century's corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,
      The wind his death-lament.

And Winter's dregs made desolate

The tangled bine-stems scored the sky

Stéphane Mallarmé,1842–1898,The Pipe,"Yesterday I found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but I was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, I breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me. I had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to France, and now all of London, London as I had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements. My tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! Once again I saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—I saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller’s clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever.",prose poem,types/modes,"['Love', 'Break-ups & Vexed Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Activities', 'Indoor Activities', 'Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Men & Women', 'Prose Poem', 'Symbolist']","Stéphane Mallarmé, ""The Pipe"" from Collected Poems.

If bent in prayer to three or four.

Take not the Name in vain. Direct
Thy swearing unto some effect.

Work not at all unless compelled.

Honor thy parents, and perchance
Their wills thy fortunes may advance.

Kill not—death liberates thy foe
From persecution’s constant woe.

Kiss not thy neighbor’s wife. Of course
There’s no objection to divorce.

In cheating there is greater gain.

And say that you have “heard it said.”

Gerard Manley Hopkins,1844 – 1889,The Sea and the Skylark,"On ear and ear two noises too old to end
     Trench—right, the tide that ramps against the shore;
     With a flood or a fall, low lull-off or all roar,
Frequenting there while moon shall wear and wend.

Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,
     His rash-fresh re-winded new-skeinèd score
     In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour
And pelt music, till none’s to spill nor spend.

How these two shame this shallow and frail town!
     How ring right out our sordid turbid time,
Being pure! We, life’s pride and cared-for crown,

     Have lost that cheer and charm of earth’s past prime:
Our make and making break, are breaking, down

   It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
   And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
   And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;
   There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
And though the last lights off the black West went
   Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--

As tumbled over rim in roundy wells 
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's

Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;

Crying Whát I dó is me: for that I came.

Keeps grace: thát keeps all his goings graces;

Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his

Gerard Manley Hopkins,1844–1889,Spring,"Nothing is so beautiful as Spring –          
   When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;          
   Thrush’s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush          
Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring          
The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing; 
   The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush          
   The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush          
With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.          
 
What is all this juice and all this joy?          
   A strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning 
In Eden garden. – Have, get, before it cloy,

From where I dwell—upon the hither side? 
Thou little veil for so great mystery, 
When shall I penetrate all things and thee, 
And then look back? For this I must abide, 

Till thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled

                                           I.

As the blind Milton’s memory of light,
The deaf Beethoven’s phantasy of tone,
Wrought joys for them surpassing all things known
In our restricted sphere of sound and sight,—
So while the glaring streets of brick and stone
Vex with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,
I will give rein to Fancy, taking flight
From dismal now and here, and dwell alone
With new-enfranchised senses. All day long,
Think ye ’t is I, who sit ’twixt darkened walls,
While ye chase beauty over land and sea?
Uplift on wings of some rare poet’s song,
Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,
I soar cloud-high, free as the winds are free.

                                           II.

Who grasps the substance? who ’mid shadows strays?
He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,
’Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pines
Have cushioned all his couch with soft brown sprays?
He notes not how the living water shines,
Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,
Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gaze
To read the ancient wonders and the signs.
Does he possess the actual, or do I,
Who paint on air more than his sense receives,
The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,
Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the sky
Quiver like azure flame between the leaves,
And open unseen gates with key of gold?

Emma Lazarus,1849 – 1887,Chopin,"I

A dream of interlinking hands, of feet 
Tireless to spin the unseen, fairy woof 
Of the entangling waltz. Bright eyebeams meet, 
Gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof. 
Warm perfumes rise; the soft unflickering glow 
Of branching lights sets off the changeful charms 
Of glancing gems, rich stuffs, the dazzling snow 
Of necks unkerchieft, and bare, clinging arms. 
Hark to the music! How beneath the strain 
Of reckless revelry, vibrates and sobs 
One fundamental chord of constant pain, 
The pulse-beat of the poet's heart that throbs. 
So yearns, though all the dancing waves rejoice, 
The troubled sea's disconsolate, deep voice. 

 

II

Who shall proclaim the golden fable false 
Of Orpheus' miracles? This subtle strain 
Above our prose-world's sordid loss and gain 
Lightly uplifts us. With the rhythmic waltz, 
The lyric prelude, the nocturnal song 
Of love and languor, varied visions rise, 
That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes. 
The Polish poet who sleeps silenced long, 
The seraph-souled musician, breathes again 
Eternal eloquence, immortal pain. 
Revived the exalted face we know so well, 
The illuminated eyes, the fragile frame, 
Slowly consuming with its inward flame, 
We stir not, speak not, lest we break the spell. 

 

III

A voice was needed, sweet and true and fine 
As the sad spirit of the evening breeze, 
Throbbing with human passion, yet devine 
As the wild bird's untutored melodies. 
A voice for him 'neath twilight heavens dim, 
Who mourneth for his dead, while round him fall 
The wan and noiseless leaves. A voice for him 
Who sees the first green sprout, who hears the call 
Of the first robin on the first spring day. 
A voice for all whom Fate hath set apart, 
Who, still misprized, must perish by the way, 
Longing with love, for that they lack the art 
Of their own soul's expression. For all these 
Sing the unspoken hope, the vague, sad reveries. 

 

IV

Then Nature shaped a poet's heart--a lyre 
From out whose chords the lightest breeze that blows 
Drew trembling music, wakening sweet desire. 
How shall she cherish him? Behold! she throws 
This precious, fragile treasure in the whirl 
Of seething passions; he is scourged and stung, 
Must dive in storm-vext seas, if but one pearl 
Of art or beauty therefrom may be wrung. 
No pure-browed pensive nymph his Muse shall be, 
An amazon of thought with sovereign eyes, 
Whose kiss was poison, man-brained, worldy-wise, 
Inspired that elfin, delicate harmony. 
Rich gain for us! But with him is it well?

Emma Lazarus,1849–1887,By the Waters of Babylon,"Little Poems in Prose

I. The Exodus. (August 3, 1492.)

1. The Spanish noon is a blaze of azure fire, and the dusty pilgrims crawl like an endless serpent along treeless plains and bleached highroads, through rock-split ravines and castellated, cathedral-shadowed towns.

2. The hoary patriarch, wrinkled as an almond shell, bows painfully upon his staff. The beautiful young mother, ivory-pale, well-nigh swoons beneath her burden; in her large enfolding arms nestles her sleeping babe, round her knees flock her little ones with bruised and bleeding feet. “Mother, shall we soon be there?”

3. The youth with Christ-like countenance speaks comfortably to father and brother, to maiden and wife. In his breast, his own heart is broken.

4. The halt, the blind, are amid the train. Sturdy pack-horses laboriously drag the tented wagons wherein lie the sick athirst with fever.

5. The panting mules are urged forward with spur and goad; stuffed are the heavy saddlebags with the wreckage of ruined homes.

6. Hark to the tinkling silver bells that adorn the tenderly-carried silken scrolls.

7. In the fierce noon-glare a lad bears a kindled lamp; behind its network of bronze the airs of heaven breathe not upon its faint purple star.

8. Noble and abject, learned and simple, illustrious and obscure, plod side by side, all brothers now, all merged in one routed army of misfortune.

9. Woe to the straggler who falls by the wayside! no friend shall close his eyes.

10. They leave behind, the grape, the olive, and the fig; the vines they planted, the corn they sowed, the garden-cities of Andalusia and Aragon, Estremadura and La Mancha, of Granada and Castile; the altar, the hearth, and the grave of their fathers.

11. The townsman spits at their garments, the shepherd quits his flock, the peasant his plow, to pelt with curses and stones; the villager sets on their trail his yelping cur.

12. Oh the weary march, oh the uptorn roots of home, oh the blankness of the receding goal!

13. Listen to their lamentation: They that ate dainty food are desolate in the streets; they that were reared in scarlet embrace dunghills. They flee away and wander about. Men say among the nations, they shall no more sojourn there; our end is near, our days are full, our doom is come.

14. Whither shall they turn? for the West hath cast them out, and the East refuseth to receive.

15. O bird of the air, whisper to the despairing exiles, that to-day, to-day, from the many-masted, gayly-bannered port of Palos, sails the world-unveiling Genoese, to unlock the golden gates of sunset and bequeath a Continent to Freedom!


II. Treasures.

1. Through cycles of darkness the diamond sleeps in its coal-black prison.

2. Purely incrusted in its scaly casket, the breath-tarnished pearl slumbers in mud and ooze.

3. Buried in the bowels of earth, rugged and obscure, lies the ingot of gold.

4. Long hast thou been buried, O Israel, in the bowels of earth; long hast thou slumbered beneath the overwhelming waves; long hast thou slept in the rayless house of darkness.

5. Rejoice and sing, for only thus couldst thou rightly guard the golden knowledge, Truth, the delicate pearl and the adamantine jewel of the Law.


III. The Sower.

1. Over a boundless plain went a man, carrying seed.

2. His face was blackened by sun and rugged from tempest, scarred and distorted by pain. Naked to the loins, his back was ridged with furrows, his breast was plowed with stripes.

3. From his hand dropped the fecund seed.

4. And behold, instantly started from the prepared soil blade, a sheaf, a springing trunk, a myriad-branching, cloud-aspiring tree. Its arms touched the ends of the horizon, the heavens were darkened with its shadow.

5. It bare blossoms of gold and blossoms of blood, fruitage of health and fruitage of poison; birds sang amid its foliage, and a serpent was coiled about its stem.

6. Under its branches a divinely beautiful man, crowned with thorns, was nailed to a cross.

7. And the tree put forth treacherous boughs to strangle the Sower; his flesh was bruised and torn, but cunningly he disentangled the murderous knot and passed to the eastward.

8. Again there dropped from his hand the fecund seed.

9. And behold, instantly started from the prepared soil a blade, a sheaf, a springing trunk, a myriad-branching, cloud-aspiring tree. Crescent shaped like little emerald moons were the leaves; it bare blossoms of silver and blossoms of blood, fruitage of health and fruitage of poison; birds sang amid its foilage and a serpent was coiled about its stem.

10. Under its branches a turbaned mighty-limbed Prophet brandished a drawn sword.

11. And behold, this tree likewise puts forth perfidious arms to strangle the Sower; but cunningly he disentangles the murderous knot and passes on.

12. Lo, his hands are not empty of grain, the strength of his arm is not spent.

13. What germ hast thou saved for the future, O miraculous Husbandman? Tell me, thou Planter of Christhood and Islam; tell me, thou seed-bearing Israel!


IV. The Test.

1. Daylong I brooded upon the Passion of Israel.

2. I saw him bound to the wheel, nailed to the cross, cut off by the sword, burned at the stake, tossed into the seas.

3. And always the patient, resolute, martyr face arose in silent rebuke and defiance.

4. A Prophet with four eyes; wide gazed the orbs of the spirit above the sleeping eyelids of the senses.

5. A Poet, who plucked from his bosom the quivering heart and fashioned it into a lyre.

6. A placid-browed Sage, uplifted from earth in celestial meditation.

7. These I saw, with princes and people in their train; the monumental dead and the standard-bearers of the future.

8. And suddenly I heard a burst of mocking laughter, and turning, I beheld the shuffling gait, the ignominious features, the sordid mask of the son of the Ghetto.


V. Currents.

1. Vast oceanic movements, the flux and reflux of immeasurable tides, oversweep our continent.

2. From the far Caucasian steppes, from the squalid Ghettos of Europe,

3. From Odessa and Bucharest, from Kief and Ekaterinoslav,

4. Hark to the cry of the exiles of Babylon, the voice of Rachel mourning for her children, of Israel lamenting for Zion.

5. And lo, like a turbid stream, the long-pent flood bursts the dykes of oppression and rushes hitherward.

6. Unto her ample breast, the generous mother of nations welcomes them.

7. The herdsman of Canaan and the seed of Jerusalem’s royal shepherds renew their youth amid the pastoral plains of Texas and the golden valleys of the Sierras.


VI. The Prophet.

1. Moses ben Maimon lifting his perpetual lamp over the path of the perplexed;

2. Hallevi, the honey-tongued poet, wakening amid the silent ruins of Zion the sleeping lyre of David;

3. Moses, the wise son of Mendel, who made the Ghetto illustrious;

4. Abarbanel, the counselor of kings; Aicharisi, the exquisite singer; Ibn Ezra, the perfect old man; Gabirol, the tragic seer;

5. Heine, the enchanted magician, the heart-broken jester;

6.Yea, and the century-crowned patriarch whose bounty engirdles the globe;—

7. These need no wreath and no trumpet; like perennial asphodel blossoms, their fame, their glory resounds like the brazen-throated cornet.

8. But thou—hast thou faith in the fortune of Israel? Wouldst thou lighten the anguish of Jacob?

9. Then shalt thou take the hand of yonder caftaned wretch with flowing curls and gold-pierced ears;

10. Who crawls blinking forth from the loathsome recesses of the Jewry;

11. Nerveless his fingers, puny his frame; haunted by the bat-like phantoms of superstition is his brain.

12. Thou shalt say to the bigot, “My Brother,” and to the creature of darkness, “My Friend.”

13 . And thy heart shall spend itself in fountains of love upon the ignorant, the coarse, and the abject.

14. Then in the obscurity thou shalt hear a rush of wings, thine eyes shall be bitten with pungent smoke.

15. And close against thy quivering lips shall be pressed the live coal wherewith the Seraphim brand the Prophets.


VII. Chrysalis.

1. Long, long has the Orient Jew spun around his helplessness the cunningly enmeshed web of Talmud and Kabbala.

2. Imprisoned in dark corners of misery and oppression, closely he drew about him the dust-gray filaments, soft as silk and stubborn as steel, until he lay death-stiffened in mummied seclusion.

3. And the world has named him an ugly worm, shunning the blessed daylight.

4. But when the emancipating springtide breathes wholesome, quickening airs, when the Sun of Love shines out with cordial fires, lo, the Soul of Israel bursts her cobweb sheath, and flies forth attired in the winged beauty of immortality.",prose poem,types/modes,"['Travels & Journeys', 'Relationships', 'Family & Ancestors', 'Religion', 'Judaism', 'Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Prose Poem']","Source:

For May is here once more, and so is he,—
His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee,
And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they:
Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array
Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me
Of woody pathways winding endlessly
Along the creek, where even yesterday
He plunged his shrinking body—gasped and shook—
Yet called the water ""warm,"" with never lack
Of joy. And so, half enviously I look
Upon this graceless barefoot and his track,—
His toe stubbed—ay, his big toe-nail knocked back

Looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep, 
And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below 
Sounded like the laugh of something we onc't ust to know 
Before we could remember anything but the eyes 
Of the angels lookin' out as we left Paradise; 
But the merry days of youth is beyond our controle, 
And it's hard to part ferever with the old swimmin'-hole. 
 
Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the happy days of yore, 
When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore, 
Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide 
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified, 
It made me love myself, as I leaped to caress 
My shadder smilin' up at me with sich tenderness. 
But them days is past and gone, and old Time's tuck his toll 
From the old man come back to the old swimmin'-hole. 
 
Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the long, lazy days 
When the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways, 
How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane, 
Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane 
You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole 
They was lots o' fun on hands at the old swimmin'-hole. 
But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow roll 
Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin'-hole. 
 
Thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so tall, 
And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all; 
And it mottled the worter with amber and gold 
Tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled; 
And the snake-feeder's four gauzy wings fluttered by 
Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky, 
Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze's controle 
As it cut acrost some orchard to'rds the old swimmin'-hole. 
 
Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! When I last saw the place, 
The scenes was all changed, like the change in my face; 
The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot 
Whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot. 
And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be— 
But never again will theyr shade shelter me!

With none to tell me what to do —

Till morning in the land of Nod.

Ella Wheeler Wilcox,1850–1919,War Mothers,"There is something in the sound of drum and fife
 That stirs all the savage instincts into life.
  
 In the old times of peace we went our ways,
 Through proper days
 Of little joys and tasks. Lonely at times,
 When from the steeple sounded wedding chimes,
 Telling to all the world some maid was wife—
 But taking patiently our part in life
 As it was portioned us by Church and State,
 Believing it our fate.
     Our thoughts all chaste
 Held yet a secret wish to love and mate
     Ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste.
 But men we criticised for lack of strength,
 And kept them at arm's length.
 Then the war came—
 The world was all aflame!
 The men we had thought dull and void of power
 Were heroes in an hour.
 He who had seemed a slave to petty greed
 Showed masterful in that great time of need.
 He who had plotted for his neighbour's pelf,
 Now for his fellows offers up himself.
 And we were only women, forced by war
 To sacrifice the things worth living for.
  
 Something within us broke,
    Something within us woke,
        The wild cave-woman spoke.
  
 When we heard the sound of drumming,
    As our soldiers went to camp,
    Heard them tramp, tramp, tramp;
 As we watched to see them coming,
    And they looked at us and smiled
    (Yes, looked back at us and smiled),
 As they filed along by hillock and by hollow,
    Then our hearts were so beguiled
    That, for many and many a day,
    We dreamed we heard them say,
 'Oh, follow, follow, follow!'
    And the distant, rolling drum
    Called us 'Come, come, come!'
    Till our virtue seemed a thing to give away.
  
 War had swept ten thousand years away from earth.
    We were primal once again.
    There were males, not modern men;
 We were females meant to bring their sons to birth.
    And we could not wait for any formal rite,
    We could hear them calling to us, 'Come to-night;
 For to-morrow, at the dawn,
 We move on!'
    And the drum
    Bellowed, 'Come, come, come!'
 And the fife
 Whistled, 'Life, life, life!'
  
 So they moved on and fought and bled and died;
 Honoured and mourned, they are the nation's pride.
 We fought our battles, too, but with the tide
 Of our red blood, we gave the world new lives.
 Because we were not wives
 We are dishonoured. Is it noble, then,
 To break God's laws only by killing men
 To save one's country from destruction?
 We took no man's life but gave our chastity,
 And sinned the ancient sin
 To plant young trees and fill felled forests in.
  
 Oh, clergy of the land,
 Bible in hand,
 All reverently you stand,
    On holy thoughts intent
    While barren wives receive the sacrament!
 Had you the open visions you could see
    Phantoms of infants murdered in the womb,
    Who never knew a cradle or a tomb,
 Hovering about these wives accusingly.
  
 Bestow the sacrament! Their sins are not well known—
 Ours to the four winds of the earth are blown.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Living', 'Death', 'Parenthood', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Couplet']","Source:

      The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back, 
And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and gay 
      As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its way, 
And a shadow seemed drawn o’er the sun’s golden track. 
 
Somebody’s baby was laid out to rest, 
      White as a snowdrop, and fair to behold, 
And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast, 
      And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed 
With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold. 
 
Somebody saw it go out of her sight, 
      Under the coffin lid—out through the door; 
Somebody finds only darkness and blight 
      All through the glory of summer-sun light; 
Somebody’s baby will waken no more. 
 
Somebody’s sorrow is making me weep: 
      I know not her name, but I echo her cry, 
For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep, 
      The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep 
In the little white hearse that went rumbling by. 
 
I know not her name, but her sorrow I know; 
      While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more, 
And back to my heart surged that river of woe 
      That but in the breast of a mother can flow; 
For the little white hearse has been, too, at my door.",elegy,types/modes,"['Living', 'Death', 'Infancy', 'Sorrow & Grieving', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45938/the-little-white-hearse,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/ella-wheeler-wilcox,,1850.0,1919.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Edwin Markham,1852 – 1940,The Man with the Hoe,"Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans
Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,
The emptiness of ages in his face,
And on his back the burden of the world.
Who made him dead to rapture and despair,
A thing that grieves not and that never hopes. 
Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?
Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?
Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow? 
Whose breath blew out the light within this brain? 
Is this the Thing the Lord God made and gave
To have dominion over sea and land;
To trace the stars and search the heavens for power;
To feel the passion of Eternity?
Is this the Dream He dreamed who shaped the suns 
And marked their ways upon the ancient deep?
Down all the stretch of Hell to its last gulf 
There is no shape more terrible than this — 
More tongued with censure of the world's blind greed — 
More filled with signs and portents for the soul — 
More fraught with menace to the universe.
What gulfs between him and the seraphim! 
Slave of the wheel of labor, what to him 
Are Plato and the swing of Pleiades? 
What the long reaches of the peaks of song,
The rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose? 
Through this dread shape the suffering ages look;
Time's tragedy is in the aching stoop;
Through this dread shape humanity betrayed,
Plundered, profaned, and disinherited, 
Cries protest to the Powers that made the world.
A protest that is also a prophecy.
O masters, lords and rulers in all lands, 
Is this the handiwork you give to God,
This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?
How will you ever straighten up this shape; 
Touch it again with immortality;
Give back the upward looking and the light;
Rebuild in it the music and the dream,
Make right the immemorial infamies,
Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes? 
O masters, lords and rulers in all lands
How will the Future reckon with this Man? 
How answer his brute question in that hour
When whirlwinds of rebellion shake all shores?
How will it be with kingdoms and with kings — 
With those who shaped him to the thing he is — 
When this dumb Terror shall rise to judge the world.

Henrietta Cordelia Ray,1852–1916,Self-Mastery,"To catch the spirit in its wayward flight 
Through mazes manifold, what task supreme! 
For when to floods has grown the quiet stream, 
Much human skill must aid its rage to fight; 
And when wild winds invade the solemn night, 
Seems not man’s vaunted power but a dream? 
And still more futile, ay, we e’en must deem 
This quest to tame the soul, and guide aright 
Its restless wanderings, – to lure it back 
To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh 
Attend the strife; till, effort merged in prayer, 
Oft uttered, clung to – when of strength the lack 
Seems direst – brings the answer to our cry: 
A gift from Him who lifts our ev’ry care.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Living', 'Sonnet']","Source:

Henrietta Cordelia Ray,1852–1916,An Ocean Musing,"Far, far out lie the white sails all at rest; 
Like spectral arms they seem to touch and cling 
Unto the wide horizon. Not a wing 
Of truant bird glides down the purpling west; 
No breeze dares to intrude, e’en on a quest 
To fan a lover’s brow; the waves to sing 
Have quite forgotten till the deep shall fling 
A bow across its vibrant chords. Then, lest 
One moment of the sea’s repose we lose,

Henrietta Cordelia Ray,1852–1916,Lincoln,"To-day, O martyred chief, beneath the sun
 We would unveil thy form; to thee who won
 Th’applause of nations for thy soul sincere,
 A loving tribute we would offer here.
 ’T was thine not worlds to conquer, but men’s hearts;
 To change to balm the sting of slavery’s darts;
 In lowly charity thy joy to find,
 And open “gates of mercy on mankind.”
 And so they come, the freed, with grateful gift,
 From whose sad path the shadows thou didst lift.
  
 Eleven years have rolled their seasons round,
 Since its most tragic close thy life-work found.
 Yet through the vistas of the vanished days
 We see thee still, responsive to our gaze,
 As ever to thy country’s solemn needs.
 Not regal coronets, but princely deeds
 Were thy chaste diadem; of truer worth
 Thy modest virtues than the gems of earth.
 Stanch, honest, fervent in the purest cause,
 Truth was thy guide; her mandates were thy laws.
  
 Rare heroism, spirit-purity,
 The storied Spartan’s stern simplicity,
 Such moral strength as gleams like burnished gold
 Amid the doubt of men of weaker mould,
 Were thine. Called in thy country’s sorest hour,
 When brother knew not brother—mad for power—
 To guide the helm through bloody deeps of war,
 While distant nations gazed in anxious awe,
 Unflinching in the task, thou didst fulfill
 Thy mighty mission with a deathless will.
  
 Born to a destiny the most sublime,
 Thou wert, O Lincoln! in the march of time,
 God bade thee pause and bid the oppressed go free—
 Most glorious boon giv’n to humanity.
 While slavery ruled the land, what deeds were done?
 What tragedies enacted ’neath the sun!
 Her page is blurred with records of defeat,
 Of lives heroic lived in silence, meet
 For the world’s praise; of woe, despair and tears,
 The speechless agony of weary years.
  
 Thou utteredst the word, and Freedom fair
 Rang her sweet bells on the clear winter air;
 She waved her magic wand, and lo! from far
 A long procession came. With many a scar
 Their brows were wrinkled, in the bitter strife,
 Full many had said their sad farewell to life
 But on they hastened, free, their shackles gone;
 The aged, young,—e’en infancy was borne
 To offer unto thee loud paeans of praise,—
 Their happy tribute after saddest days.
  
 A race set free! The deed brought joy and light!
 It bade calm Justice from her sacred height,
 When faith and hope and courage slowly waned,
 Unfurl the stars and stripes, at last unstained!
 The nations rolled acclaim from sea to sea,
 And Heaven’s vault rang with Freedom’s harmony.
 The angels ’mid the amaranths must have hushed
 Their chanted cadences, as upward rushed
 The hymn sublime: and as the echoes pealed,
 God’s ceaseless benison the action sealed.
  
 As now we dedicate this shaft to thee,
 True champion! in all humility
 And solemn earnestness, we would erect
 A monument invisible, undecked,
 Save by our allied purpose to be true
 To Freedom’s loftiest precepts, so that through
 The fiercest contests we may walk secure,
 Fixed on foundations that may still endure,
 When granite shall have crumbled to decay,
 And generations passed from earth away.
  
 Exalted patriot! illustrious chief!
 Thy life’s immortal work compels belief.
 To-day in radiance thy virtues shine,
 And how can we a fitting garland twine?
 Thy crown most glorious to a ransomed race!
 High on our country’s scroll we fondly trace,
 In lines of fadeless light that softly blend,
 Emancipator, hero, martyr, friend!
 While Freedom may her holy sceptre claim,
 The world shall echo with Our Lincoln’s name.",elegy,types/modes,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Heroes & Patriotism', 'Elegy', 'Rhymed Stanza']","Source:

Arthur Rimbaud,1854 – 1891,From “A Season in Hell [Delirium I]”,"          “I was witness of all the adornments with which he surrounded himself in spirit; garments, cloths, furniture; I lent him weapons, a different face. I saw all that touched him, just as he would have liked to create it for himself. When his spirit seemed to me apathetic, I followed him far in strange and complicated actions, good or bad; I was certain never to enter his world. Beside his dear, sleeping body, what hours I have watched at night, seeking to learn why he was so anxious to escape from reality. Never was there a man with such a vow as that. I recognized,—without being afraid for him,—that he might be a serious danger to society.—Perhaps he possesses secrets that will change life. No, I replied to myself, he is only looking for them. Finally his kindness is enchanted, and I am its prisoner. No other soul would have the strength,—the strength of despair!—to endure it, to be loved and protected by him. Besides, I would not picture him to myself with another soul: one sees his Angel, never another’s Angel,—I believe. I used to exist in his soul as in a palace, which they have made empty in order not to see so mean a person as yourself: that was all. Alas! I was very dependent on him. But what did he want of my colourless and facile being? He would not improve me, unless he were to make me die. Sadly mortified, I sometimes would say to him:

           “‘I understand you.’ He would shrug his shoulders.

         “Thus, with my vexation renewing itself daily, finding myself more and more altered in my own eyes—as in all eyes which might have cared to look at me, had I not been condemned everlastingly to the oblivion of all men!—I grew hungrier and hungrier for his kindness. With kisses and friendly embraces, it was indeed a heaven, a gloomy heaven, which I entered, and where I should have wished to be left, poor, deaf, dumb, blind. Already I had the habit of it. I used to see us as good children, free to walk in the Paradise of sadness. We were in harmony with one another. Much affected, we would work together. But after a poignant caress, he would say: ‘How funny it will seem to you when I am no longer here, through whom you have passed. When you no longer have my arms under your neck, nor my heart to fall asleep on, nor this mouth upon your eyes. For I shall have to go away, very far, some day. Besides, I must help others; it is my duty. Although this may not be especially appetizing to you . . . dear friend.’ All at once I foresaw myself, with him gone, the prey of dizziness, plunged into the most frightful shadow: death. I used to make him promise that he would not abandon me. He gave it twenty times, that lover’s promise. It was as frivolous as my saying to him:

          “‘I understand you.’ 

 

 

 

          «Je voyais tout le décor dont, en esprit, il s’entourait; vêtements, draps, meubles: je lui prêtais des armes, une autre figure. Je voyais tout ce qui le touchait, comme il aurait voulu le créer pour lui. Quand il me semblait avoir l’esprit inerte, je le suivais, moi, dans des actions étranges et compliquées, loin, bonnes ou mauvaises: j’étais sûre de ne jamais entrer dans son monde. À côté de son cher corps endormi, que d’heures des nuits j’ai veillé, cherchant pourquoi il voulait tant s’évader de la réalité. Jamais homme n’eût pareil vœu. Je reconnaissais,—sans craindre pour lui,—qu’il pouvait être un sérieux danger dans la société.—Il a peut-être des secrets pour changer la vie? Non, il ne fait qu’en chercher, me répliquais-je. Enfin sa charité est ensorcelée, et j’en suis la prisonnière. Aucune autre âme n’aurait assez de force,—force de désespoir!—pour la supporter,—pour être protégée et aimée par lui. D’ailleurs, je ne me le figurais pas avec une autre âme: on voit son Ange, jamais l’Ange d’un autre,—je crois. J’étais dans son âme comme dans un palais qu’on a vidé pour ne pas voir une personne si peu noble que vous: voilà tout. Hélas! je dépendais bien de lui. Mais que voulait-il avec mon existence terne et lâche? Il ne me rendait pas meilleure, s’il ne me faisait pas mourir! Tristement dépitée, je lui dis quelquefois: «Je te comprends.» Il haussait les épaules.

          «Ainsi, mon chagrin se renouvelant sans cesse, et me trouvant plus égarée à mes yeux,—comme à tous les yeux qui auraient voulu me fixer, si je n’eusse été condamnée pour jamais à l’oubli de tous!—j’avais de plus en plus faim de sa bonté. Avec ses baisers et ses étreintes amies, c’était bien un ciel, un sombre ciel, où j’entrais, et où j’aurais voulu être laissée, pauvre, sourde, muette, aveugle. Déjà j’en prenais l’habitude. Je nous voyais comme deux bons enfants, libres de se promener dans le Paradis de tristesse. Nous nous accordions. Bien émus, nous travaillions ensemble. Mais, après une pénétrante caresse, il disait: «Comme ça te paraîtra drôle, quand je n’y serai plus, ce par quoi tu as passé. Quand tu n’auras plus mes bras sous ton cou, ni mon cœur pour t’y reposer, ni cette bouche sur tes yeux.

Oscar Wilde,1854 – 1900,The Ballad of Reading Gaol,"I

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
  For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
  When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
  And murdered in her bed.

He walked amongst the Trial Men
  In a suit of shabby grey;
A cricket cap was on his head,
  And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
  So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
  With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
  Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every drifting cloud that went
  With sails of silver by.

I walked, with other souls in pain,
  Within another ring,
And was wondering if the man had done
  A great or little thing,
When a voice behind me whispered low,
  ""That fellow's got to swing.""

Dear Christ! the very prison walls
  Suddenly seemed to reel,
And the sky above my head became
  Like a casque of scorching steel;
And, though I was a soul in pain,
  My pain I could not feel.

I only knew what hunted thought
  Quickened his step, and why
He looked upon the garish day
  With such a wistful eye;
The man had killed the thing he loved
  And so he had to die.

Yet each man kills the thing he loves
  By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
  Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
  The brave man with a sword!

Some kill their love when they are young,
  And some when they are old;
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,
  Some with the hands of Gold:
The kindest use a knife, because
  The dead so soon grow cold.

Some love too little, some too long,
  Some sell, and others buy;
Some do the deed with many tears,
  And some without a sigh:
For each man kills the thing he loves,
  Yet each man does not die.

He does not die a death of shame
  On a day of dark disgrace,
Nor have a noose about his neck,
  Nor a cloth upon his face,
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
  Into an empty place

He does not sit with silent men
  Who watch him night and day;
Who watch him when he tries to weep,
  And when he tries to pray;
Who watch him lest himself should rob
  The prison of its prey.

He does not wake at dawn to see
  Dread figures throng his room,
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,
  The Sheriff stern with gloom,
And the Governor all in shiny black,
  With the yellow face of Doom.

He does not rise in piteous haste
  To put on convict-clothes,
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes
  Each new and nerve-twitched pose,
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
  Are like horrible hammer-blows.

He does not know that sickening thirst
  That sands one's throat, before
The hangman with his gardener's gloves
  Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
  That the throat may thirst no more.

He does not bend his head to hear
  The Burial Office read,
Nor, while the terror of his soul
  Tells him he is not dead,
Cross his own coffin, as he moves
  Into the hideous shed.

He does not stare upon the air
  Through a little roof of glass;
He does not pray with lips of clay
  For his agony to pass;
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
  The kiss of Caiaphas.

II

Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,
  In a suit of shabby grey:
His cricket cap was on his head,
  And his step seemed light and gay,
But I never saw a man who looked
  So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
  With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
  Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
  Its raveled fleeces by.

He did not wring his hands, as do
  Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
  In the cave of black Despair:
He only looked upon the sun,
  And drank the morning air.

He did not wring his hands nor weep,
  Nor did he peek or pine,
But he drank the air as though it held
  Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
  As though it had been wine!

And I and all the souls in pain,
  Who tramped the other ring,
Forgot if we ourselves had done
  A great or little thing,
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
  The man who had to swing.

And strange it was to see him pass
  With a step so light and gay,
And strange it was to see him look
  So wistfully at the day,
And strange it was to think that he
  Had such a debt to pay.

For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
  That in the spring-time shoot:
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,
  With its adder-bitten root,
And, green or dry, a man must die
  Before it bears its fruit!

The loftiest place is that seat of grace
  For which all worldlings try:
But who would stand in hempen band
  Upon a scaffold high,
And through a murderer's collar take
  His last look at the sky?

It is sweet to dance to violins
  When Love and Life are fair:
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes
  Is delicate and rare:
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
  To dance upon the air!

So with curious eyes and sick surmise
  We watched him day by day,
And wondered if each one of us
  Would end the self",ballad,verse forms,"['Ballad', 'Heartache', 'Incarceration', 'Public Domain', 'Tragedy', 'Turmoil', 'Farewell']","This poem is in the public domain.

        So now is music prisoned in her cave,

Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman,1860–1935,To The Indifferent Women,"A Sestina

You who are happy in a thousand homes,
Or overworked therein, to a dumb peace;
Whose souls are wholly centered in the life
Of that small group you personally love;
Who told you that you need not know or care
About the sin and sorrow of the world?

Do you believe the sorrow of the world
Does not concern you in your little homes? —
That you are licensed to avoid the care
And toil for human progress, human peace,
And the enlargement of our power of love
Until it covers every field of life?

The one first duty of all human life
Is to promote the progress of the world
In righteousness, in wisdom, truth and love;
And you ignore it, hidden in your homes,
Content to keep them in uncertain peace,
Content to leave all else without your care.

Yet you are mothers! And a mother's care
Is the first step toward friendly human life.
Life where all nations in untroubled peace
Unite to raise the standard of the world
And make the happiness we seek in homes
Spread everywhere in strong and fruitful love.

You are content to keep that mighty love
In its first steps forever; the crude care
Of animals for mate and young and homes,
Instead of pouring it abroad in life,
Its mighty current feeding all the world
Till every human child can grow in peace.

You cannot keep your small domestic peace
Your little pool of undeveloped love,
While the neglected, starved, unmothered world
Struggles and fights for lack of mother's care,
And its tempestuous, bitter, broken life
Beats in upon you in your selfish homes.

We all may have our homes in joy and peace
When woman's life, in its rich power of love
Is joined with man's to care for all the world.",sestina,verse forms,"['Relationships', 'Home Life', 'Social Commentaries', 'Gender & Sexuality', 'History & Politics', 'Sestina']","Charlotte Perkins Gilman, ""To The Indifferent Women"" from Suffrage Songs and Verses (New York: The Charlton Company, 1911).

My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze. They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries. All honour to you, heroic host of the interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation—in the shadow of a dim delight. 
The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart. I forgot for what I had travelled, and I surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs.

Joseph Seamon Cotter Sr.,1861 – 1949,The Tragedy of Pete,"There was a man
   Whose name was Pete,
And he was a buck
   From his head to his feet.

He loved a dollar,
   But hated a dime;
And so was poor
   Nine-tenths of the time.

The Judge said “Pete,
   What of your wife?”
And Pete replied
   “She lost her life.”

“Pete,” said the Judge,
   “Was it lost in a row?
Tell me quick,
   And tell me how.”

Pete straightened up
   With a hic and a sigh,
Then looked the Judge
   Full in the eye.

“O, Judge, my wife
   Would never go
To a Sunday dance
   Or a movie show.

“But I went, Judge,
   Both day and night,
And came home broke
   And also tight.

“The moon was up,
   My purse was down,
And I was the bully
   Of the bootleg town.

“I was crooning a lilt
   To corn and rye
For the loop in my legs
   And the fight in my eye.

“I met my wife;
   She was wearing a frown,
And catechising
   Her Sunday gown.

‘O Pete, O Pete’
   She cried aloud,
‘The Devil is falling
   Right out of a cloud.’

“I looked straight up
   And fell flat down
And a Ford machine
   Pinned my head to the ground.

“The Ford moved on,
   And my wife was in it;
And I was sober,
   That very minute.

“For my head was bleeding,
   My heart was a-flutter;
And the moonshine within me
   Was tipping the gutter.

“The Ford, it faster
   And faster sped
Till it dipped and swerved
   And my wife was dead.

“Two bruised men lay
   In a hospital ward   
One seeking vengeance,
   The other the Lord.

“He said to me:
   ‘Your wife was drunk,
You are crazy,
   And my Ford is junk.’

“I raised my knife
   And drove it in
At the top of his head
   And the point of his chin.

“O Judge, O Judge,
   If the State has a chair,
Please bind me in it
   And roast me there.”

There was a man
   Whose name was Pete,
And he welcomed death
   From his head to his feet.",ballad,verse forms,"['Ballad', 'Death', 'Drinking', 'Money', 'Public Domain', 'Violence', 'Black History Month']","From Caroling Dusk (Harper & Brothers, 1927), edited by Countee Cullen. This poem is in the public domain.

I linger, for the hay is sweet,
New-cut and curing in the sun.
Like furrows, straight, the windrows run,
Fallen, gallant ranks that tossed and bent
When, yesterday, the west wind went
A-rioting through grass and grain.
To-day no least breath stirs the plain;
Only the hot air, quivering, yields
Illusive motion to the fields
Where not the slenderest tassel swings.
Across the wheat flash sky-blue wings;
A goldfinch dangles from a tall,
Full-flowered yellow mullein; all
The world seems turning blue and gold.
Unstartled, since, even from of old,
Beauty has brought keen sense of her,
I feel the withering grasses stir;
Along the edges of the wheat,
I hear the rustle of her feet:
And yet I know the whole sea lies,
And half the earth, between our eyes.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Summer', 'Couplet']",n/a,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46772/in-harvest,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sophie-jewett,,1861.0,1909.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

Where fairy folk in dancing hours
   Burn stars for candlelight;

Where every wind and leaf can talk,
   But no man understand
Save one whose child-feet chanced to walk
   Green paths of fairyland;

I followed two swift silver wings;
   I stalked a roving song;
I startled shining, silent things;
   I wandered all day long.

But when it seemed the shadowy hours
   Whispered of soft-foot night,
I crept home to sweet common flowers,

Louise Imogen Guiney,1861–1920,Sunday Chimes in the City,"Across the bridge, where in the morning blow 
The wrinkled tide turns homeward, and is fain 
Homeward to drag the black sea-goer’s chain, 
And the long yards by Dowgate dipping low; 
Across dispeopled ways, patient and slow, 
Saint Magnus and Saint Dunstan call in vain: 
From Wren’s forgotten belfries, in the rain, 
Down the blank wharves the dropping octaves go. 
 
Forbid not these! Tho’ no man heed, they shower 
A subtle beauty on the empty hour, 
From all their dark throats aching and outblown; 
Aye in the prayerless places welcome most, 
Like the last gull that up a naked coast 
Deploys her white and steady wing, alone.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Sonnet']","Source:

Richard Calmit Adams,1864 – 1921,A Delaware Indian Legend,"Long, long ago, my people say, as their traditions tell,
They were a happy, powerful race, loved and respected well.
To them belonged the sacred charge, the synagogue to keep,
And every Autumn to the tribes, the Manitou’s praises speak.
And all things went with them full well, the Manitou was pleased;
The Indian race was numerous then, countless as the trees;
The Manitou was kind to them, he filled the woods with game,
And in the rivers and the seas were fish of every name.

And to his children did he give the vast and broad domain;
Some the mountains and valleys took, while others chose the plain;
And everything to comfort them did the Manitou provide,
He gave them fish, game, herbs and maize, and other things beside.
He gave them rivers, lakes and bays, o’er which canoes did glide,
Forests dense and mountains high, great plains the other side.
The men were strong and brave and true, to them belonged the chase,
The women loving, kind and good, who filled a simpler place.

And they were taught while here on earth their spirits to prepare,
To join the Manitou himself, in the happy hunting-ground somewhere;
That they must never lie and steal; must for each other care;
That principles are gems that pass us to that country there.
And even though the wars do come with aggressive tribe or band,
No warrior shall strike a fallen foe, or wrong a helpless hand;
And if your foe shall sue for peace, let not his plea be vain,
Produce the pipe, and smoke with him, smothering the wrathful flame.

And while the smoke ascends above, breathe a prayer together,
That spirits of departed friends make peace beyond the river;
The Manitou’s compassion seek, for he was sorely grieved,
Provide for the widows of the slain, that their needs be relieved.
If a stranger enters in your lodge, give him both food and bed,
E’en if known to be your foe, no harm hangs o’er his head,
For now he is your honored guest, your protection he does claim;
Whate’er your source of difference be, contest it on the plain.

The voice of the Great Spirit now is heard in every clime,
The rumblings of the thunder, the whisperings of the pine;
The works of the Great Spirit are seen on every hand,
Flowers, forests, mountains, stars, sun and even man.
The Lenape all should gather in the Autumn there to praise
The wonders of the Manitou, the goodness of his grace;
And they to tell the Nations what to them he has unbound,
And the way for them to reach the happy hunting-ground.

Once many thousand moons ago, in the synagogue there came
All the tribes and warriors from the forest, hill and plain;
And while they were assembled there a young man rose to say,
The Manitou had shown him in a vision on that day
From afar a huge canoe with pinions spreading wide,
Coming o’er the waters from across the sunrise side;
And in that huge canoe were people of strange dress,
All were armed as warriors, though they peacefulness professed.

They told them of their God, “who came and died for men,”
And they were messengers from Him to save them from their sin,
But first, they said, they must have land, and thus a home prepare,
Then they would teach them truth, and heaven with them share.
The young man to the warriors old his vision further told,
And prophesied that from that day these tempters would grow bold;
That each would have a different creed, to teach a different tribe,
And when one told another each would think the other lied.

The young man for his people lamented loud and long;
He saw the friendship broken that always had been strong,
Dissension, war, and trouble, their happiness succeed,
Tribes rise against each other, their warriors die and bleed.
At last, their faith all shattered, home, game and country gone,
Dejected, broken-hearted, he saw them westward roam.
The Manitou was sorrowful that they should faithless be,
“And now where is the heaven the stranger promised thee?”

And some of the young warriors did live to see the day,
When across the sea from sunrise, with pinions flying gay,
Came great canoes with strangers who soon did boldly land,
And with a friendly gesture, extended the right hand.
Forgetful of the warning, they received them all as friends;
And made the sacred pledges to share with them their lands.
The Indians, true and faithful, their promise did fulfill,
And eager sought the teachings of the white man’s God and will.

And this recalls sweet memories of at least one truthful man;
He made and kept a promise in treating for our land;
His deeds of loving-kindness strength to their teachings lend,
And sacred in our memory is the name of William Penn.
But alas! for faith and trusting, few others like him came,
The white man’s promised friendship, thenceforth we found was vain.
While noble were his teachings, his practice was deceit,
And thus the friends we trusted, our fondest hopes defeat.

And now the road is open across the stormy sea,
The strangers are invaders—our friends no longer be!
Our Manitou is angry, their God hears not our cry,

W. B. Yeats,1865 – 1939,Adam's Curse,"We sat together at one summer's end,
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,
And you and I, and talked of poetry.
I said, ""A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.
Better go down upon your marrow-bones
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;
For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these, and yet
Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen
The martyrs call the world.""
                                              And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake
There's many a one shall find out all heartache
On finding that her voice is sweet and low
Replied, ""To be born woman is to know—
Although they do not talk of it at school—
That we must labour to be beautiful.""
I said, ""It's certain there is no fine thing
Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be
So much compounded of high courtesy
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks
precedents out of beautiful old books;
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.""

We sat grown quiet at the name of love;
We saw the last embers of daylight die,
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell
Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell
About the stars and broke in days and years.
I had a thought for no one's but your ears:
That you were beautiful, and that I strove
To love you in the old high way of love;
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.",ars poetica,types/modes,"['Ars Poetica', 'Audio', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/adams-curse,https://poets.org/poet/w-b-yeats,1903,1865.0,1939.0,['Ars Poetica'],"['Audio', 'Public Domain']",[],Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets
W. B. Yeats,1865 – 1939,The Host of the Air,"O’Driscoll drove with a song, 
The wild duck and the drake, 
From the tall and the tufted weeds 
Of the drear Hart Lake. 

And he saw how the weeds grew dark 
At the coming of night tide, 
And he dreamed of the long dim hair 
Of Bridget his bride. 

He heard while he sang and dreamed 
A piper piping away, 
And never was piping so sad, 
And never was piping so gay. 

And he saw young men and young girls 
Who danced on a level place 
And Bridget his bride among them, 
With a sad and a gay face. 

The dancers crowded about him, 
And many a sweet thing said, 
And a young man brought him red wine 
And a young girl white bread. 

But Bridget drew him by the sleeve, 
Away from the merry bands, 
To old men playing at cards 
With a twinkling of ancient hands. 

The bread and the wine had a doom, 
For these were the host of the air; 
He sat and played in a dream 
Of her long dim hair. 

He played with the merry old men, 
And thought not of evil chance, 
Until one bore Bridget his bride 
Away from the merry dance. 

He bore her away in his arms, 
The handsomest young man there, 
And his neck and his breast and his arms 
Were drowned in her long dim hair. 

O’Driscoll scattered the cards 
And out of his dream awoke: 
Old men and young men and young girls 
Were gone like drifting smoke; 

But he heard high up in the air 
A piper piping away, 
And never was piping so sad, 
And never was piping so gay. ",ballad,verse forms,"['Ballad', 'Audio', 'Dance', 'Desire', 'Dreams', 'Music', 'Myth', 'Public Domain']","This poem is in the public domain. Published in Poem-a-Day on October 21, 2023, by the Academy of American Poets.

Rubén Darío,1867 – 1916,A Sonnet on Cervantes,"In all my days of troubled loneliness
And fretted grief Cervantes is to me
A faithful friend, and none so true as he,
That brings me precious gifts of quietness.

All nature his, and life. Of his largesse
My dreams, that are knight-errants bold and free,
Have golden casques to crown them gloriously.
He is, for me: sigh, prayer, joyousness.

He speaks as runs a brook, so amorous
And very gentle is this Christian knight,
Ever undaunted. And I love him thus,

Beholding how the world, by fate’s design,
Reaps, from his deathless sorrow, rich delight,
And laughter from a madness so divine!

 

Soneto a Cervantes

Horas de pesadumbre y de tristeza
paso en mi soledad. Pero Cervantes
es buen amigo. Endulza mis instantes
ásperos, y reposa mi cabeza.

El es la vida y la naturaleza;
regala un yelmo de oro y de diamantes
a mis sueños errantes.
Es para mí: suspire, ríe y reza.

Poets! Towers of God
Made to resist the fury of the storms
Like cliffs beside the ocean
Or clouded, savage peaks!
Masters of lightning!
Breakwaters of eternity!

Hope, magic-voiced, foretells the day
When on the rock of harmony
The Siren traitorous shall die and pass away,
And there shall only be
The full, frank-billowed music of the sea.

Be hopeful still,
Though bestial elements yet turn
From Song with rancorous ill-will
And blinded races one another spurn!
Perversity debased
Among the high her rebel cry has raised.
The cannibal still lusts after the raw,
Knife-toothed and gory-faced.

Towers, your laughing banners now unfold.
Against all hatreds and all envious lies
Upraise the protest of the breeze, half-told,
And the proud quietness of sea and skies …

    Straying southward like birds o’er the sea, 
      When the flickering sunlight on the dunes
          Is pale, as seagrasses kissed by the spray, 
           Seagrasses that knew the summer of yesterday–
             Sweet are the dreams on the breeze-blown strand! 

Sweet are the dreams on the breeze-blown strand! 
   When cloud skiffs skim athwart the sky
       And like a phantom of yesterday
          The light house shimmers out to sea
             Pale as the sand and the sea-worn spray
               And the straggling sunlight on the dunes. 

Like straggling sunlight on the dunes, 
  Like opal surges that wash the strand 
    With briny fragrance, adoom with the spray, 
        Like wander-birds that career the sky
          To flowerlit isles of some Southern sea-
            Such are the dreams of yesterday! 

Alas, our dreams of yesterday,
   Frail as the fragrance of the dunes, 
     Vain as dark jewels of the sea
        Cast up on some glimmering strand,
          They vanish like cloud sails on the sky, 
             Pale as seagrasses frowsed by the spray.  

Pale as seagrasses kissed by the spray, 
   Is all this life of yesterday,
    All our longings for clear blue skies
       For the low cool plash on autumn dunes, 
          All our musings on tide-left strands
             While birds wing southward o’er the sea. 

Like birds winging southward o’er the sea
   Scattered in air-like wasteful spray, 
     Sea-fancies fading on lonesome strands
       Weary of storm drifts of yesterday,
           Thus our thoughts on the sea-scooped dunes
              When autumn cloudlets fleck the sky.

 Where only yesterday the wild sweet blood of wonderful youth was shed;
 There is a grave whose earth must hold too long, too deep a stain,
 Though for ever over it we may speak as proudly as we may tread.
 But here, where the watchers by lonely hearths from the thrust of an inward sword have more slowly bled,
 We shall build the Cenotaph: Victory, winged, with Peace, winged too, at the column's head.
 And over the stairway, at the foot—oh! here, leave desolate, passionate hands to spread
 Violets, roses, and laurel with the small sweet twinkling country things
 Speaking so wistfully of other Springs
 From the little gardens of little places where son or sweetheart was born and bred.
 In splendid sleep, with a thousand brothers
      To lovers—to mothers
      Here, too, lies he:
 Under the purple, the green, the red,
 It is all young life: it must break some women's hearts to see
 Such a brave, gay coverlet to such a bed!
 Only, when all is done and said,
 God is not mocked and neither are the dead. 
 For this will stand in our Market-place—
      Who'll sell, who'll buy
      (Will you or I
 Lie each to each with the better grace)?

One who had nothing but dreams to give
To men who are eager to labour and live.

For the world in its wisdom deep and dim
Had taken all pleasure and treasure from him.

This was the story his soul could tell,
Immortal and unfathomable.

There was no record in his brain,
He did not know he should live again.

But there was one who read the whole,
Buried deep in a dead man’s soul.

“In the days of Atlantis, under the wave,
I was a slave, the child of a slave.

When the towers of Atlantis fell,
I died and was born again in hell.

From that sorrowful prison I did escape
And hid myself in a hero’s shape.

But few years had I of love or joy,
A Trojan I fell at the Siege of Troy.

I came again in a little while,
An Israelite slave on the banks of the Nile.

Then did I comfort my grief-laden heart.
With the magic lore and Egyptian art.

Fain was I to become Osiris then,
But soon I came back to the world of men.

By the Ganges I was an outcast born,
A wanderer and a child of scorn.

By the Waters of Babylon I wept,
My harp amongst the willows slept.

In the land of Greece I opened my eyes,
To reap the fields of Plotinus the Wise.

When the great light shattered the world’s closed bars,
I was a shepherd who gazed at the stars.

For lives that were lonely, obscure, apart,
I thank the Hidden One, in my heart,

That always and always under the sun
I went forth to battle and never won.

A slayer of men, I was doomed to abide,
For ever and aye, on the losing side.

Whenever. I dream of the wonderful goal,
I thank the hidden God in my soul

That though I have always been meanly born,
A tiller of earth and a reaper of corn,

Whenever through ages past and gone
The light divine for a moment shone,

Whenever piercing laborious night
A ray fell straight from the Light of Light,

Whenever amid fierce, lightning and storm
The divine moved in a human form,

Whenever the earth in her cyclic course
Shook at the touch of an unknown force,

Whenever the cloud of dull years grew thin
And a great star called to the light within,

I have braved storm and labour and sun
To stand at the side that Holy One.

No matter how humble my birth has been,
There are few who have seen what I have seen.

Mine the shepherd’s star and the reaper’s reward,
And the dream of him who fell by the sword.

One thing I have learned the long years through,
To know the false words from the true.

The slave who toiled on the banks of the Nile
With wisdom gladdened his long exile.

From Buddha at eve by the Ganges’ side
An outcast learnt the worth of the world’s pride.

To the tired reaper, when day was done,
Did Plotinus unveil the hidden sun.

Amongst the stars, on a Syrian night,
A ragged shepherd found the Light of Light.

From dream to dream, o’er valley and hill,
I followed the Lord Christ's wandering will.

Kings there are who would barter a throne
For the long day’s toil and the light unknown,

The deed of the strong and the word of the wise,
And the night under cold and starry skies—

The white light of dawn on the hillside shed
On Him who had nowhere to lay His head.

Behold there are kings who would change with me,
For the love of the ancient mystery.

Shepherd and reaper and slave I have been,
There are few who have seen what I have seen.

I have been a gipsy since those days,
And lived again in the wild wood ways.

Wise with the lore of those hidden things,
Learnt from Lord Christ in His wanderings,

Beggar and reaper and shepherd and slave,
I am one who rests not in any grave;

I will follow each stormy light divine,
And the secret of all things shall be mine.

These things have I seen, would you bid me mourn
That I was never an Emperor born?”",couplet,stanza forms,"['Travels & Journeys', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Fairy-tales & Legends', 'Couplet']","Eva Gore-Booth, “The Vagrant's Romance” from Poems of Eva Gore-Booth (London: Longmans, Green, 1929).

   Their footsteps drag far, far below the height, 
   And, unprevailing by their utmost might, 
Seem faltering downward from each hard won place. 
No strange, swift-sprung exception we; we trace 
   A devious way thro’ dim, uncertain light,— 
   Our hope, through the long vistaed years, a sight 
Of that our Captain’s soul sees face to face.

Now raiseth up his drear insistent cry?

   Disdaining kinship with my fellow man;
Alike to me were human smiles and tears,
   I cared not whither Earth's great life-stream ran,
Till as I knelt before my mouldered shrine,
   God made me look into a woman's eyes;
And I, who thought all earthly wisdom mine,
   Knew in a moment that the eternal skies
Were measured but in inches, to the quest
   That lay before me in that mystic gaze.

Paul Laurence Dunbar,1872–1906,The Haunted Oak,"Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
   Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
   Runs a shudder over me?

My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
   And sap ran free in my veins,
But I saw in the moonlight dim and weird
   A guiltless victim's pains.

I bent me down to hear his sigh;
   I shook with his gurgling moan,
And I trembled sore when they rode away,
   And left him here alone.

They'd charged him with the old, old crime,
   And set him fast in jail:
Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
   And why does the night wind wail?

He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
   And he raised his hand to the sky;
But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
   And the steady tread drew nigh.

Who is it rides by night, by night,
   Over the moonlit road?
And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
   What is the galling goad?

And now they beat at the prison door,
   ""Ho, keeper, do not stay!
We are friends of him whom you hold within,
   And we fain would take him away

""From those who ride fast on our heels
   With mind to do him wrong;
They have no care for his innocence,
   And the rope they bear is long.""

They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
   They have fooled the man with lies;
The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
   And the great door open flies.

Now they have taken him from the jail,
   And hard and fast they ride,
And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
   As they halt my trunk beside.

Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
   And the doctor one of white,
And the minister, with his oldest son,
   Was curiously bedight.

Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
   'Tis but a little space,
And the time will come when these shall dread
   The mem'ry of your face.

I feel the rope against my bark,
   And the weight of him in my grain,
I feel in the throe of his final woe
   The touch of my own last pain.

And never more shall leaves come forth
   On the bough that bears the ban;
I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
   From the curse of a guiltless man.

And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
   And goes to hunt the deer,
And ever another rides his soul
   In the guise of a mortal fear.

And ever the man he rides me hard,
   And never a night stays he;
For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,

Like threads of tortured silver. . .while the guards—
Monstrous deft dolls that move as on a string,
In wonted haste to finish with this thing,
Turn faces blanker than asphalted yards.

They heard the shriek that tore out of its sheath
But as a feeble moan. . .yet dared not breathe,

  This perfect beauty; waves within a tide,
Or single notes amid a glorious throng.

The painted trillium smiles, while crisp pine cones

By shortening moments, when no gaunt presage
Of undone duties, modern heritage,

And bearing silence with thee disengage
    Our twined fortunes? Deeps of unhewn woods

Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
And to the forest edge you came one day

But did not enter, though the wish was strong: 
You shook your pensive head as who should say,
‘I dare not—too far in his footsteps stray—
He must seek me would he undo the wrong.’

Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all
Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;

And tell you that I saw does still abide.

Robert Frost,1874 – 1963,My Butterfly,"Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,
And the daft sun-assaulter, he
That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead:
Save only me
(Nor is it sad to thee!)
Save only me
There is none left to mourn thee in the fields.

The gray grass is not dappled with the snow;
Its two banks have not shut upon the river;
But it is long ago—
It seems forever—
Since first I saw thee flance,
With all the dazzling other ones,
In airy dalliance,
Precipitate in love,
Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,
Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.

When that was, the soft mist
Of my regret hung not on all the land,
And I was glad for thee,
And glad for me, I wist.

Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,
That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,
With those great careless wings,
Nor yet did I.

And there were other things:
It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp:
Then fearful he had let thee win
Too far beyond him to be gathered in,
Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp.

Ah! I remember me
How once conspiracty was rife
Against my life—
The languor of it and the dreaming fond;
Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,
The breeze three odors brought,
And a gem-flower waved in a wand!

Then when I was distraught
And could not speak,
Sidelong, full on my cheek,
What should that reckless zephyr fling
But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!

I found that wing broken to-day!
For thou art dead, I said,
And the strange birds say.
I found it with the withered leaves

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,Spring Day,"Bath
  The day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air.
  The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white. It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light.
  Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. I move a foot, and the planes of light in the water jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots.
  The sky is blue and high. A crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air.

      Breakfast Table
  In the fresh-washed sunlight, the breakfast table is decked and white. It offers itself in flat surrender, tendering tastes, and smells, and colours, and metals, and grains, and the white cloth falls over its side, draped and wide. Wheels of white glitter in the silver coffee-pot, hot and spinning like catherine-wheels, they whirl, and twirl—and my eyes begin to smart, the little white, dazzling wheels prick them like darts. Placid and peaceful, the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask. A stack of butter-pats, pyramidal, shout orange through the white, scream, flutter, call: “Yellow! Yellow! Yellow!” Coffee steam rises in a stream, clouds the silver tea-service with mist, and twists up into the sunlight, revolved, involuted, suspiring higher and higher, fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky. A crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam. The day is new and fair with good smells in the air.

      Walk
  Over the street the white clouds meet, and sheer away without touching.
  On the sidewalks, boys are playing marbles. Glass marbles, with amber and blue hearts, roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise. The boys strike them with black and red striped agates. The glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit, and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water. I smell tulips and narcissus in the air, but there are no flowers anywhere, only white dust whipping up the street, and a girl with a gay Spring hat and blowing skirts. The dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat, high-heeled patent leather shoes. Tap, tap, the little heels pat the pavement, and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat.
  A water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way. It is green and gay with new paint, and rumbles contentedly, sprinkling clear water over the white dust. Clear zigzagging water, which smells of tulips and narcissus.
  The thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky.
  Whoop! The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time. Whoop! And a man’s hat careers down the street in front of the white dust, leaps into the branches of a tree, veers away and trundles ahead of the wind, jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green.
  A motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air, sharp-beaked, irresistible, shouting to the wind to make way. A glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it, and settles down. The sky is quiet and high, and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air.

      Midday and Afternoon
  Swirl of crowded streets. Shock and recoil of traffic. The stock-still brick façade of an old church, against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw. Flare of sunshine down side-streets. Eddies of light in the windows of chemists’ shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars, darting colours far into the crowd. Loud bangs and tremors, murmurings out of high windows, whirring of machine belts, blurring of horses and motors. A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car, and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky. I am a piece of the town, a bit of blown dust, thrust along with the crowd. Proud to feel the pavement under me, reeling with feet. Feet tripping, skipping, lagging, dragging, plodding doggedly, or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps. A boy is selling papers, I smell them clean and new from the press. They are fresh like the air, and pungent as tulips and narcissus.
  The blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows, putting out their contents in a flood of flame.

      Night and Sleep
  The day takes her ease in slippered yellow. Electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts, following each other. They grow, and grow, and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades. Trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night. Twinkle, jab, snap, that means a new play; and over the way: plop, drop, quiver, is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker’s sign with its length on another street. A gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building, but the sky is high and has her own stars, why should she heed ours?
  I leave the city with speed. Wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness. The breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean, it has come but recently from the high sky. There are no flowers in bloom yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus.
  My room is tranquil and friendly. Out of the window I can see the distant city, a band of twinkling gems, little flower-heads with no stems. I cannot see the beer-glass, nor the letters of the restaurants and shops I passed, now the signs blur and all together make the city, glowing on a night of fine weather, like a garden stirring and blowing for the Spring.
  The night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air.
  Wrap me close, sheets of lavender. Pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears. The breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days, and cobbled streets, and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways. Pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair . . . I smell the stars . . . they are like tulips and narcissus . . .

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,Towns in Colour,"I   Red Slippers

  Red slippers in a shop-window, and outside in the street, flaws of grey, windy sleet!
  Behind the polished glass, the slippers hang in long threads of red, festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood, flooding the eyes of passers-by with dripping colour, jamming their crimson reflections against the windows of cabs and tram-cars, screaming their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet, plopping their little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas.
  The row of white, sparkling shop fronts is gashed and bleeding, it bleeds red slippers. They spout under the electric light, fluid and fluctuating, a hot rain—and freeze again to red slippers, myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window.
  They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer; they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket; they flatten out, heelless, like July ponds, flared and burnished by red rockets.
  Snap, snap, they are cracker-sparks of scarlet in the white, monotonous block of shops.
  They plunge the clangour of billions of vermilion trumpets into the crowd outside, and echo in faint rose over the pavement.
  People hurry by, for these are only shoes, and in a window, farther down, is a big lotus bud of cardboard whose petals open every few minutes and reveal a wax doll, with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair, lolling awkwardly in its flower chair.
  One has often seen shoes, but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before?
  The flaws of grey, windy sleet beat on the shop-window where there are only red slippers.

      II   Thompson’s Lunch Room—Grand Central Station
   Study in Whites
Wax-white—
 Floor, ceiling, walls.
 Ivory shadows
 Over the pavement
 Polished to cream surfaces
 By constant sweeping.
 The big room is coloured like the petals
 Of a great magnolia,
 And has a patina
 Of flower bloom
 Which makes it shine dimly
 Under the electric lamps.
 Chairs are ranged in rows
 Like sepia seeds
 Waiting fulfilment.
 The chalk-white spot of a cook’s cap
 Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall—
 Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow
 Through the wavering uncertainty of steam.
 Vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections,
 Ice-green carboys, shifting—greener, bluer—with the jar of moving water.
 Jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass
 Rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar
 Above the lighthouse-shaped castors
 Of grey pepper and grey-white salt.
 Grey-white placards: “Oyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, Frankfurters”:
 Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines.
 Dropping on the white counter like horn notes
 Through a web of violins,
 The flat yellow lights of oranges,
 The cube-red splashes of apples,
 In high plated  épergnes.
 The electric clock jerks every half-minute:
 “Coming!—Past!”
 “Three beef-steaks and a chicken-pie,”
 Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily.
 A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair.
 Two rice puddings and a salmon salad
 Are pushed over the counter;
 The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them.
 A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone,
 And the sound throws across the room
 Sharp, invisible zigzags
 Of silver.

      III   An Opera House
Within the gold square of the proscenium arch,
 A curtain of orange velvet hangs in stiff folds,
 Its tassels jarring slightly when someone crosses the stage behind.
 Gold carving edges the balconies,
 Rims the boxes,
 Runs up and down fluted pillars.
 Little knife-stabs of gold
 Shine out whenever a box door is opened.
 Gold clusters
 Flash in soft explosions
 On the blue darkness,
 Suck back to a point,
 And disappear.
 Hoops of gold
 Circle necks, wrists, fingers,
 Pierce ears,
 Poise on heads
 And fly up above them in coloured sparkles.
 Gold!
 Gold!
 The opera house is a treasure-box of gold.
 Gold in a broad smear across the orchestra pit:
 Gold of horns, trumpets, tubas;
 Gold—spun-gold, twittering-gold, snapping-gold
 Of harps.
 The conductor raises his baton,
 The brass blares out
 Crass, crude,
 Parvenu, fat, powerful,
 Golden.
 Rich as the fat, clapping hands in the boxes.
 Cymbals, gigantic, coin-shaped,
 Crash.
 The orange curtain parts
 And the prima-donna steps forward.
 One note,
 A drop: transparent, iridescent,
 A gold bubble,
 It floats . . . floats . . .
 And bursts against the lips of a bank president
 In the grand tier.

      IV   Afternoon Rain in State Street
Cross-hatchings of rain against grey walls,
 Slant lines of black rain
 In front of the up and down, wet stone sides of buildings.
 Below,
 Greasy, shiny, black, horizontal,
 The street.
 And over it, umbrellas,
 Black polished dots
 Struck to white
 An instant,
 Stream in two flat lines
 Slipping past each other with the smoothness of oil.
 Like a four-sided wedge
 The Custom House Tower
 Pokes at the low, flat sky,
 Pushing it farther and farther up,
 Lifting it away from the house-tops,
 Lifting it in one piece as though it were a sheet of tin,
 With the lever of its apex.
 The cross-hatchings of rain cut the Tower obliquely,
 Scratching lines of black wire across it,
 Mutilating its perpendicular grey surface
 With the sharp precision of tools.
 The city is rigid with straight lines and angles,
 A chequered table of blacks and greys.
 Oblong blocks of flatness
 Crawl by with low-geared engines,
 And pass to short upright squares
 Shrinking with distance.
 A steamer in the basin blows its whistle,
 And the sound shoots across the rain hatchings,
 A narrow, level bar of steel.
 Hard cubes of lemon
 Superimpose themselves upon the fronts of buildings
 As the windows light up.
 But the lemon cubes are edged with angles
 Upon which they cannot impinge.
 Up, straight, down, straight—square.
 Crumpled grey-white papers
 Blow along the side-walks,
 Contorted, horrible,
 Without curves.
 A horse steps in a puddle,
 A white, glaring water spurts up
 In stiff, outflaring lines,
 Like the rattling stems of reeds.
 The city is heraldic with angles,
 A sombre escutcheon of argent and sable
 And countercoloured bends of rain
 Hung over a four-square civilization.
 When a street lamp comes out,
 I gaze at it for full thirty seconds
 To rest my brain with the suffusing, round brilliance of its globe.

      V   An Aquarium
Streaks of green and yellow iridescence,
 Silver shiftings,
 Rings veering out of rings,
 Silver—gold—
 Grey-green opaqueness sliding down,
 With sharp white bubbles
 Shooting and dancing,
 Flinging quickly outward.
 Nosing the bubbles,
 Swallowing them,
 Fish.
 Blue shadows against silver-saffron water,
 The light rippling over them
 In steel-bright tremors.
 Outspread translucent fins
 Flute, fold, and relapse;
 The threaded light prints through them on the pebbles
 In scarcely tarnished twinklings.
 Curving of spotted spines,
 Slow up-shifts,
 Lazy convolutions:
 Then a sudden swift straightening
 And darting below:
 Oblique grey shadows
 Athwart a pale casement.
 Roped and curled,
 Green man-eating eels
 Slumber in undulate rhythms,
 With crests laid horizontal on their backs.
 Barred fish,
 Striped fish,
 Uneven disks of fish,
 Slip, slide, whirl, turn,
 And never touch.
 Metallic blue fish,
 With fins wide and yellow and swaying
 Like Oriental fans,
 Hold the sun in their bellies
 And glow with light:
 Blue brilliance cut by black bars.
 An oblong pane of straw-coloured shimmer,
 Across it, in a tangent,
 A smear of rose, black, silver.
 Short twists and upstartings,
 Rose-black, in a setting of bubbles:
 Sunshine playing between red and black flowers
 On a blue and gold lawn.
 Shadows and polished surfaces,
 Facets of mauve and purple,
 A constant modulation of values.
 Shaft-shaped,
 With green bead eyes;
 Thick-nosed,
 Heliotrope-coloured;
 Swift spots of chrysolite and coral;
 In the midst of green, pearl, amethyst irradiations.
Outside,
 A willow-tree flickers
 With little white jerks,
 And long blue waves
 Rise steadily beyond the outer islands.",prose poem,types/modes,"['Nature', 'Weather', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Free Verse', 'Prose Poem']","Source:

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,The Broken Fountain,"Oblong, its jutted ends rounding into circles,
The old sunken basin lies with its flat, marble lip
An inch below the terrace tiles.
Over the stagnant water
Slide reflections:
The blue-green of coned yews;
The purple and red of trailing fuchsias
Dripping out of marble urns;
Bright squares of sky
Ribbed by the wake of a swimming beetle.
Through the blue-bronze water
Wavers the pale uncertainty of a shadow.
An arm flashes through the reflections,
A breast is outlined with leaves.
Outstretched in the quiet water
The statue of a Goddess slumbers.

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,In a Garden,"Gushing from the mouths of stone men
To spread at ease under the sky
In granite-lipped basins,
Where iris dabble their feet
And rustle to a passing wind,
The water fills the garden with its rushing,
In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns.

Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,   
Where trickle and plash the fountains,   
Marble fountains, yellowed with much water.

Splashing down moss-tarnished steps   
It falls, the water;
And the air is throbbing with it;
With its gurgling and running;
With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur.

And I wished for night and you.
I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,   
White and shining in the silver-flecked water.

While the moon rode over the garden,   
High in the arch of night,
And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness.

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,The Blue Scarf,"Pale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded
In smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes, it lies there,
Warm from a woman’s soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, caressing.
Where is she, the woman who wore it? The scent of her lingers and drugs me.
A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush the scarf down on my face,
And gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens.
Around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement.
Rose-leaves blow and patter against it. Below the stone steps a lute tinkles.
A jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor. A big-bellied
Frog hops through the sunlight, and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin,
Sunk in the black and white marble. The west wind has lifted a scarf
On the seat close beside me; the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour.
She draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath her slight stirring.
Her kisses are sharp buds of fire; and I burn back against her, a jewel
Hard and white, a stalked, flaming flower; till I break to a handful of cinders,
And open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon sunshine.

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,A London Thoroughfare. 2 A.M.,"They have watered the street,
 It shines in the glare of lamps,
 Cold, white lamps,
 And lies
 Like a slow-moving river,
 Barred with silver and black.
 Cabs go down it,
 One,
 And then another.
 Between them I hear the shuffling of feet.
 Tramps doze on the window-ledges,
 Night-walkers pass along the sidewalks.
 The city is squalid and sinister,
 With the silver-barred street in the midst,
 Slow-moving,
 A river leading nowhere.
Opposite my window,
 The moon cuts,
 Clear and round,
 Through the plum-coloured night.
 She cannot light the city;
 It is too bright.
 It has white lamps,
 And glitters coldly.
I stand in the window and watch the moon.
 She is thin and lustreless,
 But I love her.
 I know the moon,
 And this is an alien city.",free verse,meters,"['Nature', 'Stars, Planets, Heavens', 'Social Commentaries', 'Cities & Urban Life', 'Free Verse', 'Imagist']","Source:

 Thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine,
 Liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds,
 A pike dozed.
 Lost among the shadows of stems
 He lay unnoticed.
 Suddenly he flicked his tail,
 And a green-and-copper brightness
 Ran under the water.
Out from under the reeds
 Came the olive-green light,

 Through the sun-thickened water.

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,Towns in Colour,"I   Red Slippers

  Red slippers in a shop-window, and outside in the street, flaws of grey, windy sleet!
  Behind the polished glass, the slippers hang in long threads of red, festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood, flooding the eyes of passers-by with dripping colour, jamming their crimson reflections against the windows of cabs and tram-cars, screaming their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet, plopping their little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas.
  The row of white, sparkling shop fronts is gashed and bleeding, it bleeds red slippers. They spout under the electric light, fluid and fluctuating, a hot rain—and freeze again to red slippers, myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window.
  They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer; they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket; they flatten out, heelless, like July ponds, flared and burnished by red rockets.
  Snap, snap, they are cracker-sparks of scarlet in the white, monotonous block of shops.
  They plunge the clangour of billions of vermilion trumpets into the crowd outside, and echo in faint rose over the pavement.
  People hurry by, for these are only shoes, and in a window, farther down, is a big lotus bud of cardboard whose petals open every few minutes and reveal a wax doll, with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair, lolling awkwardly in its flower chair.
  One has often seen shoes, but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before?
  The flaws of grey, windy sleet beat on the shop-window where there are only red slippers.

      III   An Opera House
Within the gold square of the proscenium arch,
 A curtain of orange velvet hangs in stiff folds,
 Its tassels jarring slightly when someone crosses the stage behind.
 Gold carving edges the balconies,
 Rims the boxes,
 Runs up and down fluted pillars.
 Little knife-stabs of gold
 Shine out whenever a box door is opened.
 Gold clusters
 Flash in soft explosions
 On the blue darkness,
 Suck back to a point,
 And disappear.
 Hoops of gold
 Circle necks, wrists, fingers,
 Pierce ears,
 Poise on heads
 And fly up above them in coloured sparkles.
 Gold!
 Gold!
 The opera house is a treasure-box of gold.
 Gold in a broad smear across the orchestra pit:
 Gold of horns, trumpets, tubas;
 Gold—spun-gold, twittering-gold, snapping-gold
 Of harps.
 The conductor raises his baton,
 The brass blares out
 Crass, crude,
 Parvenu, fat, powerful,
 Golden.
 Rich as the fat, clapping hands in the boxes.
 Cymbals, gigantic, coin-shaped,
 Crash.
 The orange curtain parts
 And the prima-donna steps forward.
 One note,
 A drop: transparent, iridescent,
 A gold bubble,
 It floats . . . floats . . .
 And bursts against the lips of a bank president
 In the grand tier.

Cross-hatchings of rain against grey walls,

 Crumpled grey-white papers

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,The Artist,"Why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples?   
Why do you dim yourself with folded silks?
Do you not see that I can buy brocades in any draper’s shop,   
And that I am choked in the twilight of all these colors.
How pale you would be, and startling—  
How quiet;
But your curves would spring upward   
Like a clear jet of flung water,
You would quiver like a shot-up spray of water,   
You would waver, and relapse, and tremble.   
And I too should tremble,
Watching.

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,Penumbra,"As I sit here in the quiet Summer night,
Suddenly, from the distant road, there comes
The grind and rush of an electric car.
And, from still farther off,
An engine puffs sharply,
Followed by the drawn-out shunting scrape of a freight train.
These are the sounds that men make
In the long business of living.
They will always make such sounds,
Years after I am dead and cannot hear them.

Sitting here in the Summer night,
I think of my death.
What will it be like for you then?
You will see my chair
With its bright chintz covering
Standing in the afternoon sunshine,
As now.
You will see my narrow table
At which I have written so many hours.
My dogs will push their noses into your hand,
And ask—ask—
Clinging to you with puzzled eyes.

The old house will still be here,
The old house which has known me since the beginning.
The walls which have watched me while I played:
Soldiers, marbles, paper-dolls,
Which have protected me and my books.
The front-door will gaze down among the old trees
Where, as a child, I hunted ghosts and Indians;
It will look out on the wide gravel sweep
Where I rolled my hoop,
And at the rhododendron bushes
Where I caught black-spotted butterflies.

The old house will guard you,
As I have done.
Its walls and rooms will hold you,
And I shall whisper my thoughts and fancies
As always,
From the pages of my books.

You will sit here, some quiet Summer night,
Listening to the puffing trains,
But you will not be lonely,
For these things are a part of me.
And my love will go on speaking to you
Through the chairs, and the tables, and the pictures,
As it does now through my voice,
And the quick, necessary touch of my hand.",free verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Growing Old', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Nature', 'Summer', 'Free Verse']","Amy Lowell, “Penumbra” from The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell.

The trees glittered with the tumbling of leaves;
The sidewalks shone like alleys of dropped maple leaves,
And the houses ran along them laughing out of square, open windows.
Under a tree in the park,
Two little boys, lying flat on their faces,
Were carefully gathering red berries
To put in a pasteboard box.
Some day there will be no war,
Then I shall take out this afternoon
And turn it in my fingers,
And remark the sweet taste of it upon my palate,
And note the crisp variety of its flights of leaves.

The old sunken basin lies with its flat, marble lip
An inch below the terrace tiles.
Over the stagnant water
Slide reflections:
The blue-green of coned yews;
The purple and red of trailing fuchsias
Dripping out of marble urns;
Bright squares of sky
Ribbed by the wake of a swimming beetle.
Through the blue-bronze water
Wavers the pale uncertainty of a shadow.

A breast is outlined with leaves.

The statue of a Goddess slumbers.

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,Dreams in War Time,"I
I wandered through a house of many rooms.
It grew darker and darker,
Until, at last, I could only find my way
By passing my fingers along the wall.
Suddenly my hand shot through an open window,
And the thorn of a rose I could not see
Pricked it so sharply
That I cried aloud.
      II
I dug a grave under an oak-tree.
With infinite care, I stamped my spade
Into the heavy grass.
The sod sucked it,
And I drew it out with effort,
Watching the steel run liquid in the moonlight
As it came clear.
I stooped, and dug, and never turned,
For behind me,
On the dried leaves,
My own face lay like a white pebble,
Waiting.
      III
I gambled with a silver money.
The dried seed-vessels of “honesty”
Were stacked in front of me.
Dry, white years slipping through my fingers
One by one.
One by one, gathered by the Croupier.
“Faites vos jeux, Messieurs.”
I staked on the red,
And the black won.
Dry years, 
Dead years;
But I had a system,
I always staked on the red.
      IV
I painted the leaves of bushes red
And shouted: “Fire! Fire!”
But the neighbors only laughed.
“We cannot warm our hands at them,” they said.
Then they cut down my bushes,
And made a bonfire,
And danced about it.
But I covered my face and wept,
For ashes are not beautiful
Even in the dawn.
      V
I followed a procession of singing girls
Who danced to the glitter of tambourines. 
Where the street turned at a lighted corner,
I caught the purple dress of one of the dancers,
But, as I grasped it, it tore,
And the purple dye ran from it
Like blood
Upon the ground.
      VI
I wished to post a letter,
But although I paid much,
Still the letter was overweight.
“What is in this package?” said the clerk,
“It is very heavy.”
“Yes,” I said,
“And yet it is only a dried fruit.”
      VII
I had made a kite,
On it I had pasted golden stars 
And white torches,
And the tail was spotted scarlet like a tiger-lily,
And very long.
I flew my kite,
And my soul was contented
Watching it flash against the concave of the sky.
My friends pointed at the clouds;
They begged me to take in my kite.
But I was happy
Seeing the mirror shock of it
Against the black clouds.
Then the lightning came
And struck the kite.
It puffed—blazed—fell.
But still I walked on,
In the drowning rain,
Slowly winding up the string.",free verse,meters,"['Living', 'Relationships', 'Philosophy', 'Free Verse', 'Imagist']","Source:

Amy Lowell,1874–1925,Lilacs,"Lilacs,
False blue,
White,
Purple,
Color of lilac,
Your great puffs of flowers
Are everywhere in this my New England.
Among your heart-shaped leaves
Orange orioles hop like music-box birds and sing
Their little weak soft songs;
In the crooks of your branches
The bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted eggs
Peer restlessly through the light and shadow
Of all Springs.
Lilacs in dooryards
Holding quiet conversations with an early moon;
Lilacs watching a deserted house
Settling sideways into the grass of an old road;
Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of bloom
Above a cellar dug into a hill.
You are everywhere.
You were everywhere.
You tapped the window when the preacher preached his sermon,
And ran along the road beside the boy going to school.
You stood by the pasture-bars to give the cows good milking,
You persuaded the housewife that her dishpan was of silver.
And her husband an image of pure gold.
You flaunted the fragrance of your blossoms
Through the wide doors of Custom Houses—
You, and sandal-wood, and tea,
Charging the noses of quill-driving clerks
When a ship was in from China.
You called to them: “Goose-quill men, goose-quill men,
May is a month for flitting.”
Until they writhed on their high stools
And wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up ledgers.
Paradoxical New England clerks,
Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the “Song of Solomon” at night,
So many verses before bed-time,
Because it was the Bible.
The dead fed you
Amid the slant stones of graveyards.
Pale ghosts who planted you
Came in the nighttime
And let their thin hair blow through your clustered stems.
You are of the green sea,
And of the stone hills which reach a long distance.
You are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell kites and marbles,
You are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at home.
You cover the blind sides of greenhouses
And lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the glass
To your friends, the grapes, inside.

Lilacs,
False blue,
White,
Purple,
Color of lilac,
You have forgotten your Eastern origin,
The veiled women with eyes like panthers,
The swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled pashas.
Now you are a very decent flower,
A reticent flower,
A curiously clear-cut, candid flower,
Standing beside clean doorways,
Friendly to a house-cat and a pair of spectacles,
Making poetry out of a bit of moonlight
And a hundred or two sharp blossoms.
Maine knows you,
Has for years and years;
New Hampshire knows you,
And Massachusetts
And Vermont.
Cape Cod starts you along the beaches to Rhode Island;
Connecticut takes you from a river to the sea.
You are brighter than apples,
Sweeter than tulips,
You are the great flood of our souls
Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our hearts,
You are the smell of all Summers,
The love of wives and children,
The recollection of gardens of little children,
You are State Houses and Charters
And the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it knows.
May is lilac here in New England,
May is a thrush singing “Sun up!” on a tip-top ash tree,
May is white clouds behind pine-trees
Puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.
May is a green as no other,
May is much sun through small leaves,
May is soft earth,
And apple-blossoms,
And windows open to a South Wind.
May is full light wind of lilac
From Canada to Narragansett Bay.

Lilacs,
False blue,
White,
Purple,
Color of lilac.
Heart-leaves of lilac all over New England,
Roots of lilac under all the soil of New England,
Lilac in me because I am New England,
Because my roots are in it,
Because my leaves are of it,
Because my flowers are for it,
Because it is my country
And I speak to it of itself
And sing of it with my own voice
Since certainly it is mine.",free verse,meters,"['Nature', 'Spring', 'Trees & Flowers', 'Free Verse']","Amy Lowell, “Lilacs” from The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell.

Ameen Rihani,1876 – 1940,In Memory of E. M. EL—K.,"When my parched lips upon thy princely brow, 
    Placid as tropic mead, as glacier cold,
Imprinted a last farewell, where wert thou­—
    Where didst thy soul its loveliness unfold? 

Can’t be that in some undiscovered sphere
    The Muses sing their souls to thine in bliss?
Can’t be that when I kiss thy forehead here
    A thousand angels echo there my kiss?

What is this mask, where is the soul, O where, 
    And from these eyes, O God, where went the light?
My silence cries within me in despair, 
    My reason’s sinking in this sea of Night. 

Esau, I am beside thee now alone, 
    I dare not weep, I dare not even breathe;
But through the stillness something hither blown
    Makes of thine amber locks a golden wreath. 

Life flutters in thy hair as in mine eyes; 
    Death can not choke the breeze that whispers there
A word of hope; beneath my breath will rise 
    A hair with God eternity to share

The noon and eve of Life thou didst not see, 
    But in its Dawn thou didst anticipate 
What jealous Night would not permit to be, 
    What pain and suffering never could abate. 

Shall I strew on thee faded blossoms, Brother,
    Or fiery buds consumed by their own flame, 
Or myrrh and myrtle from our Mountain-mother, 
    Or golden rods that whispered oft thy name?

Or, at the shrine of Liberty and Love, 
    Where thou didst worship ardently and die,

Unfold a wondrous wealth of worlds unseen,

The silvery cascades, or the billows green,
And either a sea of bliss or grief recalls.

‘Colonies I made free from a tyrant’s crown;’—
So each Day told its immortality.

Whereby men take hold of it
And mark it with signs for its remembrance.
It is a river, this language,
Once in a thousand years
Breaking a new course
Changing its way to the ocean.
It is mountain effluvia
Moving to valleys
And from nation to nation
Crossing borders and mixing.
Languages die like rivers.

And broken to shape of thought
Between your teeth and lips speaking

Shall be faded hieroglyphics

Adelaide Crapsey,1878–1914,To The Dead in the Graveyard Underneath My Window,"Written in A Moment of Exasperation

How can you lie so still? All day I watch
And never a blade of all the green sod moves
To show where restlessly you toss and turn,
And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees
Stiffened and aching from their long disuse;
I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth
To take its freedom of the midnight hour.
Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones?
The very worms must scorn you where you lie,
A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk,
Meek habitants of unresented graves.
Why are you there in your straight row on row
Where I must ever see you from my bed
That in your mere dumb presence iterate
The text so weary in my ears: ""Lie still
And rest; be patient and lie still and rest.""
I'll not be patient! I will not lie still!
There is a brown road runs between the pines,
And further on the purple woodlands lie,
And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom;
And I would walk the road and I would be
Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach
The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds.
My eyes may follow but my feet are held.
Recumbent as you others must I too
Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness
With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod?
And if the many sayings of the wise
Teach of submission I will not submit
But with a spirit all unreconciled
Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars.
Better it is to walk, to run, to dance,
Better it is to laugh and leap and sing,
To know the open skies of dawn and night,
To move untrammeled down the flaming noon,
And I will clamour it through weary days
Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp,
Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips
Of resignation, sister to defeat.
I'll not be patient. I will not lie still.

And in ironic quietude who is
The despot of our days and lord of dust
Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop
Grim casual comment on rebellion's end;
""Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now
As dead and quiet as the others are.""
And this each body and ghost of you hath heard
That in your graves do therefore lie so still.",blank verse,meters,"['Living', 'Death', 'Religion', 'God & the Divine', 'Arts & Sciences', 'Music', 'Theater & Dance', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Ghosts & the Supernatural', 'Horror', 'Blank Verse', 'Imagery']","Adelaide Crapsey, ""To The Dead in the Graveyard Underneath My Window"" from Verse.

Rise up and scatter

The same dragging of feet up the same well-worn path 
To the same well-worn rock; 
The same crimson or gold dropping away of the sun 
The same tints—rose, saffron, violet, lavender, grey

Before me the same blue black cedar rising jaggedly to a point; 
Over it, the same slow unlidding of twin stars, 
Two eyes, unfathomable, soul-searing, 
Watching, watching—watching me; 
The same two eyes that draw me forth, against my will dusk after dusk;

Else fandom shouteth: “Who said you could play?
      Back to the jasper league, you minor slob!”

So pitch that every man can but admire
      And offer you the freedom of the town—
This is the end of every fan’s desire.

The burden of loud cheering. O the sounds!
      The tumult and the shouting from the throats
Of forty thousand at the Polo Grounds
      Sitting, ay, standing sans their hats and coats.
      A mighty cheer that possibly denotes
That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire;
      Or, as H. James would say, We’ve got their goats—
This is the end of every fan’s desire.

The burden of a pennant. O the hope,
      The tenuous hope, the hope that’s half a fear,
The lengthy season and the boundless dope,
      And the bromidic; “Wait until next year.”
      O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear,
O Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher
      That next October it shall flutter here:

And what’s the roar I hear in shells,
      And when will Christmas come?
And why the grass is always green,
      Instead of sometimes blue,
And why a bean will grow a bean
      And not an apple, too?
And why a horse can’t learn to moo,
      And why a cow can’t neigh?
And do the fairies live on dew,

William Carlos Williams,1883 – 1963,The Uses of Poetry,"I've fond anticipation of a day
O'erfilled with pure diversion presently,
For I must read a lady poesy
The while we glide by many a leafy bay,

Hid deep in rushes, where at random play
The glossy black winged May-flies, or whence flee
Hush-throated nestlings in alarm,
Whom we have idly frighted with our boat's long sway.

For, lest o'ersaddened by such woes as spring
To rural peace from our meek onward trend,
What else more fit? We'll draw the latch-string

And close the door of sense; then satiate wend,
On poesy's transforming giant wing,
To worlds afar whose fruits all anguish mend.",ars poetica,types/modes,"['Ars Poetica', 'Public Domain']",First published in Poems (1909).

And for the first time heard you speak my name.
Then like the sun your sweetness overcame
My shy and shadowy mood; I was aware
That joy was hidden in your happy hair,
And that for you love held no hint of shame;
My eyes caught light from yours, within whose flame
Humor and passion have an equal share.

How many times since then have I not seen
Your great eyes widen when you talk of love,
And darken slowly with a fair desire;
How many times since then your soul has been
Clear to my gaze as curving skies above,
Wearing like them a raiment made of fire.

Sara Teasdale,1884 – 1933,Sappho,"The twilight’s inner flame grows blue and deep, 
And in my Lesbos, over leagues of sea, 
The temples glimmer moonwise in the trees. 
Twilight has veiled the little flower face 
Here on my heart, but still the night is kind 
And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast. 
Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk 
Along the surges creeping up the shore 
When tides came in to ease the hungry beach, 
And running, running, till the night was black, 
Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand 
And quiver with the winds from off the sea? 
Ah, quietly the shingle waits the tides 
Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me 
Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest. 
I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands 
And cried to Love, from whom the sea is sweet, 
From whom the sea is bitterer than death. 
Ah, Aphrodite, if I sing no more 
To thee, God’s daughter, powerful as God, 
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet 
To hold the added sweetness of a song. 
There is a quiet at the heart of love, 
And I have pierced the pain and come to peace. 
I hold my peace, my Cleïs, on my heart; 
And softer than a little wild bird’s wing 
Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth. 
Ah, never any more when spring like fire 
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves, 
Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude 
Beyond the lure of light Alcæus’ lyre, 
Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna’s voice. 
Ah, never with a throat that aches with song, 
Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring, 
Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love 
The quiver and the crying of my heart. 
Still I remember how I strove to flee 
The love-note of the birds, and bowed my head 
To hurry faster, but upon the ground 
I saw two wingèd shadows side by side, 
And all the world’s spring passion stifled me. 
Ah, Love, there is no fleeing from thy might, 
No lonely place where thou hast never trod, 
No desert thou hast left uncarpeted 
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet. 
In many guises didst thou come to me; 
I saw thee by the maidens while they danced, 
Phaon allured me with a look of thine, 
In Anactoria I knew thy grace, 
I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes; 
But never wholly, soul and body mine, 
Didst thou bid any love me as I loved. 
Now I have found the peace that fled from me; 
Close, close, against my heart I hold my world. 
Ah, Love that made my life a lyric cry, 
Ah, Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine, 
I taught the world thy music, now alone 
I sing for one who falls asleep to hear.",dramatic monologue,types/modes,"['Dramatic Monologue', 'Audio', 'Beauty', 'Desire', 'History', 'Love', 'Memories', 'Myth', 'Nature', 'Night', 'Oceans', 'Public Domain', 'LGBTQ Pride Month']","This poem is in the public domain.

Elinor Wylie,1885–1928,Wild Peaches,"                                1 

When the world turns completely upside down
You say we’ll emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
We’ll live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
You’ll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternut’s dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,
We’ll swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long,
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.


                                  2 

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
The misted early mornings will be cold;
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winter’s over.
By February you may find the skins
Of garter snakes and water moccasins
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.


                                  3 

When April pours the colors of a shell
Upon the hills, when every little creek
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek
Blue plums lie open to the blackbird’s beak,
We shall live well — we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches
We’ll trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.


                                  4 

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
There’s something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
There’s something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;
That spring, briefer than apple-blossom’s breath,
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Learning Resource', 'Living', 'Marriage & Companionship', 'Love', 'Romantic Love', 'Relationships', 'Home Life', 'Nature', 'Landscapes & Pastorals', 'Sonnet']",n/a,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48067/wild-peaches,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elinor-wylie,,1885.0,1928.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation

D. H. Lawrence,1885–1930,Bat,"At evening, sitting on this terrace,
When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara
Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...

When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing
Brown hills surrounding ...

When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio
A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,
Against the current of obscure Arno ...

Look up, and you see things flying
Between the day and the night;
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.

A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches
Where light pushes through;
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
A dip to the water.

And you think:
""The swallows are flying so late!""

Swallows?

Dark air-life looping
Yet missing the pure loop ...
A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight
And serrated wings against the sky,
Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
And falling back.

Never swallows!
Bats!
The swallows are gone.

At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats
By the Ponte Vecchio ...
Changing guard.

Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp
As the bats swoop overhead!
Flying madly.

Pipistrello!
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.
Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;

Wings like bits of umbrella.

Bats!

Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;
And disgustingly upside down.

Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags
And grinning in their sleep.
Bats!

In China the bat is symbol for happiness.

Robinson Jeffers,1887 – 1962,Wonder and Joy,"The things that one grows tired of—O, be sure
They are only foolish artificial things!
Can a bird ever tire of having wings?
And I, so long as life and sense endure,
(Or brief be they!) shall nevermore inure
My heart to the recurrence of the springs,
Of gray dawns, the gracious evenings,
The infinite wheeling stars. A wonder pure
Must ever well within me to behold
Venus decline; or great Orion, whose belt
Is studded with three nails of burning gold,
Ascend the winter heaven. Who never felt
This wondering joy may yet be good or great:
But envy him not: he is not fortunate.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Happiness', 'Public Domain']","This poem is in the public domain.

      And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping! 
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power, 
      To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, 
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary; 
      Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, 
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, 
      And all the little emptiness of love! 
Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there, 
      Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, 
            Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; 
Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long peace there,

Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

Rupert Brooke,1887–1915,The Dead (IV),"These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,

These had seen movement, and heard music; known

Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter

Settled at Balham by the end of June.

At home. And both were really quite content
With work and social pleasures. Then they died.

Rupert Brooke,1887–1915,Retrospect,"In your arms was still delight,
Quiet as a street at night;
And thoughts of you, I do remember,
Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,
Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.
Love, in you, went passing by,
Penetrative, remote, and rare,
Like a bird in the wide air,
And, as the bird, it left no trace
In the heaven of your face.
In your stupidity I found
The sweet hush after a sweet sound.
All about you was the light
That dims the greying end of night;
Desire was the unrisen sun,
Joy the day not yet begun,
With tree whispering to tree,
Without wind, quietly.
Wisdom slept within your hair,
And Long-Suffering was there,
And, in the flowing of your dress,
Undiscerning Tenderness.
And when you thought, it seemed to me,
Infinitely, and like a sea,
About the slight world you had known
Your vast unsconsciousness was thrown . . . 
    O haven without wave or tide!
Silence, in which all songs have died!
Holy book, where hearts are still!
And home at length under the hill!
O mother quiet, breasts of peace,
Where love itself would faint and cease!
O infinite deep I never knew,
I would come back, come back to you,
Find you, as a pool unstirred,
Kneel down by you, and never a word,
Lay my head, and nothing said,
In your hands, ungarlanded;
And a long watch you would keep;
And I should sleep, and I should sleep!",couplet,stanza forms,"['Appeared in Poetry Magazine', 'Living', 'Death', 'Love', 'Classic Love', 'Heartache & Loss', 'Romantic Love', 'Couplet']","Source:

Apart sweet women (for whom Heaven be blessed),
Comrades, you cannot think how thin and blue
Look the leftovers of mankind that rest,
Now that the cream has been skimmed off in you.
War has its horrors, but has this of good—
That its sure processes sort out and bind
Brave hearts in one intrepid brotherhood
And leave the shams and imbeciles behind.
Now turn we joyful to the great attacks,
Not only that we face in a fair field
Our valiant foe and all his deadly tools,
But also that we turn disdainful backs
On that poor world we scorn yet die to shield—
That world of cowards, hypocrites, and fools.

Who from their desk-chairs seeing a summer cloud
Race through blue heaven on its joyful course
Sigh sometimes for a life less cramped and bowed,
I think I might have done a great deal worse;
For I have ever gone untied and free,
The stars and my high thoughts for company;
Wet with the salt-spray and the mountain showers,
I have had the sense of space and amplitude,
And love in many places, silver-shoed,
Has come and scattered all my path with flowers.

Alan Seeger,1888 – 1916,Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France,"(To have been read before the statue of Lafayette and Washington in Paris, on Decoration Day, May 30, 1916)

I

Ay, it is fitting on this holiday,
Commemorative of our soldier dead,
When—with sweet flowers of our New England May
Hiding the lichened stones by fifty years made gray—
Their graves in every town are garlanded,
That pious tribute should be given too
To our intrepid few
Obscurely fallen here beyond the seas.
Those to preserve their country’s greatness died;
But by the death of these
Something that we can look upon with pride
Has been achieved, nor wholly unreplied
Can sneerers triumph in the charge they make
That from a war where Freedom was at stake
America withheld and, daunted, stood aside.

II

Be they remembered here with each reviving spring,
Not only that in May, when life is loveliest,
Around Neuville-Saint-Vaast and the disputed crest
Of Vimy, they, superb, unfaltering,
In that fine onslaught that no fire could halt,
Parted impetuous to their first assault;
But that they brought fresh hearts and springlike too
To that high mission, and ’tis meet to strew
With twigs of lilac and spring’s earliest rose
The cenotaph of those
Who in the cause that history most endears
Fell in the sunny morn and flower of their young years.

III

Yet sought they neither recompense nor praise,
Nor to be mentioned in another breath
Than their blue coated comrades whose great days
It was their pride to share—ay, share even to the death!
Nay, rather, France, to you they rendered thanks
(Seeing they came for honor, not for gain),
Who, opening to them your glorious ranks,
Gave them that grand occasion to excel,
That chance to live the life most free from stain
And that rare privilege of dying well.

IV

O friends! I know not since that war began
From which no people nobly stands aloof
If in all moments we have given proof
Of virtues that were thought American.
I know not if in all things done and said
All has been well and good,
Or if each one of us can hold his head
As proudly as he should,
Or, from the pattern of those mighty dead
Whose shades our country venerates to-day,
If we’ve not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray.
But you to whom our land’s good name is dear,
If there be any here
Who wonder if her manhood be decreased,
Relaxed its sinews and its blood less red
Than that at Shiloh and Antietam shed,
Be proud of these, have joy in this at least,
And cry: “Now heaven be praised
That in that hour that most imperilled her,
Menaced her liberty who foremost raised
Europe’s bright flag of freedom, some there were
Who, not unmindful of the antique debt,
Came back the generous path of Lafayette;
And when of a most formidable foe
She checked each onset, arduous to stem—
Foiled and frustrated them—
On those red fields where blow with furious blow
Was countered, whether the gigantic fray
Rolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot,
Accents of ours were in the fierce mêlée;
And on those furthest rims of hallowed ground
Where the forlorn, the gallant charge expires,
When the slain bugler has long ceased to sound,
And on the tangled wires
The last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops,
Withered beneath the shrapnel’s iron showers:—
Now heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops;
Now heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours.”

V.

There, holding still, in frozen steadfastness,
Their bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers,
They lie—our comrades—lie among their peers,
Clad in the glory of fallen warriors,
Grim clusters under thorny trellises,
Dry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores,
Leaves that made last year beautiful, still strewn
Even as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon;
And earth in her divine indifference
Rolls on, and many paltry things and mean
Prate to be heard and caper to be seen.
But they are silent, calm; their eloquence
Is that incomparable attitude;
No human presences their witness are,
But summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued,
And showers and night winds and the northern star.
Nay, even our salutations seem profane,
Opposed to their Elysian quietude;
Our salutations calling from afar,
From our ignobler plane
And undistinction of our lesser parts:
Hail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts.
Double your glory is who perished thus,
For you have died for France and vindicated us.",ode,types/modes,"['Ode', 'America', 'History', 'Public Domain', 'War', 'Memorial Day']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/ode-memory-american-volunteers-fallen-france,https://poets.org/poet/alan-seeger,2017,1888.0,1916.0,['Ode'],"['America', 'History', 'Public Domain', 'War']",['Memorial Day'],Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets

A cry of Absence, Absence, in the heart, 
And in the wood the furious winter blowing. 

Think not, when fire was bright upon my bricks 
And past the tight boards hardly a wind could enter, 
I glowed like them, the simple burning sticks, 
Far from my cause, my proper heat, my center. 

Better to walk forth in the murderous air 
And wash my wound in the snows; that would be healing,

Alan Seeger,1888–1916,The Hosts,"Purged, with the life they left, of all
That makes life paltry and mean and small,
In their new dedication charged
With something heightened, enriched, enlarged,
That lends a light to their lusty brows
And a song to the rhythm of their trampling feet,
These are the men that have taken vows,
These are the hardy, the flower, the élite,—
These are the men that are moved no more
By the will to traffic and grasp and store
And ring with pleasure and wealth and love
The circles that self is the centre of;
But they are moved by the powers that force
The sea for ever to ebb and rise,
That hold Arcturus in his course,
And marshal at noon in tropic skies
The clouds that tower on some snow-capped chain
And drift out over the peopled plain.
They are big with the beauty of cosmic things.
Mark how their columns surge! They seem
To follow the goddess with outspread wings
That points toward Glory, the soldier's dream.
With bayonets bare and flags unfurled,
They scale the summits of the world
And fade on the farthest golden height
In fair horizons full of light.

Comrades in arms there—friend or foe—
That trod the perilous, toilsome trail
Through a world of ruin and blood and woe
In the years of great decision—hail!
Friend or foe, it shall matter nought;
This only matters, in fine: we fought.
For we were young and in love or strife
Sought exultation and craved excess:
To sound the wildest debauch in life
We staked our youth and its loveliness.
Let idlers argue the right and wrong
And weigh what merit our causes had.
Putting our faith in being strong—
Above the level of good and bad—
For us, we battled and burned and killed
Because evolving Nature willed,
And it was our pride and boast to be
The instruments of Destiny.
There was a stately drama writ
By the hand that peopled the earth and air
And set the stars in the infinite
And made night gorgeous and morning fair,
And all that had sense to reason knew
That bloody drama must be gone through.
Some sat and watched how the action veered—
Waited, profited, trembled, cheered—
We saw not clearly nor understood,
But yielding ourselves to the master hand,
Each in his part as best he could,
We played it through as the author planned.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Couplet']","Source:

Alan Seeger,1888–1916,Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France,"(To have been read before the statue of Lafayette and Washington in Paris, on Decoration Day, May 30, 1916)


                                         I
Ay, it is fitting on this holiday,
Commemorative of our soldier dead,
When—with sweet flowers of our New England May
Hiding the lichened stones by fifty years made gray—
Their graves in every town are garlanded,
That pious tribute should be given too
To our intrepid few
Obscurely fallen here beyond their seas.
Those to preserve their country's greatness died;
But by the death of these
Something that we can look upon with pride
Has been achieved, nor wholly unreplied
Can sneerers triumph in the charge they make
That from a war where Freedom was at stake
America withheld and, daunted, stood aside.
                                         II
Be they remembered here with each reviving spring,
Not only that in May, when life is loveliest,
Around Neuville-Saint-Vaast and the disputed crest
Of Vimy, they, superb, unfaltering,
In that fine onslaught that no fire could halt,
Parted impetuous to their first assault;
But that they brought fresh hearts and springlike too
To that high mission, and 'tis meet to strew
With twigs of lilac and spring's earliest rose
The cenotaph of those
Who in the cause that history most endears
Fell in the sunny morn and flower of their young years.
                                         III
Yet sought they neither recompense nor praise,
Nor to be mentioned in another breath
Than their blue-coated comrades whose great days
It was their pride to share—ay, share even to the death!
Nay, rather, France, to you they rendered thanks
(Seeing they came for honour, not for gain),
Who, opening to them your glorious ranks,
Gave them that grand occasion to excel,
That chance to live the life most free from stain
And that rare privilege of dying well.
                                         IV
O friends! I know not since that war began
From which no people nobly stands aloof
If in all moments we have given proof
Of virtues that were thought American.
I know not if in all things done and said
All has been well and good,
Or of each one of us can hold his head
As proudly as he should,
Or, from the pattern of those mighty dead
Whose shades our country venerates to-day,
If we 've not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray,
But you to whom our land's good name is dear,
If there be any here
Who wonder if her manhood be decreased,
Relaxed its sinews and its blood less red
Than that at Shiloh and Antietam shed,
Be proud of these, have joy in this at least,
And cry: Now heaven be praised
That in that hour that most imperilled her,
Menaced her liberty who foremost raised
Europe's bright flag of freedom, some there were
Who, not unmindful of the antique debt,
Came back the generous path of Lafayette;
And when of a most formidable foe
She checked each onset, arduous to stem—
Foiled and frustrated them—
On those red fields where blow with furious blow
Was countered, whether the gigantic fray
Rolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot,
Accents of ours were in the fierce mêlée;
And on those furthest rims of hallowed ground
Where the forlorn, the gallant charge expires,
When the slain bugler has long ceased to sound,
And on the tangled wires
The last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops,
Withered beneath the shrapnel's iron showers:—
Now heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops;
Now heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours.'
                                         V
There, holding still, in frozen steadfastness,
Their bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers,
They lie—our comrades—lie among their peers,
Clad in the glory of fallen warriors,
Grim clustered under thorny trellises,
Dry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores,
Leaves that made last year beautiful, still strewn
Even as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon;
And earth in her divine indifference
Rolls on, and many paltry things and mean
Prate to be heard and caper to be seen.
But they are silent, clam; their eloquence
Is that incomparable attitude;
No human presences their witness are,
But summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued,
And showers and night winds and the northern star
Nay, even our salutations seem profane,
Opposed to their Elysian quietude;
Our salutations calling from afar,
From our ignobler plane
And undistinction of our lesser parts:
Hail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts.
Double your glory is who perished thus,
For you have died for France and vindicated us.",elegy,types/modes,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Ode', 'Elegy']",Unknown,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45080/ode-in-memory-of-the-american-volunteers-fallen-for-france,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alan-seeger,,1888.0,1916.0,[],[],[],Poetry Foundation
Claude McKay,1889 – 1948,When Dawn Comes to the City," The tired cars go grumbling by, 
        The moaning, groaning cars, 
    And the old milk carts go rumbling by 
        Under the same dull stars. 
    Out of the tenements, cold as stone, 
        Dark figures start for work; 
    I watch them sadly shuffle on,
        ’Tis dawn, dawn in New York. 

        But I would be on the island of the sea, 
        In the heart of the island of the sea, 
    Where the cocks are crowing, crowing, crowing, 
    And the hens are cackling in the rose-apple tree, 
Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing, 
        Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn, 
    And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing, 
And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying, 
And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling 
    From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea 
That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling 
    Sheer upon the flat rocks joyously! 
    There, oh, there! on the island of the sea, 
        There I would be at dawn. 

    The tired cars go grumbling by, 
        The crazy, lazy cars, 
    And the same milk carts go rumbling by 
        Under the dying stars. 
    A lonely newsboy hurries by, 
        Humming a recent ditty; 
    Red streaks strike through the gray of the sky, 
        The dawn comes to the city. 

        But I would be on the island of the sea, 
        In the heart of the island of the sea,

Claude McKay,1889 – 1948,Outcast,"For the dim regions whence my fathers came
My spirit, bondaged by the body, longs.
Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame;
My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs.
I would go back to darkness and to peace,
But the great western world holds me in fee,
And I may never hope for full release
While to its alien gods I bend my knee.
Something in me is lost, forever lost,
Some vital thing has gone out of my heart,

Your cosmopolitan sympathies.

You will do the same to a German

Less chanced than you for life,
Bonds to the whims of murder,

At the shrieking iron and flame

Whirl over the floor one fire.

See the gibbering shadows 
Mixed with the battled arms on the wall. 
See gargantuan hooked fingers 
Pluck in supreme flesh 
To smutch supreme littleness.

Isaac Rosenberg,1890–1918,God,"In his malodorous brain what slugs and mire,
Lanthorned in his oblique eyes, guttering burned!
His body lodged a rat where men nursed souls.
The world flashed grape-green eyes of a foiled cat
To him. On fragments of an old shrunk power,
On shy and maimed, on women wrung awry,
He lay, a bullying hulk, to crush them more.
But when one, fearless, turned and clawed like bronze,
Cringing was easy to blunt these stern paws,
And he would weigh the heavier on those after.

Who rests in God’s mean flattery now? Your wealth
Is but his cunning to make death more hard.
Your iron sinews take more pain in breaking.
And he has made the market for your beauty
Too poor to buy, although you die to sell.
Only that he has never heard of sleep;
And when the cats come out the rats are sly.
Here we are safe till he slinks in at dawn

But he has gnawed a fibre from strange roots,
And in the morning some pale wonder ceases.
Things are not strange and strange things are forgetful.
Ah! if the day were arid, somehow lost
Out of us, but it is as hair of us,
And only in the hush no wind stirs it.
And in the light vague trouble lifts and breathes,
And restlessness still shadows the lost ways.
The fingers shut on voices that pass through,
Where blind farewells are taken easily ....

Arthur Graeme West,1891–1917,The Night Patrol,"France, March 1916.

Over the top! The wire’s thin here, unbarbed
Plain rusty coils, not staked, and low enough:
Full of old tins, though—“When you’re through, all three,
Aim quarter left for fifty yards or so,
Then straight for that new piece of German wire;
See if it’s thick, and listen for a while
For sounds of working; don’t run any risks;
About an hour; now, over!”
                                                    And we placed
Our hands on the topmost sand-bags, leapt, and stood
A second with curved backs, then crept to the wire,
Wormed ourselves tinkling through, glanced back, and dropped.
The sodden ground was splashed with shallow pools,
And tufts of crackling cornstalks, two years old,
No man had reaped, and patches of spring grass.
Half-seen, as rose and sank the flares, were strewn
The wrecks of our attack: the bandoliers,
Packs, rifles, bayonets, belts, and haversacks,
Shell fragments, and the huge whole forms of shells
Shot fruitlessly—and everywhere the dead.
Only the dead were always present—present
As a vile sickly smell of rottenness;
The rustling stubble and the early grass,
The slimy pools — the dead men stank through all,
Pungent and sharp; as bodies loomed before,
And as we passed, they stank: then dulled away
To that vague fœtor, all encompassing,
Infecting earth and air. They lay, all clothed,
Each in some new and piteous attitude
That we well marked to guide us back: as he,
Outside our wire, that lay on his back and crossed
His legs Crusader-wise: I smiled at that,
And thought on Elia and his Temple Church.
From him, at quarter left, lay a small corpse,
Down in a hollow, huddled as in a bed,
That one of us put his hand on unawares.
Next was a bunch of half a dozen men
All blown to bits, an archipelago
Of corrupt fragments, vexing to us three,
Who had no light to see by, save the flares.
On such a trail, so light, for ninety yards
We crawled on belly and elbows, till we saw,
Instead of lumpish dead before our eyes,
The stakes and crosslines of the German wire.
We lay in shelter of the last dead man,
Ourselves as dead, and heard their shovels ring
Turning the earth, then talk and cough at times.
A sentry fired and a machine-gun spat;
They shot a glare above us, when it fell
And spluttered out in the pools of No Man’s Land,
We turned and crawled past the remembered dead:
Past him and him, and them and him, until,
For he lay some way apart, we caught the scent
Of the Crusader and slide past his legs,
And through the wire and home, and got our rum.",blank verse,meters,"['Social Commentaries', 'History & Politics', 'War & Conflict', 'Blank Verse']","Source:

Arthur Graeme West,1891–1917,"“God! How I hate you, you young cheerful men”","God! How I hate you, you young cheerful men,
Whose pious poetry blossoms on your graves

As soon as you are in them, nurtured up
By the salt of your corruption, and the tears
Of mothers, local vicars, college deans,
And flanked by prefaces and photographs
From all you minor poet friends—the fools—
Who paint their sentimental elegies
Where sure, no angel treads; and, living, share
The dead’s brief immortality
                                                    Oh Christ!
To think that one could spread the ductile wax
Of his fluid youth to Oxford’s glowing fires
And take her seal so ill! Hark how one chants—
“Oh happy to have lived these epic days”—
“These epic days”! And he’d been to France,
And seen the trenches, glimpsed the huddled dead
In the periscope, hung in the rusting wire:
Chobed by their sickley fœtor, day and night
Blown down his throat: stumbled through ruined hearths,
Proved all that muddy brown monotony,
Where blood’s the only coloured thing. Perhaps
Had seen a man killed, a sentry shot at night,
Hunched as he fell, his feet on the firing-step,
His neck against the back slope of the trench,
And the rest doubled up between, his head
Smashed like and egg-shell, and the warm grey brain
Spattered all bloody on the parados:
Had flashed a torch on his face, and known his friend,
Shot, breathing hardly, in ten minutes—gone!
Yet still God’s in His heaven, all is right
In the best possible of worlds. The woe,
Even His scaled eyes must see, is partial, only
A seeming woe, we cannot understand.
God loves us, God looks down on this our strife
And smiles in pity, blows a pipe at times
And calls some warriors home. We do not die,
God would not let us, He is too “intense,”
Too “passionate,” a whole day sorrows He
Because a grass-blade dies. How rare life is!
On earth, the love and fellowship of men,
Men sternly banded: banded for what end?
Banded to maim and kill their fellow men—
For even Huns are men. In heaven above
A genial umpire, a good judge of sport,
Won’t let us hurt each other! Let’s rejoice
God keeps us faithful, pens us still in fold.
Ah, what a faith is ours (almost, it seems,
Large as a mustard-seed)—we trust and trust,
Nothing can shake us! Ah, how good God is
To suffer us to be born just now, when youth
That else would rust, can slake his blade in gore,
Where very God Himself does seem to walk

At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.

Edna St. Vincent Millay,1892 – 1950,The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver,"“Son,” said my mother,
   When I was knee-high,
“You’ve need of clothes to cover you,
   And not a rag have I.

“There’s nothing in the house
   To make a boy breeches,
Nor shears to cut a cloth with
   Nor thread to take stitches.

“There’s nothing in the house
   But a loaf-end of rye,
And a harp with a woman’s head
   Nobody will buy,”
   And she began to cry.

That was in the early fall.
   When came the late fall,
“Son,” she said, “the sight of you
   Makes your mother’s blood crawl,—

“Little skinny shoulder-blades
   Sticking through your clothes!
And where you’ll get a jacket from
   God above knows.

“It’s lucky for me, lad,
   Your daddy’s in the ground,
And can’t see the way I let
   His son go around!”
   And she made a queer sound.

That was in the late fall.
   When the winter came,
I’d not a pair of breeches
   Nor a shirt to my name.

I couldn’t go to school,
   Or out of doors to play.
And all the other little boys
   Passed our way.

“Son,” said my mother,
   “Come, climb into my lap,
And I’ll chafe your little bones
   While you take a nap.”

And, oh, but we were silly
   For half an hour or more,
Me with my long legs
   Dragging on the floor,

A-rock-rock-rocking
   To a mother-goose rhyme!
Oh, but we were happy
   For half an hour’s time!

But there was I, a great boy,
   And what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me
   To sleep all day,
   In such a daft way?

Men say the winter
   Was bad that year;
Fuel was scarce,
   And food was dear.

A wind with a wolf’s head
   Howled about our door,
And we burned up the chairs
   And sat upon the floor.

All that was left us
   Was a chair we couldn’t break,
And the harp with a woman’s head
   Nobody would take,
   For song or pity’s sake.

The night before Christmas
   I cried with the cold,
I cried myself to sleep
   Like a two-year-old.

And in the deep night
   I felt my mother rise,
And stare down upon me
   With love in her eyes.

I saw my mother sitting
   On the one good chair,
A light falling on her
   From I couldn’t tell where,

Looking nineteen,
   And not a day older,
And the harp with a woman’s head
   Leaned against her shoulder.

Her thin fingers, moving
   In the thin, tall strings,
Were weav-weav-weaving
   Wonderful things.

Many bright threads,
   From where I couldn’t see,
Were running through the harp-strings
   Rapidly,

And gold threads whistling
   Through my mother’s hand.
I saw the web grow,
   And the pattern expand.

She wove a child’s jacket,
   And when it was done
She laid it on the floor
   And wove another one.

She wove a red cloak
   So regal to see,
“She’s made it for a king’s son,”
   I said, “and not for me.”
   But I knew it was for me.

She wove a pair of breeches
   Quicker than that!
She wove a pair of boots
   And a little cocked hat.

She wove a pair of mittens,
   She wove a little blouse,
She wove all night
   In the still, cold house.

She sang as she worked,
   And the harp-strings spoke;
Her voice never faltered,
   And the thread never broke.
   And when I awoke,—

There sat my mother
   With the harp against her shoulder
Looking nineteen
   And not a day older,

A smile about her lips,
   And a light about her head,
And her hands in the harp-strings
   Frozen dead.

And piled up beside her
   And toppling to the skies,
Were the clothes of a king’s son,
   Just my size.",ballad,verse forms,"['Ballad', 'Mothers', 'Music', 'Public Domain', 'Sons']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/ballad-harp-weaver,https://poets.org/poet/edna-st-vincent-millay,1922,1892.0,1950.0,['Ballad'],"['Mothers', 'Music', 'Public Domain', 'Sons']",[],Academy of American Poets

The far-reflected sky in dark of dream;
And glimpsed therein the sun-winged swallows seem
As fleeting memories to those who weep.

All hopes that token immortality,
All griefs whereto immortal grief aspires.

Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes

Yours is a spirit like a May-day song.

Wilfred Owen,1893–1918,Strange Meeting,"It seemed that out of battle I escaped 
Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped 
Through granites which titanic wars had groined. 
Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned, 
Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred. 
Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared 
With piteous recognition in fixed eyes, 
Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless. 
And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,— 
By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell. 
With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained; 
Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground, 
And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan. 
“Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.” 
“None,” said that other, “save the undone years, 
The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours, 
Was my life also; I went hunting wild 
After the wildest beauty in the world, 
Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair, 
But mocks the steady running of the hour, 
And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here. 
For by my glee might many men have laughed, 
And of my weeping something had been left, 
Which must die now. I mean the truth untold, 
The pity of war, the pity war distilled. 
Now men will go content with what we spoiled. 
Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled. 
They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress. 
None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress. 
Courage was mine, and I had mystery; 
Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery: 
To miss the march of this retreating world 
Into vain citadels that are not walled. 
Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, 
I would go up and wash them from sweet wells, 
Even with truths that lie too deep for taint. 
I would have poured my spirit without stint 
But not through wounds; not on the cess of war. 
Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were. 
“I am the enemy you killed, my friend. 
I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned 
Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed. 
I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.

                                   I. THE PROLOGUE
  
 Patting good-bye, doubtless they told the lad
 He’d always show the Hun a brave man’s face;
 Father would sooner him dead than in disgrace,—
 Was proud to see him going, aye, and glad.
 Perhaps his mother whimpered how she’d fret
 Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse.
 Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse …
 Brothers—would send his favourite cigarette.
 Each week, month after month, they wrote the same,
 Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut,
 Because he said so, writing on his butt
 Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim
 And misses teased the hunger of his brain.
 His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand
 Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand
 From the best sand-bags after years of rain.
 But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,
 Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld
 For torture of lying machinally shelled,
 At the pleasure of this world’s Powers who’d run amok.
  
 He’d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol.
 Their people never knew. Yet they were vile.
 ‘Death sooner than dishonour, that’s the style!’
 So Father said.
  
  
                                    II. THE ACTION
  
                               One dawn, our wire patrol
 Carried him. This time, Death had not missed.
 We could do nothing but wipe his bleeding cough.
 Could it be accident? - Rifles go off…
 Not sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)
  
  
                                    III. THE POEM
  
 It was the reasoned crisis of his soul
 Against more days of inescapable thrall,
 Against infrangibly wired and blind trench wall
 Curtained with fire, roofed in with creeping fire,
 Slow grazing fire, that would not burn him whole
 But kept him for death’s promises and scoff,
 And life’s half-promising, and both their riling.
  
  
                                    IV. THE EPILOGUE
  
 With him they buried the muzzle his teeth had kissed,
 And truthfully wrote the Mother, ‘Tim died smiling’.",couplet,stanza forms,"['Social Commentaries', 'War & Conflict', 'Mythology & Folklore', 'Horror', 'Couplet']","Source:

Charles Hamilton Sorley,1895 – 1915,Two Sonnets [XXXIII],"I

Saints have adorned the lofty soul of you.
Poets have whitened at your high renown.
We stand among the many millions who
Do hourly wait to pass your pathway down.
You, so familiar, once were strange: we tried
To live as of your presence unaware.
But now in every road on every side
We see your straight and steadfast signpost there.

I think it like that signpost in my land
Hoary and tall, which pointed me to go
Upward, into the hills, on the right hand,
Where the mists swim and the winds shriek and blow,
A homeless land and friendless, but a land
I did not know and that I wished to know.

II

Such, such is Death: no triumph: no defeat:
Only an empty pail, a slate rubbed clean,
A merciful putting away of what has been.

And this we know: Death is not Life effete,
Life crushed, the broken pail. We who have seen
So marvellous things know well the end not yet.

Victor and vanquished are a-one in death:
Coward and brave: friend, foe. Ghosts do not say,
“Come, what was your record when you drew breath?”
But a big blot has hid each yesterday
So poor, so manifestly incomplete.

Is touched, stirs, rises, opens and grows sweet

Across your dreams in pale battalions go,
Say not soft things as other men have said,
That you'll remember. For you need not so.
Give them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know
It is not curses heaped on each gashed head?
Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.
Nor honour. It is easy to be dead.
Say only this, “They are dead.” Then add thereto,
“Yet many a better one has died before.”

Joseph Auslander,1897 – 1965,I Know It Will Be Quiet When You Come,"I know it will be quiet when you come:
No wind; the water breathing steadily;
A light like ghost of silver on the sea;
And the surf dreamily fingering his drum.
Twilight will drift in large and leave me numb
With nearness to the last tranquility;
And then the slow and languorous tyranny
Of orange moon, pale night, and cricket hum.

And suddenly there will be twist of tide,
A rustling as of thin silk on the sand,
The tremor of a presence at my side,
The tremble of a hand upon my hand:
And pulses sharp with pain, and fires fanned,
And words that stumble into stars and hide.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Oceans', 'Public Domain', 'Silence']","This poem is in the public domain.

Léonie Adams,1899 – 1988,A Gull Goes Up,"Gulls when they fly move in a liquid arc,
Still head, and wings that bend above the breast, 
Covering its glitter with a cloak of dark,
Gulls fly. So as at last toward balm and rest, 
Remembering wings, the desperate leave their earth, 
Bear from their earth what there was ruinous-crossed,
Peace from distress, and love from nothing-worth, 
Fast at the heart, its jewels of dear cost.

Gulls go up hushed to that entrancing flight,
With never a feather of all the body stirred.
So in an air less rare than longing might 
The dream of flying lift a marble bird.
Desire it is that flies; then wings are freight

Sterling A. Brown,1901 – 1989,Challenge,"I said, in drunken pride of youth and you 
That mischief-making Time would never dare 
Play his ill-humored tricks upon us two, 
Strange and defiant lovers that we were.
I said that even Death, Highwayman Death,
Could never master lovers such as we,
That even when his clutch had throttled breath,
My hymns would float in praise, undauntedly.

Oh, I think honestly we knew no fear,

A lover come from legends long ago—
With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,
And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back
In a carven sheath of Tamarack.
He came with footsteps beautifully slow,
And spoke in voice meticulously low.
He came and Romance followed in his track...

I did not ask his name—I thought him Love;
I did not care to see his hidden face.

All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.

The golden increment of bursting fruit, 
Not always countenance, abject and mute,

Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;

White stars is no less lovely, being dark;
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall;

For that serene interminable hour 
When I shall leave this barmecidal feast, 
With poppy for my everlasting flower.

Of earth to which my lease will not expire,

Countee Cullen,1903 – 1946,"To John Keats, Poet, at Springtime ","I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
There never was a spring like this;
It is an echo, that repeats
My last year’s song and next year’s bliss. 
I know, in spite of all men say
Of Beauty, you have felt her most. 
Yea, even in your grave her way
Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost, 
Spring never was so fair and dear 
As Beauty makes her seem this year. 

I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
I am as helpless in the toil 
Of spring as any lamb that bleats 
To feel the solid earth recoil 
Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats 
Her tocsin call to those who love her, 
And lo! the dogwood petals cover 
Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek 
White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover 
About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek, 
While white and purple lilacs muster 
A strength that bears them to a cluster 
Of color and odor; for her sake 
All things that slept are now awake. 

And you and I, shall we lie still, 
John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
Somehow I feel your sensitive will 
Is pulsing up some tremulous 
Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
Grow music as they grow, since your 
Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
For life that opens death’s dark door. 
Though dust, your fingers still can push
The Vision Splendid to a birth, 
Though now they work as grass in the hush 
Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth. 

“John Keats is dead,” they say, but I 
Who hear your full insistent cry 
In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
Know John Keats still writes poetry. 
And while my head is earthward bowed
To read new life sprung from your shroud, 
Folks seeing me must think it strange 
That merely spring should so derange 
My mind. They do not know that you, 
John Keats, keep revel with me, too. ",elegy,types/modes,"['Elegy', 'Beauty', 'Death', 'Ghosts', 'Nature', 'Plants', 'Public Domain', 'Writing', 'Black History Month', 'Spring']","From Caroling Dusk (Harper & Brothers, 1927), edited by Countee Cullen. This poem is in the public domain.

Your dress a cloud of tangled midnight hair,
And love was much too much for me to wear
My leaves; the killer roared above his kill,
But you danced on, and when some star would spill
Its red and white upon you whirling there,
I sensed a hidden beauty in the air;
Though you danced on, my heart and I stood still.

But suddenly a bit of morning crept
Along your trembling sides of ebony;
I saw the tears your tired limbs had wept,
And how your breasts heaved high, how languidly
Your dark arms moved; I drew you close to me;
We flung ourselves upon our hill and slept.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Beauty', 'Love', 'Black History Month']","This poem is in the public domain.

Helene Johnson,1906 – 1995,Remember Not,"Remember not the promises we made
In this same garden many moons ago.
You must forget them. I would have it so.
Old vows are like old flowers as they fade
And vaguely vanish in a feeble death.
There is no reason why your hands should clutch
At pretty yesterdays. There is not much
Of beauty in me now. And though my breath
Is quick, my body sentient, my heart
Attuned to romance as before, you must
Not, through mistaken chivalry, pretend
To love me still. There is no mortal art
Can overcome Time’s deep, corroding rust.

Helen Hunt Jackson,,Dreams,"Mysterious shapes, with wands of joy and pain,
Which seize us unaware in helpless sleep,
And lead us to the houses where we keep
Our secrets hid, well barred by every chain
That we can forge and bind: the crime whose stain
Is slowly fading ’neath the tears we weep;
Dead bliss which, dead, can make our pulses leap—
Oh, cruelty! To make these live again!
They say that death is sleep, and heaven’s rest
Ends earth’s short day, as, on the last faint gleam
Of sun, our nights shut down, and we are blest.
Let this, then, be of heaven’s joy the test,
The proof if heaven be, or only seem,
That we forever choose what we will dream!",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Dreams', 'Public Domain']","This poem is in the public domain.

Clad in its robings of the summer past,
Dry, wan, and shivering in the wintry blast.
It will not pay the season’s rightful fee,—
It will not set its frost-burnt leafage free;
But like some palsied miser all aghast,
Who hoards his sordid treasure to the last,
It sighs, it moans, it sings in eldritch glee.
A foolish tree, to dote on summers gone;
A faithless tree, that never feels how spring
Creeps up the world to make a leafy dawn,
And recompense for all despoilment bring!

With failing hands to their vain semblance cling!",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Nature', 'Plants', 'Winter']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/winter-leafage,https://poets.org/poet/edith-matilda-thomas,2015,,,['Sonnet'],"['Nature', 'Plants']",['Winter'],Academy of American Poets
Ludwig Uhland,,From the German of Uhland,"Three students once tarried over the Rhine,
And into Frau Wirthin’s turned to dine.

“Say, hostess, have you good beer and wine?
And where is that pretty daughter of thine?”

“My beer and wine is fresh and clear.
My daughter lies on her funeral bier.”

They softly tipped into the room;
She lay there in the silent gloom.

The first the white cloth gently raised,
And tearfully upon her gazed.

“If thou wert alive, O, lovely maid,
My heart at thy feet would to-day be laid!”

The second covered her face again,
And turned away with grief and pain.

“Ah, thou upon thy snow-white bier!
And I have loved thee so many a year.”

The third drew back again the veil,
And kissed the lips so cold and pale.

“I’ve loved thee always, I love thee to-day,
And will love thee, yes, forever and aye!”

Bei einer Frau Wirthin, da kehrten sie ein.

„Frau Wirthin! hat Sie gut Bier und Wein?
Wo hat Sie Ihr schönes Töchterlein?“

„Mein Bier und Wein ist frisch und klar,
Mein Töchterlein liegt auf der Todtenbahr.“

Und als sie traten zur Kammer hinein,
Da lag sie in einem schwarzen Schrein.

Der erste, der schlug den Schleier zurück
Und schaute sie an mit traurigem Blick:

„Ach! lebtest du noch, du schöne Maid!
Ich würde dich lieben von dieser Zeit.“

Der zweite deckte den Schleier zu,
Und kehrte sich ab, und weinte dazu:

„Ach! daß du liegst auf der Todtenbahr!
Ich hab’ dich geliebet so manches Jahr.“

Lewis Grandison Alexander,,Japanese Hokku,"I. 
Life goes by moving, 
Up and down a chain of moods
Wanting what’s nothing.

My soul is the wind 
Dashing down fields of Autumn:
O, too swift to sing. 

III.
Listen to the rain
Falling broken on the ground:
Pity the sky once. 

IV.

Who stands above me seeing:
Tears of gratitude.

And die without moods.

VIII.

And hear my life sing.

Turn away your eyes.

XI.

Poems buried in my heart
Song that is no song … 

XII
The poetry of life?
No, the picture of my dreams 
Flashing on my heart.

XIII
I ride down the stream
Between the earth and the sun 
On the moon’s shadow.

XIV

A unit of the parade
There is no escape.

XV. 
Within the shadow 
I am weaving the pattern 
Of a spider web. 

XVI

Moans at the breast of the earth 
Being too full to sing. 

XVII
You are life’s fountain 
Springing from eternity 
Flow not recklessly.

XVIII

In the leaves of the lotus 
And send it to you.

Close yours out of love.

Euripides,,The Bird-Choros of Ion,"translated by H. D.

Birds from Parnassus,
swift
you dart
from the loftiest peaks;
you hover, dip,
you sway and perch
undaunted on the gold-set cornice;
you eagle,
god’s majestic legate,
who tear, who strike
song-birds in mid-flight,
my arrow whistles toward you,
swift
be off;

ah drift,
ah drift
so soft, so light,
your scarlet foot so deftly placed
to waft you neatly
to the pavement,
swan, swan
and do you really think
your song
that tunes the harp of Helios,
will save you
from the arrow-flight?
turn back,
back
to the lake of Delos;

lest all the song notes
pause and break
across a blood-stained throat
gone songless,
turn back,
back
ere it be too late,
to wave-swept Delos.

Alas, and still another,
what?
you’d place your mean nest
in the cornice?
sing, sing
my arrow-string,
tell to the thief
that plaits its house
for fledglings
in the god’s own house,
that still the Alpheus
whispers sweet
to lure
the birdlets to the place,
that still the Isthmus
shines with forests;
on the white statues
must be found
no straw nor litter
of bird-down,
Phœbos must have his portal fair;

and yet, O birds,
though this my labour
is set,
though this my task is clear,
though I must slay you,
I, god’s servant,
I who take here
my bread and life
and sweep the temple,
still I swear
that I would save you,
birds or spirits,
winged songs
that tell to men god’s will;

still, still
the Alpheus whispers clear
to lure the bird-folk
to its waters,
ah still
the Isthmus
blossoms fair;
lest all the song notes
pause and break
across a blood-stained throat
gone songless,
turn back,
back
ere it be too late,

The half of a sea-god’s skull. 

Half of a sea-god’s skull was there, 
Half of a sea-god’s tail. 
When I dug them out of the clutch of the sand
The peering moon went pale. 

The peering moon went pale, because
Her other eye had seen 
The other half of the sea-god’s bones
Ten thousand fathom green . . . 

Ten thousand fathom green with sea, 
The sea-god’s other bones 
Swayed in a dead sea-goddess’s arms
On a pile of sea-washed stones.

The south breeze seems to say as it flits from house to house, “To-day Bīnāpāni comes here to Bengal.” Arrayed in guise that would enrapture even sages, maid Nature has come to worship thy feet, O propitious one! See, O India, at this time all pay no heed to fear of plague, famine, earthquake; all put away pain and grief and gloom; to-day all are drunk with pleasure. For a year Nature was waiting in hope for this day to come. Many folk in many a fashion now summon thee, O white-armed one; I also have a mind to worship. Thy two feet are red lotuses; but, say, with what gift shall we worship thee, O mother Bināpāni? Ever sorrowful, ever ill-starred are we women of Bengal, all of us. Yet if thou have mercy, this utterly dependent one will worship thee with the gift of a single tear of devotion shed on thy lotus feet.

Gabriel de la Concepción Valdés,,Plácido’s Farewell to His Mother,"            ⁠If the unfortunate fate engulfing me, 
The ending of my history of grief, 
The closing of my span of years so brief, 
Mother, should wake a single pang in thee, 
Weep not. No saddening thought to me devote; 
I calmly go to a death that is glory-filled, 
My lyre before it is forever stilled 
Breathes out to thee its last and dying note. 

            ⁠A note scarce more than a burden-easing sigh, 
Tender and sacred, innocent, sincere— 
Spontaneous and instinctive as the cry 
I gave at birth—And now the hour is here— 
O God, thy mantle of mercy o’er my sins! 
Mother, farewell! The pilgrimage begins.

When night draws on, remembering keeps me wakeful  
And hinders my rest with grief upon grief returning

When, snatching their chance, they swiftly exchange the spear-thrusts!  
Ah, never of woe like this in the world of spirits  
I heard, or of loss like mine in the heart of woman.  
What Fortune might send, none stronger than he to bear it;  
None better to meet the trouble with mind unshaken;  
The kindest to help, wherever the need was sorest:  
They all had of him a boon—wife, friend, and suitor.  
O Ṣakhr! I will ne’er forget thee until in dying  
part from my soul, and earth for my tomb is cloven.

Soft as on an evening cloud the last sunset flush.

Sadly mourns the centaur troop from the classic lands,
Suddenly arrested on some distant shore,
By the cadence of the waves, like a funeral band,
Till they cover all the marge, and are heard no more.
Till the last faint ripple, with a sobbing breath,
Dies away in silence, and all is still as death.

Sacred swans of poesy, snow-white and snow-soft,
Floating heaps of slumber on waveless lakes afar;
Royal train of peacocks, with crested heads aloft,
Such as pace majestic, linked to Juno’s car.
Or in Versailles gardens step slowly one by one,
Past the steps of Pompadour’s rose-heaped, rose-hung throne.

Floating vapors slowly rise and wreathe, wind-swept and pale;
Hiding arching necks of snow, shining crests of blue;
Sad and sweet the murmurs through the misty veil,
Till the poet’s song resounds, the flowerless desert through;
And but for a moment rings the Sonatina’s lay,
Roaring winds and thunder peals sweep it far away.

                  *      *      *      *      *      *

The spectral Archer of the Northern sky,
Bends his great bow across the sphere on high;
Through the unmeasured realms of night and day,
Speeds his black arrow on its destined way.
It strikes, but pierces not, the poet’s breast,
His empty quiver near him lies at rest,
And over him sinks slowly in the West
            The Archer Boy.

Let no loud weeping chill the budding bloom,
That elves and nymphs have wreathed about his tomb,
The gentle Syrinx mourns his shortened years,
And on his laurels Pan sheds quiet tears;
In the cathedral raise the exile’s Psalm,
That through the transepts breathes like sorrow’s balm,
And in the tinted window rises calm
            The Archer Boy

And now the band of those who loved him best
Follows him slowly to his place of rest.
To the slow beating of the muffled drum
With heads bowed down and measured tread they come.
Pale and serene, fixed in triumphant peace,
His noble face bids lamentation cease,
His only fitting requiem shall be 
The pealing Psalm that tells of victory.
The blazoned banners float above his bier,
And from blue far-off waters rises clear
            The swan-song on the ear!",elegy,types/modes,"['Elegy', 'Death', 'Heroes', 'Mourning', 'Myth', 'Public Domain', 'Spanish', 'Translation', 'Hispanic Heritage Month']","From Pan-American Poems: An Anthology (The Gorham Press, 1918) by Agnes Blake Poor. This poem is in the public domain.

Fernando M. Maramág,,Moonlight on Manila Bay,"A light, serene, ethereal glory rests 
Its beams effulgent on each crestling wave; 
The silver touches of the moonlight wave 
The deep bare bosom that the breeze molests; 
While lingering whispers deepen as the wavy crests 
Roll with weird rhythm, now gay, now gently grave; 
And floods of lambent light appear the sea to pave— 
All cast a spell that heeds not time’s behests. 

Not always such the scene; the din of fight 
Has swelled the murmur of the peaceful air; 
Here East and West have oft displayed their might; 
Dark battle clouds have dimmed this scene so fair; 
Here bold Olympia, one historic night, 
Presaging freedom, claimed a people’s care.

Timothy Thomas Fortune,,Edgar Allan Poe,"I know not why, but it is true—it may,
In some way, be because he was a child
Of the fierce sun where I first wept and smiled—
I love the dark-browed Poe. His feverish day
Was spent in dreams inspired, that him beguiled,
When not along his path shone forth one ray
Of light, of hope, to guide him on the way,
That to earth's cares he might be reconciled.
Not one of all Columbia's tuneful choir
Has pitched his notes to such a matchless key
As Poe—the wizard of the Orphic lyre!

Helen Hay Whitney,,With Music,"Dear, did we meet in some dim yesterday?
    I half remember how the birds were mute
    Among green leaves and tulip-tinted fruit,
And on the grass, beside a stream, we lay
In early twilight; faintly, far away,
    Came lovely sounds adrift from silver lute,
    With answered echoes of an airy flute,
While Twilight waited tiptoe, fain to stay.

Her violet eyes were sweet with mystery.
    You looked in mine, the music rose and fell
Like little, lisping laughter of the sea;
        Our souls were barks, wind-wafted from the shore—
     Gold cup, a rose, a ruby, who can tell?
         Soft—music ceases—I recall no more.

Hast thou not shone upon!
How many tears, O light,
Have dropped before thy sight!
How many heart-felt sighs,
How many piercing cries,
How many deeds of woe,
Dost thy bright light not know!
How many broken hearts,
That are pierced by sorrow’s darts
How many maddened brains,
That are wild with passion’s rains;
How many soul-sick lives,
Stabbed with despair’s sharp knives,
Hast thou above the skies,
Not seen with thy radiant eyes!
Shine on, majestic one!

With your fair eyes a charming light I see,

    Stayed by your feet, the burden I sustain
    Which my lame feet find all too strong for me;
Wingless upon your pinions forth I fly;

The yellow birch-leaves shine like bright coins strung
On wands; the chestnut's yellow pennons tongue
To every wind its harvest challenge. Steeped
In yellow, still lie fields where wheat was reaped;
And yellow still the corn sheaves, stacked among
The yellow gourds, which from the earth have wrung
Her utmost gold. To highest boughs have leaped
The purple grape,—last thing to ripen, late
By very reason of its precious cost.

Amid the mangoe clumps of green profound,

It is immortal as immaculate Truth,

Drops from the stem of life—for it will grow,
In barren regions, where no waters flow,

That but itself and darkness nought doth show,
It is my love's being yet it cannot die,
Nor will it change, though all be changed beside;

Though vows be false, and faith itself deny,
Though sharp enjoyment be a suicide,

—Mondego! though I bend my pilgrim way 
To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career, 
Still—nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe,

To make thee less to this sad bosom dear; 
And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!

Anna Williams,,On the Death of Sir Erasmus Philips,"Unfortunately drowned in the River Avon, near Bath, October 15, 1743

Why dash the floods! What cries my soul affright! 
How steep the precipice! How dark the night! 
Then Virtue sunk in Avon’s fatal wave, 
No friend to succour, no kind hand to save;  
The circling waters hide his sinking head, 
The treach’rous bottom forms his oozy bed.  
Behold the bloated corpse, the visage pale;  
See here what virtue, wealth, and birth avail. 
What now remains beneath this load of pain? 
To weep is nature, but to weep is vain. 
What now remains? It yet remains to try  
What hope, what peace, religion can supply:  
It yet remains to catch the parting ray, 
To note his worth ere mem’ry fade away, 
To mark how various excellence combin’d,  
Recount his virtues, and transcribe his mind.  
It yet remains with holy rites to lay, 
The breathless reliques in their kindred day. 
Ye wise, ye good, the holy rites attend, 
Here lies the wise man’s guide, the good man’s friend. 
Awhile let faith exalt th’ adoring eye,  
And meditation deep suspend the sigh; 
Then close the grave, and sound the fun’ral knell, 
Each drop a tear, and take a last farewell;

Thomas Gray,,Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
  The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
  And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower
  The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
  Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade
  Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
  The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn
  Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
How jocund did they drive their team afield!
  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
  Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
  The short and simple annals of the Poor.

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
  And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:—
  The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault
  If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

Can storied urn or animated bust
  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath,
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
  Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
  Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:

But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
  Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
  And froze the genial current of the soul.

Full many a gem of purest ray serene
  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast
  The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
  Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.

Th' applause of listening senates to command,
  The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
  And read their history in a nation's eyes

Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone
  Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;
Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,
  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
  They kept the noiseless tenour of their way.

Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect
  Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,
  The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
  That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
  Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
  E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.

For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,
  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,
  Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate,—

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
  'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,
  To meet the sun upon the upland lawn;

'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
  That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noon-tide would he stretch,
  And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
  Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;
Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,
  Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
  Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
  Nor up the",elegy,types/modes,"['Elegy', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/elegy-written-country-churchyard,https://poets.org/poet/thomas-gray,1751,,,['Elegy'],['Public Domain'],[],Poetry Foundation / Academy of American Poets
Homer,,"The Iliad, Book XVIII, [The Shield of Achilles] ","Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son.


""Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls
(So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls?
'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,
And Vulcan's joy and duty to obey.""

To whom the mournful mother thus replies:
(The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)
""O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine
So pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?
Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare
For Thetis only such a weight of care?
I, only I, of all the watery race
By force subjected to a man's embrace,
Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays
The mighty fine imposed on length of days.
Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,
The bravest sure that ever bore the name;
Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand
He grew, he flourish'd, and he graced the land:
To Troy I sent him! but his native shore
Never, ah never, shall receive him more;
(Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)
Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!
Robb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,
The king of nations forced his royal slave:
For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress'd
Required his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd.
Large gifts they promise, and their elders send;
In vain--he arms not, but permits his friend
His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ:
He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy:
Then slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name)
At once resigns his armour, life, and fame.
But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won:
Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son,
And to the field in martial pomp restore,
To shine with glory, till he shines no more!""

To her the artist-god: ""Thy griefs resign,
Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine.
O could I hide him from the Fates, as well,
Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel,
As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze
Of wondering ages, and the world's amaze!""

Thus having said, the father of the fires
To the black labours of his forge retires.
Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd
Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd,
Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,
And twenty forges catch at once the fires;
Just as the god directs, now loud, now low,
They raise a tempest, or they gently blow;
In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,
And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;
Before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand;
The ponderous hammer loads his better hand,
His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,
And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.

Then first he form'd the immense and solid shield;
Rich various artifice emblazed the field;
Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;
A silver chain suspends the massy round;
Five ample plates the broad expanse compose,
And godlike labours on the surface rose.
There shone the image of the master-mind:
There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd;
The unwearied sun, the moon completely round;
The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd;
The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;
And great Orion's more refulgent beam;
To which, around the axle of the sky,
The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,
Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.

Two cities radiant on the shield appear,
The image one of peace, and one of war.
Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,
And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;
Along the street the new-made brides are led,
With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:
The youthful dancers in a circle bound
To the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound:
Through the fair streets the matrons in a row
Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.

There in the forum swarm a numerous train;
The subject of debate, a townsman slain:
One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,
And bade the public and the laws decide:
The witness is produced on either hand:
For this, or that, the partial people stand:
The appointed heralds still the noisy bands,
And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:
On seats of stone, within the sacred place,
The reverend elders nodded o'er the case;
Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,
And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke
Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,
The prize of him who best adjudged the right.

Another part (a prospect differing far)(255)
Glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.
Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,
And one would pillage, one would burn the place.
Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,
A secret ambush on the foe prepare:
Their wives, their children, and the watchful band
Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.
They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:
Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,
And gold their armour: these the squadron led,
August, divine, superior by the head!
A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,
Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.
Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem
If sheep or oxen seek the windin",ekphrasis,types/modes,"['Ekphrastic', 'Public Domain']",Translated by Alexander Pope.  This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/iliad-book-xviii-shield-achilles,https://poets.org/poet/homer,1715,,,['Ekphrastic'],['Public Domain'],[],Academy of American Poets
Lord Brooke Fulke Greville,,Sonnet 100,"In night when colors all to black are cast,
Distinction lost, or gone down with the light;
The eye a watch to inward senses placed,
Not seeing, yet still having powers of sight,

Gives vain alarums to the inward sense,
Where fear stirred up with witty tyranny,
Confounds all powers, and thorough self-offense,
Doth forge and raise impossibility:

Such as in thick depriving darknesses,
Proper reflections of the error be,
And images of self-confusednesses,
Which hurt imaginations only see;

And from this nothing seen, tells news of devils,
Which but expressions be of inward evils.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Halloween']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/sonnet-100,https://poets.org/poet/lord-brooke-fulke-greville,1633,,,['Sonnet'],[],['Halloween'],Academy of American Poets
Anonymous,,The Unquiet Grave,"I

'The wind doth blow today, my love,
  And a few small drops of rain;
I never had but one true-love;
  In cold grave she was lain.

II

'I'll do as much for my true-love
  As any young man may;
I'll sit and mourn all at her grave
  For a twelvemonth and a day.'

III

The twelvemonth and a day being up,
  The dead began to speak:
'Oh who sits weeping on my grave,
  And will not let me sleep?'—

IV

''Tis I, my love, sits on your grave,
  And will not let you sleep;
For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips,
  And that is all I seek.'—

V

'You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips;
  But my breath smells earthy strong;
If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips,
  Your time will not be long.

VI

''Tis down in yonder garden green,
  Love, where we used to walk,
The finest flower that ere was seen
  Is wither'd to a stalk.

VII

'The stalk is wither'd dry, my love,
  So will our hearts decay;
So make yourself content, my love,
  Till God calls you away.'",ballad,verse forms,"['Ballad', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/unquiet-grave,https://poets.org/poet/anonymous,1400,,,['Ballad'],['Public Domain'],[],Academy of American Poets
Henry Howard,,"Sonnet 7 [The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings] ","The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings
With green hath clad the hill and eke the vale;
The nightingale with feathers new she sings;
And turtle to her make hath told her tale.
Summer is come, for every spray now springs;
The hart hath hung his old head on the pale;
The buck in brake his winter coat he flings;
The fishes flete with new repairèd scale;
The adder all her slough away she slings;
The swift swalllow pursueth the flies small;
The busy bee her honey now she mings;
Winter is worn that was the flowers' bale.
And thus I see among these pleasant things
Each care decays, and yet my sorrow springs.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Public Domain', 'Summer']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/sonnet-7-soote-season-bud-and-bloom-forth-brings,https://poets.org/poet/henry-howard,1374,,,['Sonnet'],['Public Domain'],['Summer'],Academy of American Poets

Henry Howard,,"Sonnet 12 [Alas, so all things now do hold their peace] ","Alas, so all things now do hold their peace,
Heaven and earth disturbèd in no thing;
The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease;
The nightes car the stars about doth bring.
Calm is the sea, the waves work less and less.
So am not I, whom love, alas, doth wring,
Bringing before my face the great increase
Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing
In joy and woe, as in a doubtful ease.
For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring,
But by and by the cause of my disease
Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting,
When that I think what grief it is again
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.",sonnet,verse forms,"['Sonnet', 'Heartache', 'Public Domain']",This poem is in the public domain.,https://poets.org/poem/sonnet-12-alas-so-all-things-now-do-hold-their-peace,https://poets.org/poet/henry-howard,,,,['Sonnet'],"['Heartache', 'Public Domain']",[],Academy of American Poets
